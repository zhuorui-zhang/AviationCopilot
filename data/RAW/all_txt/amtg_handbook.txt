# Aviation Maintenance  Technician Handbook–General  

2023 The  Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–General (FAA-H-8083-30B)  was developed as one of a series of three  handbooks for persons preparing for mechanic certification with airframe or powerplant ratings, or both. It is intended that  this handbook will provide basic information on principles, fundamentals, and technical procedures in the subject matter  areas common to both the airframe and powerplant ratings. Emphasis in this volume is on theory and methods of application.  

The handbook is designed to aid students enrolled in a formal course of instruction preparing for FAA certification as a  maintenance technician as well as for current technicians who wish to improve their knowledge. This volume contains  information on mathematics, aircraft drawings, weight and balance, aircraft materials, processes and tools, physics, electricity,  inspection, ground operations, and FAA regulations governing the certification and work of maintenance technicians. New to  this volume is a section addressing how successful aviation maintenance technicians incorporate knowledge and awareness  of ethics, professionalism and human factors in the field.  

Because there are so many different types of airframes and powerplants in use today, it is reasonable to expect that differences  exist in the components and systems of each. To avoid undue repetition, the practice of using representative systems and  units is implemented throughout the handbook. Subject matter treatment is from a generalized point of view, and should be  supplemented by reference to manufacturers’ manuals or other publications if more detail is desired. This handbook is not  intended to replace, substitute for, or supersede official regulations or the manufacturers’ instructions.  

The companion handbooks to  Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–General (FAA-H-8083-30B)  are the  Aviation  Maintenance Technician Handbook–Airframe (FAA-H-8083-31 (as amended)) , and the  Aviation Maintenance Technician  Handbook–Powerplant (FAA-H-8083-32 (as amended)) .  

This handbook is available for download, in pdf format, from  www.faa.gov . Please visit this website for the latest version  of all FAA handbooks.  

This handbook is published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Airman Testing  Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125.

# Chapter 1 Safety, Ground Operations, &  Servicing  

Aviation maintenance technicians (AMTs) devote a portion of  their aviation career to ground handling and operating aircraft.  Technicians also need to be proficient in operating ground  support equipment. The complexity of support equipment and  the hazards involved in the ground handling of aircraft require  that maintenance technicians possess a detailed knowledge of  safety procedures used in aircraft servicing, taxiing, run-up,  and in the use of ground support equipment. The information  provided in this chapter is intended as a general guide for  safely servicing and operating aircraft.  

Introducing human factors to aircraft maintenance personnel  makes them aware of how it affects maintenance performance.  Although there are many human factors involved when  dealing with maintenance performance, several areas can be  considered. Some of these include fatigue, deadline pressure,  stress, distractions, poor communication skills, complacency,  and lack of information. Maintenance technicians need to  understand how human factors can impact their performance  and safety while completing maintenance tasks.  

# Shop Safety  

Keeping the shop, hangars, and flight line clean is essential  to safety and efficient maintenance. The highest standards of  orderly work arrangements and cleanliness must be observed  during the maintenance of aircraft. Where continuous  work shifts are established, the outgoing shift removes and  properly stores personal tools, rollaway boxes, work stands,  maintenance stands, hoses, electrical cords, hoists, crates,  and boxes that were needed for the work to be accomplished.  

Signs are posted to indicate dangerous equipment or hazardous  conditions. Additionally, there are signs that provide the  location of first aid and fire equipment. Safety lanes, pedestrian  walkways, and fire lanes are painted around the perimeter  inside the hangars. This is a safety measure to prevent accidents  and to keep pedestrian traffic out of work areas.  

Safety is everyone’s business. However, technicians and  supervisors must watch for their own safety and for the  safety of others working around them. Communication is  key to ensuring everyone’s safety. If other personnel are  conducting their actions in an unsafe manner, communicate  with them, reminding them of their safety and that of others  around them.  

# Electrical Safety Physiological Safety  

Working with electrical equipment poses certain physiological  safety hazards. When electricity is applied to the human body,  it can create severe burns in the area of entrance and at the  point of exit from the body. In addition, the nervous system is  affected and can be damaged or destroyed. To safely deal with  electricity, the technician must have a working knowledge  of the principles of electricity and a healthy respect for its  capability to do both work and damage.  

Wearing or use of proper safety equipment can provide a  psychological assurance and physically protect the user  at the same time. The use of rubber gloves, safety glasses,  rubber or grounded safety mats, and other safety equipment  contributes to the overall safety of the technician working  on or with electrical equipment.  

Two factors that affect safety when dealing with electricity are  fear and overconfidence. These two factors are major causes  of accidents involving electricity. While a certain amount of  respect for electrical equipment is healthy and a certain level  of confidence is necessary, extremes of either can be deadly.  

Lack of respect is often due to lack of knowledge. Personnel  who attempt to work with electrical equipment and have  no knowledge of the principles of electricity lack the skills  to deal with electrical equipment safely. Overconfidence  leads to risk taking. The technician who does not respect  the capabilities of electricity will, sooner or later, become a  victim of electricity’s power.  

# Fire Safety  

Anytime current flows, whether during generation or  transmission, a by-product is heat. The greater the current  flow, the greater the amount of heat created. When this heat  becomes too great, protective coatings on wiring and other  electrical devices can melt, causing shorting. That in turn  leads to more current flow and greater heat. This heat can  become so great that metals can melt, liquids vaporize, and  flammable substances ignite.  

An important factor in preventing electrical fires is to keep  the area around electrical work or electrical equipment  clean, uncluttered, and free of all unnecessary flammable  substances. Ensure that all power cords, wires, and lines  are free of kinks and bends that can damage the wire. Never  place wires or cords where they may be walked on or run  over by other equipment. When several wires inside a power  cord are broken, the current passing through the remaining  wires increases. This generates more heat than the insulation  coatings on the wire are designed to withstand and can  lead to a fire. Closely monitor the condition of electrical  equipment. Repair or replace damaged equipment before  further use.  

# Safety Around Compressed Gases  

Compressed air, like electricity, is an excellent tool when  it is under control. A typical nitrogen bottle set is shown  in  Figure 1-1 . The following “dos and don’ts” apply when  working with or around compressed gases:  

•	 Inspect air hoses frequently for breaks and worn spots.  Unsafe hoses must be replaced immediately. •	 Keep all connections in a “no-leak condition.” •	 Maintain in-line oilers, if installed, in operating  condition. •	 Ensure the system has water sumps installed and  drained at regular intervals. •	 Filter air used for paint spraying to remove oil and  water. •	 Never use compressed air to clean hands or clothing.  Pressure can force debris into the flesh leading to  infection. •	 Never spray compressed air in the area of other  personnel. •	 Straighten, coil, and properly store air hoses when not  in use. •	 Many accidents involving compressed gases occur  during aircraft tire mounting. To prevent possible  personal injury, use tire dollies and other appropriate  devices to mount or remove heavy aircraft tires.  

When inflating tires on any type of aircraft wheels, always  use tire cage guards. Extreme caution is required to avoid  over inflation of high-pressure tires because of possible  personal injury. Use pressure regulators on high-pressure air  bottles to eliminate the possibility of over inflation of tires.  Tire cages are not required when adjusting pressure in tires  installed on an aircraft.  

# Safety Around Hazardous Materials  

Material safety diamonds are important with regard to  shop safety. These diamond-shaped labels are a simple  and quick way to determine the risk of hazardous material  within the associated container and, if used properly with  the tags, indicate what personal safety equipment to use.  

The most observable portion of the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)  (formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS))  label is the risk diamond. It is a four-color segmented  diamond that represents flammability (red), reactivity  (yellow), health (blue), and special hazard (white). In the  flammability, reactivity, and health blocks, there is a number  from 0 to 4. Zero represents little or no hazard to the user,  while 4 means that the material is very hazardous. The special  hazard segment contains a word or abbreviation to represent  the specific hazard. Some examples are RAD for radiation,  ALK for alkali materials, Acid for acidic materials, and  CARC for carcinogenic materials. The letter W with a line  through it stands for high reactivity to water.  [Figure 1-2]  

The SDS is a more detailed version of the chemical safety  issues. These forms have the detailed breakdown of the  chemicals, including formulas and action to take if personnel  come in contact with the chemicals. All sheets have the same  information requirements; however, the exact location of the  information on the sheet may vary depending on the SDS  manufacturer. These forms are necessary for a safe shop that  meets all the requirements of the governing safety body, the  U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA).  

# Safety Around Machine Tools  

Hazards in a shop increase when the operation of lathes, drill  presses, grinders, and other types of machines are used. Each  machine has its own set of safety practices. The following  discussions are necessary to avoid injury.  

The drill press can be used to bore and ream holes, to do  facing, milling, and other similar types of operations. The  following precautions can reduce the chance of injury:  

•	 Wear eye protection. •	 Securely clamp all work. •	 Set the proper revolutions per minute (rpm) for the  material used. •	 Do not allow the spindle to feed beyond its limit of  travel while drilling. •	 Stop the machine before adjusting work or attempting  to remove jammed work. •	 Clean the area when finished.  

Lathes are used in turning work of a cylindrical nature.  This work may be performed on the inside or outside of the  cylinder. The work is secured in the chuck to provide the  rotary motion, and the forming is done by contact with a  

# during milling.  

![](images/20058d0b236455dc6d46a41814dd62b99b1914e9b2fdc13ec5bed4ee500620ca.jpg)

securely mounted tool. The following precautions can reduce  the chance of injury:  

•	 Wear eye protection. •	 Use sharp cutting tools. •	 Allow the chuck to stop on its own. Do not attempt to  stop the chuck by hand pressure. •	 Examine tools and work for cracks or defects before  starting the work. •	 Do not set tools on the lathe. Tools may be caught by  the work and thrown. •	 Before measuring the work, allow it to stop in the lathe.  

Milling machines are used to shape or dress; cut gear  teeth, slots, or key ways; and similar work. The following  precautions can reduce the chance of injury:  

•	 Wear eye protection. •	 Clean the work bed prior to work. •	 Secure the work to the bed to prevent movement  

•	 Select the proper tools for the job. •	 Do not change the feed speed while working. •	 Lower the table before moving under or away from  the work. •	 Ensure all clamps and bolts are passable under  the arbor.  

Grinders are used to sharpen tools, dress metal, and perform  other operations involving the removal of small amounts  of metal. The following precautions can reduce the chance  of injury:  

•	 Wear eye protection, even if the grinder has a shield. •	 Inspect the grinding wheel for defects prior to use. •	 Do not force grinding wheels onto the spindle. They fit  snugly but do not require force to install them. Placing  side pressure on a wheel could cause it to explode. •	 Check the wheel flanges and compression washer.  They should be one-third the diameter of the wheel. •	 Do not stand in the arc of the grinding wheel while  operating in case the wheel explodes.  

Welding must be performed only in designated areas. Any  part that is to be welded must be removed from the aircraft, if  possible. Repair would then be accomplished in a controlled  environment, such as a welding shop. A welding shop must  be equipped with proper tables, ventilation, tool storage, and  fire prevention and extinguishing equipment.  

![](images/4068d3ec657f77b3750b24fc665f15e61e3dc4b6e0e50a1627e6752aab82e391.jpg)  
Figure 1-2.   A risk diamond.  

# Foreign Object Damage (FOD)  

Welding on an aircraft should be performed outside, if  possible. If welding in the hangar is necessary, observe  these precautions:  

•	 During welding operations, open fuel tanks and work  on fuel systems are not permitted. •	 Painting is not permitted. •	 No aircraft are to be within 35 feet of the welding  operation. •	 No flammable material is permitted in the area around  the welding operation. •	 Only qualified welders are permitted to do the work. •	 The welding area is to be roped off and placarded. •	 Fire extinguishing equipment of a minimum rating  of 20B must be in the immediate area with 80B rated  equipment as a backup. •	 Trained fire watches are to be present in the area  around the welding operation. •	 The aircraft being welded must be in a towable  condition, with a tug attached, and the aircraft parking  brakes released. A qualified operator must be on the  tug and mechanics available to assist in the towing  operation should it become necessary to tow the  aircraft. If the aircraft is in the hangar, the hangar  doors are to be open.  

# Flight Line Safety  

# Hearing Protection  

The flight line is a place of dangerous activity. Technicians  who perform maintenance on the flight line must constantly  be aware of what is going on around them. The noise on a  flight line comes from many places. Aircraft are only one  source of noise. There are auxiliary power units (APUs), fuel  trucks, baggage handling equipment, and so forth. Each has  its own frequency of sound. Combined all together, the noise  on the ramp or flight line can cause hearing loss.  

There are many types of hearing protection available.  Hearing protection can be external or internal. Earmuffs or  headphones are considered external protection. The internal  type of hearing protection fits into the auditory canal. Both  types reduce the sound level reaching the eardrum and reduce  the chances of hearing loss.  

Hearing protection is essential when working with  pneumatic drills, rivet guns, or other loud tools. Even short  duration exposure to these sounds can cause hearing loss  because of their high frequency. Continued exposure will  cause hearing loss.  

Foreign object damage (FOD) is any damage to aircraft,  personnel, or equipment caused by any loose object. These  loose objects can be anything, such as broken runway  concrete, shop towels, safety wire, etc. To control FOD, keep  ramp and operation areas clean, have a tool control program,  and provide convenient receptacles for used hardware, shop  towels, and other consumables.  

Never leave tools or other items around the intake of a turbine  engine. The modern gas turbine engine creates a low-pressure  area in front of the engine that causes any loose object to  be drawn into the engine. The exhaust of these engines  can propel loose objects great distances with enough force  to damage anything that is hit. The importance of a FOD  program cannot be overstressed when a technician considers  the cost of engines, components, or a human life.  

# Safety Around Airplanes  

As with the previously mentioned items, it is important to  be aware of propellers. Technicians cannot assume the pilot  of a taxiing aircraft can see them and must stay within the  pilot’s view while on the ramp area. Turbine engine intakes  and exhaust can also be very hazardous areas. Smoking or  open flames are not permitted anywhere near an aircraft in  operation. Be aware of aircraft fluids that can be detrimental  to skin. When operating support equipment around aircraft,  be sure to allow space between it and the aircraft, and secure  it so it cannot roll into the aircraft. All items in the area of  operating aircraft must be stowed properly.  

# Safety Around Helicopters  

Every type of helicopter has different features. These  differences must be learned to avoid damaging the helicopter  or injuring the technician. When approaching a helicopter  while the blades are turning, adhere to the following  guidelines to ensure safety.  

•	 Observe the rotor head and blades to see if they  are level. This allows maximum clearance when  approaching the helicopter. •	 Approach the helicopter in view of the pilot. •	 Never approach a helicopter carrying anything with  a vertical height that the blades could hit. This could  cause blade damage and injury to the individual. •	 Never approach a single-rotor helicopter from the rear.  The tail rotor is invisible when operating. •	 Never go from one side of the helicopter to the other  by going around the tail. Always go around the nose  of the helicopter.  

When securing the rotor on helicopters with elastomeric  bearings, check the maintenance manual for the proper  method. Using the wrong method could damage the bearing.  

# Fire Safety  

Performing maintenance on aircraft and their components  requires the use of electrical tools that can produce sparks,  heat-producing tools and equipment, flammable and  explosive liquids, and gases. As a result, a high potential  exists for fire to occur. Measures must be taken to prevent a  fire from occurring and to have a plan for extinguishing it.  

The key to fire safety is knowledge of what causes a fire, how  to prevent it, and how to put it out. This knowledge must be  instilled in each technician, emphasized by their supervisors  through sound safety programs, and occasionally practiced.  Airport or other local fire departments can normally be  called upon to assist in training personnel and helping to  establish fire safety programs for the hangar, shops, and  flight line.  

# Fire Protection  

# Requirements for Fire to Occur  

Three things are required for a fire. Remove any one of these  things and the fire extinguishes:  

1.	 Fuel—combines with oxygen in the presence of heat,  releasing more heat. As a result, it reduces itself to  other chemical compounds. 2.	  Heat—accelerates the combining of oxygen with fuel,  in turn releasing more heat. 3.	 Oxygen—the element that combines chemically with  another substance through the process of oxidation.  Rapid oxidation, accompanied by a noticeable release  of heat and light, is called combustion or burning.  [Figure 1-3]  

# Classification of Fires  

For commercial purposes, the National Fire Protection  Association (NFPA) has classified fires into three basic types:  Class A, Class B, and Class C.  

1.	 Class A fires involve ordinary combustible materials,  such as wood, cloth, paper, upholstery materials, and  so forth. 2.	 Class B fires involve flammable petroleum products  or other flammable or combustible liquids, greases,  solvents, paints, and so forth. 3.	 Class C fires involve energized electrical wiring and  equipment.  

A fourth class of fire, the Class D fire, involves flammable  metal. Class D fires are not commercially considered by  the NFPA to be a basic type of fire since they are caused  by a Class A, B, or C fire. Usually Class D fires involve  magnesium in the shop, or in aircraft wheels and brakes, or  are the result of improper welding operations.  

Any one of these fires can occur during maintenance on or  around, or operations involving aircraft. There is a particular  type of extinguisher that is most effective for each type of fire.  

# Types and Operation of Shop and Flight Line Fire  Extinguishers  

Water extinguishers are the best type to use on Class A fires.  Water has two effects on fire. It deprives fire of oxygen and  cools the material being burned.  

Since most petroleum products float on water, water-type fire  extinguishers are not recommended for Class B fires. Extreme  caution must be used when fighting electrical fires (Class C)  with water-type extinguishers. All electrical power must be  removed or shut off to the burning area. Additionally, residual  electricity in capacitors, coils, and so forth must be considered  to prevent severe injury or possibly death from electrical shock.  

Never use water-type fire extinguishers on Class D fires. The  cooling effect of water causes an explosive expansion of the  metal, because metals burn at extremely high temperatures.  

Water fire extinguishers are operated in a variety of ways.  Some are hand pumped, while others are pressurized. The  pressurized types of extinguishers may have a gas charge  stored in the container with the water, or it may contain a  “soda-acid” container where acid is spilled into a container  of soda inside the extinguisher. The chemical reaction of  the soda and the acid causes pressure to build inside the fire  extinguisher, forcing the water out.  

Carbon dioxide   $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$   extinguishers are used for Class A, B,  and C fires, extinguishing the fire by depriving it of oxygen.  [Figure  $I$  -4]  Additionally, like water-type extinguishers,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  cools the burning material. Never use  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   on Class D fires.  As with water extinguishers, the cooling effect of   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   on  the hot metal can cause explosive expansion of the metal.  

When using   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   fire extinguishers, all parts of the  extinguisher can become extremely cold, and remain so  for a short time after operation. Wear protective equipment  or take other precautions to prevent cold injury, such as  frostbite. Extreme caution must be used when operating  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  fire extinguishers in closed or confined areas. Not only can  the fire be deprived of oxygen, but so too can the operator.  

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   fire extinguishers generally use the self-expelling  method of operation. This means that the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   has sufficient  pressure at normal operating pressure to expel itself. This  

![](images/1cee4db59c3992a3b5d9cd143d6f94a3525b3d870cdcc8ef87b7818311fb794b.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.   Three elements of fire.  

pressure is held inside the container by some type of seal  or frangible disk that is broken or punctured by a firing  mechanism, usually a pin. This means that once the seal or  disk is broken, pressure in the container is released and the  fire extinguisher is spent, requiring replacement.  [Figure 1-5]  

Halogenated hydrocarbon extinguishers are most effective  on Class B and C fires. They can be used on Class A and D  fires, but they are less effective. Halogenated hydrocarbon,  commonly called Freon™ by the industry, are numbered  according to chemical formulas with Halon™ numbers.  

Carbon tetrachloride (Halon 104), chemical formula  $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$  ,  has an Underwriters Laboratory (UL) toxicity rating of 3. As  such, it is extremely toxic.  [Figure 1-6]  Hydrochloric acid  vapor, chlorine, and phosgene gas are produced whenever  carbon tetrachloride is used on ordinary fires. The amount of  phosgene gas is increased whenever carbon tetrachloride is  brought in direct contact with hot metal, certain chemicals,  or continuing electrical arcs. It is not approved for any fire  extinguishing use. Old containers of Halon 104 found in or  around shops or hangars should be disposed of in accordance  with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations  and local laws and ordinances.  

Methyl bromide (Halon 1001), chemical formula   $\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{Br},$  ,  is a liquefied gas with a UL toxicity rating of 2. It is very  toxic and corrosive to aluminum alloys, magnesium, and  zinc. Halon 1001 is not recommended for aircraft use.  Chlo rob romo methane (Halon 1011), chemical formula 

  $\mathrm{CH}_{2}\mathrm{ClBr}$  , is a liquefied gas with a UL toxicity rating of 

 3. Like methyl bromide, Halon 1011 is not recommended for aircraft use. Di bro modi flu oro methane (Halon 1202), chemical formula  $\mathrm{CBr}_{2}\mathrm{F}_{2}$  , has a UL toxicity rating of 4. Halon 1202 is not recommended for aircraft use.  

B romo chlo rod i flu oro methane (Halon 1211), chemical formula   $\mathrm{CBrClF}_{2}$  , is a liquefied gas with a UL toxicity rating of 5. It  is colorless, noncorrosive, and evaporates rapidly leaving no  residue. It does not freeze or cause cold burns and does not  harm fabrics, metals, or other materials it contacts. Halon 1211  acts rapidly on fires by producing a heavy blanketing mist that  eliminates oxygen from the fire source. More importantly, it  interferes chemically with the combustion process of the fire.  Furthermore, it has outstanding properties in preventing re- flash after the fire has been extinguished.  

B romo tri flu oro methane (Halon 1301), chemical formula 

  $\mathrm{CF}_{3}\mathrm{Br},$  , is also a liquefied gas and has a UL toxicity rating of 

 6. It has all the characteristics of Halon 1211. The significant  difference between the two is Halon 1211 forms a spray similar to   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  , while Halon 1301 has a vapor spray that is more difficult to direct.  

Note:  The EPA has restricted Halon to its 1986 production  level due to its effect on the ozone layer.  

Dry powder extinguishers, while effective on Class B and  C fires, are best for use on Class D fires. The method of  operation of dry powder fire extinguishers varies from gas  cartridge charges, stored pressure within the container that  forces the powder charge out of the container, to scooping  pails or buckets of the powder from large containers or barrels  to toss on the fire.  

![](images/9bc0ae0be6514445634811489e1ae9da3548a9c5309891f5f13f896a9f923e2c.jpg)  
Figure 1-4.   Carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.  

Dry powder is not recommended for aircraft use, except  on metal fires, as a fire extinguisher. The leftover chemical  residues and dust often make cleanup difficult and can  damage electronic or other delicate equipment.  

# Inspection of Fire Extinguishers  

Fire extinguishers need to be checked periodically utilizing  a checklist. If a checklist is unavailable, check the following  as a minimum:  

•	 Proper location of appropriate extinguisher  

•	 Safety seals unbroken •	 All external dirt and rust removed •	 Gauge or indicator in operable range •	 Proper weight •	 No nozzle obstruction •	 No obvious damage  

Airport or other local fire departments can usually help in  preparing or providing extinguisher checklists. In addition,  these fire departments can be helpful in answering questions  

![Figure 1-5.   Extinguisher operation and methods of expelling. ](images/e2f108b16be44742259422fe4dd29a991336a64f25986f89f7b586f7fd3e5d55.jpg)  
 $^+$   Smaller sizes of these extinguishers are not recognized for use on these classes of fire.

and assisting in obtaining repairs to or replacement of fire  extinguishers.  

# Identifying Fire Extinguishers  

Fire extinguishers are marked to indicate suitability for a  particular class of fire. The markings on  Figure 1-7  must be  placed on the fire extinguisher and in a conspicuous place  in the vicinity of the fire extinguisher. When the location is  marked, however, take extreme care to ensure that the fire  extinguisher kept at that location is in fact the type depicted  by the marking. In other words, if a location is marked for a  Class B fire extinguisher, ensure that the fire extinguisher in  that location is in fact suitable for Class B fires.  

Markings must be applied by decalcomanias (decals),  painting, or similar methods. They are to be legible and as  durable as necessary for the location. For example, markings  used outside need to be more durable than those in the hangar  or office spaces.  

When markings are applied to the extinguisher, they are placed  on the front of the shell, if one is installed, above or below the  extinguisher nameplate. Markings must be large enough and  in a form that is easily seen and identifiable by the average  person with average eyesight at a distance of at least 3 feet.  

When markings are applied to wall panels, and so forth, in  the vicinity of extinguishers, they must be large enough and  in a form that is easily seen and identifiable by the average  person with average eyesight at a distance of at least 25 feet.  [Figure 1-8]  

# Using Fire Extinguishers  

When using a fire extinguisher, ensure the correct type is  used for the fire. Most extinguishers have a pin to pull that  allows the handle to activate the agent. Stand back 8 feet and  aim at the base of the fire or flames. Squeeze the lever and  sweep side to side until the fire is extinguished.  

# Tie-Down Procedures  

# Preparation of Aircraft  

Aircraft are to be tied down after each flight to prevent  damage from sudden storms. The direction that aircraft are  to be parked and tied down is determined by prevailing or  forecast wind direction.  

Aircraft are to be headed into the wind, depending on  the locations of the parking area’s fixed tie-down points.  Spacing of tie-downs need to allow for ample wingtip  clearance.  [Figure 1-9]  After the aircraft is properly  located, lock the nosewheel or the tail wheel in the  fore-and-aft position.  

# Tie-Down Procedures for Land Planes Securing Light Aircraft  

Light aircraft are most often secured with ropes tied only at  the aircraft tie-down rings provided for securing purposes.  Rope is never to be tied to a lift strut, since this practice can  bend a strut if the rope slips to a point where there is no slack.  Since manila rope shrinks when wet, about 1 inch (1") of  slack needs to be provided for movement. Too much slack,  however, allows the aircraft to jerk against the ropes. Tight  tie-down ropes put inverted flight stresses on the aircraft and  many are not designed to take such loads.  

A tie-down rope holds no better than the knot. Anti-slip knots,  such as the bowline, are quickly tied and are easy to untie.  [Figure 1-10]  Aircraft not equipped with tie-down fittings  must be secured in accordance with the manufacturer’s  instructions. Ropes are to be tied to outer ends of struts on  high-wing monoplanes and suitable rings provided where  structural conditions permit, if the manufacturer has not  already provided them.  

# Securing Heavy Aircraft  

The normal tie-down procedure for heavy aircraft can be  accomplished with rope or cable tie-down. The number of  tie-downs are governed by anticipated weather conditions.  

Most heavy aircraft are equipped with surface control locks  that are engaged or installed when the aircraft is secured.  Since the method of locking controls vary on different  types of aircraft, check the manufacturer’s instructions for  proper installation or engaging procedures. If high winds  are anticipated, control surface battens can also be installed  to prevent damage.  Figure 1-11  illustrates four common tie- down points on heavy aircraft.  

The normal tie-down procedure for heavy aircraft includes  the following:  

1.	 Head aircraft into prevailing wind whenever possible. 2.	 Install control locks, all covers, and guards. 3.	 Chock all wheels fore and aft.  [Figure 1-12] 4.	 Attach tie-down reels to aircraft tie-down loops, tie- down anchors, or tie-down stakes. Use tie-down stakes  for temporary tie-down only. If tie-down reels are not  available,   $\%"$   wire cable or   $1\%"$   manila line may be  used.  

# Tie-Down Procedures for Seaplanes  

Seaplanes can be moored to a buoy, weather permitting, or  tied to a dock. Weather causes wave action, and waves cause  the seaplane to bob and roll. This bobbing and rolling while  

![](images/e4b3503d22847ffad4845129f0033f178a79e53b913df4f7dddc2ef1dbb73da8.jpg)  
Figure 1-7.   Typical extinguisher markings.  

tied to a dock can cause damage.  

When warning of an impending storm is received and it is  not possible to fly the aircraft out of the storm area, some  compartments of the seaplane can be flooded, partially  sinking the aircraft. Tie down the aircraft securely to anchors.  Seaplanes tied down on land have been saved from high-wind  damage by filling the floats with water in addition to tying  the aircraft down in the usual manner. During heavy weather,  if possible, remove the seaplane from the water and tie down  in the same manner as a land plane. If this is not possible, the  seaplane could be anchored in a sheltered area away from  the wind and waves.  

![](images/91a20b32e56997b6c267627826a2ec8f2c9d84835d09e2baf65f717579295d5c.jpg)

Figure 1-9.   Diagram of tiedown dimensions.  

# Tie-Down Procedures for Ski Planes  

Ski planes are tied down, if the securing means are available,  in the same manner as land planes. Ski-equipped airplanes  can be secured on ice or in snow by using a device called a  dead-man. A dead-man is any item at hand, such as a piece  of pipe, log, and so forth, that a rope is attached to and buried  in a snow or ice trench. Using caution to keep the free end  of the rope dry and unfrozen, snow is packed in the trench.  If available, pour water into the trench; when it is frozen, tie  down the aircraft with the free end of the rope.  

Operators of ski-equipped aircraft sometimes pack soft snow  around the skis, pour water on the snow, and permit the skis  to freeze to the ice. This, in addition to the usual tie-down  procedures, aids in preventing damage from windstorms.  Caution must be used when moving an aircraft that has been  secured in this manner to ensure that a ski is not still frozen to  the ground. Otherwise, damage to the aircraft or skis can occur.  

# Tie-Down Procedures for Helicopters  

Helicopters, like other aircraft are secured to prevent structural  damage that can occur from high-velocity surface winds.  Helicopters are to be secured in hangars, when possible. If not,  they must be tied down securely. Helicopters that are tied down  can usually sustain winds up to approximately 65 mph. If at all  possible, helicopters are evacuated to a safe area if tornadoes  or hurricanes are anticipated. For added protection, helicopters  can be moved to a clear area so that they are not damaged by  flying objects or falling limbs from surrounding trees.  

If high winds are anticipated with the helicopter parked in the  open, tie down the main rotor blades. Detailed instructions for  securing and mooring each type of helicopter can be found in  the applicable maintenance manual.  [Figure 1-13]  Methods  of securing helicopters vary with weather conditions, the  

![](images/45c865ec0a5487f97ba6deb2104063abbe9a8d0fba94feee6e179642425b58f2.jpg)

to secure helicopters. Typical mooring procedures are as follows:  

1.	 Face the helicopter in the direction that the highest  forecast wind or gusts are anticipated. 2.	 Spot the helicopter slightly more than one rotor span  distance from other aircraft. 3.	 Place wheel chocks ahead of and behind all wheels  (where applicable). On helicopters equipped with  skids, retract the ground handling wheels, lower  the helicopter to rest on the skids, and install wheel  position lock pins or remove the ground-handling  wheels. Secure ground-handling wheels inside the  aircraft or inside the hangar or storage buildings. Do  not leave them unsecured on the flight line. 4.	 Align the blades and install tie-down assemblies  as prescribed by the helicopter manufacturer.  [Figure 1-14]  Tie straps snugly without strain, and  during wet weather, provide some slack to avoid the  possibility of the straps shrinking, causing undue stress  on the aircraft and/or its rotor system(s). 5.	 Fasten the tie-down ropes or cables to the forward  and aft landing gear cross tubes and secure to ground  stakes or tie-down rings.  

# Procedures for Securing Weight-Shift-Control  

There are many types of weight-shift-controlled aircraft— engine powered and non-powered. These types of aircraft are  very susceptible to wind damage. The wings can be secured  in a similar manner as a conventional aircraft in light winds.  In high winds, the mast can be disconnected from the wing  and the wing placed close to the ground and secured. This  type of aircraft can also be partially disassembled or moved  into a hangar for protection.  

# Procedures for Securing Powered Parachutes  

When securing powered parachutes, pack the parachute in a  bag to prevent the chute from filling with air from the wind  and dragging the seat and engine. The engine and seat can  also be secured if needed.  

# Ground Movement of Aircraft  

# Engine Starting and Operation  

The following instructions cover the starting procedures  for reciprocating, turboprop, turbofan, and APU. These  procedures are presented only as a general guide for  familiarization with typical procedures and methods. Detailed  instructions for starting a specific type of engine can be found  in the manufacturer’s instruction book.  

Before starting an aircraft engine:  

1.	 Position the aircraft to head into the prevailing wind  to ensure adequate airflow over the engine for cooling  purposes. 2.	 Make sure that no property damage or personal injury  occurs from the propeller blast or jet exhaust. 3.	 If external electrical power is used for starting, ensure  that it can be removed safely, and it is sufficient for  the total starting sequence.  4.	 During any and all starting procedures, a “fireguard”  equipped with a suitable fire extinguisher shall be  stationed in an appropriate place. A fireguard is  someone familiar with aircraft starting procedures.  The fire extinguisher should be a   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   extinguisher  of at least 5-pound capacity. The appropriate place is  adjacent to the outboard side of the engine, in view of  the pilot, and also where they can observe the engine/ aircraft for indication of starting problems. 5.	 If the aircraft is turbine-engine powered, the area in  front of the jet inlet must be kept clear of personnel,  property, and/or debris (FOD). 6.	 These “before starting” procedures apply to all aircraft  powerplants. 7.	 Follow manufacturer’s checklists for start procedures  and shutdown procedures.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

The following procedures are typical of those used to start  reciprocating engines. There are, however, wide variations  in the procedures for the many reciprocating engines. Do not  attempt to use the methods presented here for actually starting  an engine. Instead, always refer to the procedures contained  in the applicable manufacturer’s instructions. Reciprocating  engines are capable of starting in fairly low temperatures

without the use of engine heating or oil dilution, depending  on the grade of oil used.  

The various covers (wing, tail, flight deck, wheel, and  so forth) protecting the aircraft must be removed before  attempting to turn the engine. Use external sources of  electrical power when starting engines equipped with electric  starters, if possible or needed. This eliminates an excessive  burden on the aircraft battery. Leave all unnecessary electrical  equipment off until the generators are furnishing electrical  power to the aircraft power bus.  

Before starting a radial engine that has been shut down for  more than 30 minutes, check the ignition switch for off. Turn  the propeller three or four complete revolutions by hand to  detect a hydraulic lock, if one is present. Any liquid present  in a cylinder is indicated by the abnormal effort required to  rotate the propeller or by the propeller stopping abruptly  during rotation. Never use force to turn the propeller when  a hydraulic lock is detected. Sufficient force can be exerted  on the crankshaft to bend or break a connecting rod if a lock  is present.  

To eliminate a lock, remove either the front or rear spark  plug from the lower cylinders and pull the propeller through.  Never attempt to clear the hydraulic lock by pulling the  propeller through in the direction opposite to normal  rotation. This tends to inject the liquid from the cylinder into  the intake pipe. The liquid is drawn back into the cylinder  with the possibility of complete or partial lock occurring  on the subsequent start.  

To start the engine, proceed as follows:  

1.	 Turn the auxiliary fuel pump on, if the aircraft is  so equipped. 2.	 Place the mixture control to the position recommended  for the engine and carburetor combination being  started. As a general rule, put the mixture control in  the “idle cut-off” position for fuel injection and in the  

![](images/50f9c3b1110e8dcc4bfb1023ccd4ecaff74702418a84c1abcf0c93b3548b84eb.jpg)

“full rich” position for float-type carburetors. Many  light aircraft are equipped with a mixture control pull  rod that has no detent intermediate positions. When  such controls are pushed in flush with the instrument  panel, the mixture is set in the “full rich” position.  Conversely, when the control rod is pulled all the  way out, the carburetor is in the “idle cut-off” or “full  lean” position. The operator can select unmarked  intermediate positions between these two extremes  to achieve any desired mixture setting.  

$1{,}200\,\mathrm{rpm}$   (approximately  $\%"$   to  $\%"$   from the “closed”  position). 

 4.	 Leave the pre-heat or alternate air (carburetor air)  control in the “cold” position to prevent damage  and fire in case of backfire. These auxiliary heating  devices are used after the engine warms up. They  improve fuel vaporization, prevent fouling of the  spark plugs, ice formation, and eliminate icing in  the induction system.

 5.	 Move the primer switch to “on” intermittently (press  to prime by pushing in on the ignition switch during  the starting cycle), or prime with one to three strokes  of priming pump, depending on how the aircraft is  equipped. The colder the weather, the more priming  is needed. 

 6.	 Energize the starter and after the propeller has made  at least two complete revolutions, turn the ignition  switch on. On engines equipped with an induction  vibrator (shower of sparks, magneto incorporates a  retard breaker assembly), turn the switch to the “both”  position and energize the starter by turning the switch  to the “start” position. After the engine starts, release  the starter switch to the “both” position. When starting  an engine that uses an impulse coupling magneto,  turn the ignition switch to the “left” position. Place  the start switch to the “start” position. When the  engine starts, release the start switch. Do not crank  the engine continuously with the starter for more than  1 minute. Allow a 3- to 5-minute period for cooling  the starter (starter duty cycle) between successive  attempts. Otherwise, the starter may be burned out  due to overheating.

 7.	 After the engine is operating smoothly, move the  mixture control to the “full rich” position if started in the  “idle cutoff” position. Carbureted engines are already  in the rich mixture position. Check for oil pressure.

 8.	 Instruments for monitoring the engine during  operation include a tachometer for rpm, manifold  pressure gauge, oil pressure gauge, oil temperature  gauge, cylinder head temperature gauge, exhaust gas  

# Hand Cranking Engines  

If the aircraft has no self-starter, start the engine by turning the  propeller by hand (hand propping the propeller). The person  who is turning the propeller calls: “Fuel on, switch off, throttle  closed, brakes on.” The person operating the engine checks  these items and repeats the phrase. The switch and throttle must  not be touched again until the person swinging the prop calls  “contact.” The operator repeats “contact” and then turns on  the switch. Never turn on the switch and then call “contact.”  

A few simple precautions help to avoid accidents when hand  propping the engine. While touching a propeller, always  assume that the ignition is on. The switches that control the  magnetos operate on the principle of short-circuiting the  current to turn the ignition off. If the switch is faulty, it can  be in the “off” position and still permit current to flow in  the magneto primary circuit. This condition could allow the  engine to start when the switch is off.  

Be sure the ground is firm. Slippery grass, mud, grease, or loose  gravel can lead to a fall into or under the propeller. Never allow  any portion of your body to get in the way of the propeller. This  applies even when the engine is not being cranked.  

Stand close enough to the propeller to be able to step away  as it is pulled down. Stepping away after cranking is a  safeguard in case the brakes fail. Do not stand in a position  that requires leaning toward the propeller to reach it. This  throws the body off balance and could cause a fall into the  blades when the engine starts.  

In swinging the prop, always move the blade downward by  pushing with the palms of the hands. Do not grip the blade  with the fingers curled over the edge, since “kickback” may  break them or draw your body in the blade path. Excessive  throttle opening after the engine has fired is the principal  cause of backfiring during starting. Gradual opening of the  throttle, while the engine is cold, reduces the potential for  backfiring. Slow, smooth movement of the throttle assures  correct engine operation.  

Avoid over priming the engine before it is turned over by the  starter. This can result in fires, scored or scuffed cylinders  and pistons, or engine failures due to hydraulic lock. If the  engine is inadvertently flooded or over primed, turn the  ignition switch off and move the throttle to the “full open”  position. To rid the engine of the excess fuel, turn it over by  hand or by the starter. If excessive force is needed to turn  over the engine, stop immediately. Do not force rotation of  the engine. If in doubt, remove the lower cylinder spark plugs.  

Immediately after the engine starts, check the oil pressure  indicator. If oil pressure does not show within 30 seconds,  stop the engine and determine the trouble. If oil pressure is  indicated, adjust the throttle to the aircraft manufacturer’s  specified rpm for engine warm up. Warm up rpm is usually  between 1,000 to   $1{,}300\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

Most aircraft reciprocating engines are air cooled and  depend on the forward speed of the aircraft to maintain  proper cooling. Therefore, particular care is necessary when  operating these engines on the ground. During all ground  running, operate the engine with the propeller in full low  pitch and headed into the wind with the cowling installed to  provide the best degree of engine cooling. Closely monitor  the engine instruments at all times. Do not close the cowl  flaps for engine warm-up, they need to be in the open  position while operating on the ground. When warming up  the engine, ensure that personnel, ground equipment that may  be damaged, or other aircraft are not in the propeller wash.  

# Extinguishing Engine Fires  

In all cases, a fireguard should stand by with a   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   fire  extinguisher while the aircraft engine is being started. This  is a necessary precaution against fire during the starting  procedure. The fireguard must be familiar with the induction  system of the engine so that in case of fire, they can direct  the   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   into the air intake of the engine to extinguish it. A  fire could also occur in the exhaust system of the engine from  liquid fuel being ignited in the cylinder and expelled during  the normal rotation of the engine.  

If an engine fire develops during the starting procedure, the  operator should continue cranking to start the engine and  extinguish the fire. If the engine does not start and the fire  continues to burn, discontinue the start attempt. The fireguard  then extinguishes the fire using the available equipment. The  fireguard must observe all safety practices at all times while  standing by during the starting procedure.  

# Turboprop Engines  

The starting of any turbine engine consists of three steps that  must be carried out in the correct sequence. The starter turns  the main compressor to provide airflow though the engine. At  the correct speed that provides enough airflow, the igniters  are turned on and provide a hot spark to light the fuel that  is engaged next. As the engine accelerates, it reaches a self- sustaining speed and the starter is disengaged.  

The various covers protecting the aircraft must be removed.  Carefully inspect the engine exhaust areas for the presence  of fuel or oil. Make a close visual inspection of all accessible  parts of the engines and engine controls, followed by an  inspection of all nacelle areas to determine that all inspection  and access plates are secured. Check sumps for water. Inspect  air inlet areas for general condition and foreign material.  Check the compressor for free rotation, when the installation  permits, by reaching in and turning the blades by hand.  

The following procedures are typical of those used to start  turboprop engines. There are, however, wide variations in  the procedures applicable to the many turboprop engines.  Therefore, do not attempt to use these procedures in the actual  starting of a turboprop engine. These procedures are presented  only as a general guide for familiarization with typical  procedures and methods. For starting of all turboprop engines,  refer to the detailed procedures contained in the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions or their approved equivalent.  

Turboprop engines are usually fixed turbine or free turbine.  The propeller is connected to the engine directly in a fixed  turbine, resulting in the propeller being turned as the engine  starts. This provides extra drag that must be overcome during  starting. If the propeller is not at the “start” position, difficulty  may be encountered in making a start due to high loads. The  propeller is in flat pitch at shut down and subsequently in flat  pitch during start because of this.  

The free turbine engine has no mechanical connection  between the gas generator and the power turbine that is  connected to the propeller. In this type of engine, the propeller  remains in the feather position during starting and only turns  as the gas generator accelerates.  

Instrumentation for turbine engines varies according to the  type of turbine engine. Turboprop engines use the normal  instruments—oil pressure, oil temperature, inter-turbine  temperature (ITT), and fuel flow. They also use instruments  to measure gas generator speed, propeller speed, and torque  produced by the propeller.  [Figure 1-15]  A typical turboprop  uses a set of engine controls, such as power levelers (throttle),  propeller levers, and condition levers.  [Figure 1-16]  

The first step in starting a turbine engine is to provide an  adequate source of power for the starter. On smaller turbine  engines, the starter is an electric motor that turns the engine  through electrical power. Larger engines need a much  more powerful starter. Electric motors would be limited by  current flow and weight. Air turbine starters were developed  that were lighter and produced sufficient power to turn the  engine at the correct speed for starting. When an air turbine  starter is used, the starting air supply may be obtained from  an APU onboard the aircraft, an external source (ground air  cart), or an engine cross-bleed operation. In some limited  cases, a low-pressure, large-volume tank can provide the air  for starting an engine. Many smaller turboprop engines are  started using the starter/generator, that is both the engine  While starting an engine, always observe the following:  

•	 Always observe the starter duty cycle. Otherwise, the  starter can overheat and be damaged.  •	 Assure that there is enough air pressure or electrical  capacity before attempting a start. •	 Do not perform a ground start if turbine inlet  temperature (residual temperature) is above that  specified by the manufacturer. •	 Provide fuel under low pressure to the engine’s fuel  pump.  

# Turboprop Starting Procedures  

To start an engine on the ground, perform the following  operations:  

1.	 Turn the aircraft boost pumps on. 2.	 Make sure that the power lever is in the “start”  position. 3.	 Place the start switch in the “start” position. This starts  the engine turning. 4.	 Place the ignition switch on. (On some engines, the  ignition is activated by moving the fuel lever.)  5.	 The fuel is now turned on. This is accomplished by  moving the condition lever to the “on” position. 6.	 Monitor the engine lights of the exhaust temperature.  If it exceeds the limits, shut the engine down.  7.	 Check the oil pressure and temperature.  8.	 After the engine reaches a self-sustaining speed, the  starter is disengaged. 9.	 The engine continues to accelerate up to idle.  10.	 Maintain the power lever at the “start” position until  the specified minimum oil temperature is reached. 11.	 Disconnect the ground power supply, if used.  

If any of the following conditions occur during the starting  sequence, turn off the fuel and ignition switch, discontinue  the start immediately, make an investigation, and record  the findings.  

•	Turbine inlet temperature exceeds the specified maximum. Record the observed peak temperature. •	 Acceleration time from start of propeller rotation to  stabilized rpm exceeds the specified time. •	 There is no oil pressure indication at   $5{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$   for  either the reduction gear or the power unit. •	 Torching (visible burning in the exhaust nozzle).  

•	 The engine fails to ignite by  $4{,}500\,\mathrm{rpm}$   or maximum  motoring rpm. •	 Abnormal vibration is noted or compressor surge  occurs (indicated by backfiring).  •	 Fire warning bell rings. (This may be due to either an  engine fire or overheat.)  

# Turbofan Engines  

Unlike reciprocating engine aircraft, the turbine-powered  aircraft does not require a preflight run-up unless it is  necessary to investigate a suspected malfunction.  

Before starting, all protective covers and air inlet duct covers  are removed. If possible, head the aircraft into the wind to  obtain better cooling, faster starting, and smoother engine  performance. It is especially important that the aircraft be  headed into the wind if the engine is to be trimmed.  

The run-up area around the aircraft is cleared of both  personnel and loose equipment. The turbofan engine intake  and exhaust hazard areas are illustrated in  Figure 1-17 .  Exercise care to ensure that the run-up area is clear of all  items, such as nuts, bolts, rocks, shop towels, or other loose  debris. Many very serious accidents have occurred involving  personnel in the vicinity of turbine engine air inlets. Use  extreme caution when starting turbine aircraft.  

Check the aircraft fuel sumps for water or ice. Inspect the  engine air inlet for general condition and the presence of  foreign objects. Visually inspect the fan blades, forward  compressor blades, and the compressor inlet guide vanes for  nicks and other damage. If possible, check the fan blades for  free rotation by turning the fan blades by hand. All engine  controls must be operational. Check engine instruments and  warning lights for proper operation.  

# Starting a Turbofan Engine  

The following procedures are typical of those used to start  many turbine engines. There are, however, wide variations  in the starting procedures used for turbine engines, and no  attempts are to be made to use these procedures in the actual  starting of an engine. These procedures are presented only as  a general guide for familiarization with typical procedures  and methods. In the starting of all turbine engines, refer  to the detailed procedures contained in the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions or their approved equivalent.  

Most turbofan engines can be started by either air turbine  or electrical starters. Air-turbine starters use compressed air  from an external source as discussed earlier. Fuel is turned on  either by moving the start lever to “idle/start” position or by  opening a fuel shutoff valve. If an air turbine starter is used,  

![](images/36aef4623af097441bc3ba8518958bf1728dcfd949d1ea7320ab4550b9a2d64a.jpg)

Figure 1-16.   Engine controls of a turboprop aircraft.  

the engine “lights off” within a predetermined time after the  fuel is turned on. This time interval, if exceeded, indicates a  malfunction has occurred and the start must be discontinued.  

Most turbofan engine controls consist of a power lever,  reversing levers, and start levers. Newer aircraft have replaced  the start levers with a fuel switch.  [Figure 1-18]  Turbofan  engines also use all the normal instruments speeds, (percent  of total rpm) exhaust gas temperature, fuel flow, oil pressure,  and temperature. An instrument that measures the amount  of thrust being delivered is the engine pressure ratio. This  measures the ratio between the inlet pressures to the outlet  pressure of the turbine.  

The following procedures are useful only as a general guide  and are included to show the sequence of events in starting  a turbofan engine.  

1.	 If the engine is so equipped, place the power lever in  the “idle” position. 2.	 Turn the fuel boost pump(s) switch on. 3.	 A fuel inlet pressure indicator reading ensures fuel is  being delivered to engine fuel pump inlet. 4.	 Turn engine starter switch on. Note that the engine  rotates to a preset limit. Check for oil pressure. 5.	 Turn ignition switch on. (This is usually accomplished  by moving the start lever toward the “on” position.  A micro switch connected to the leveler turns on the  ignition.) 6.	 Move the start lever to “idle” or “start” position, this  starts fuel flow into the engine.  7.	 Engine start (light off) is indicated by a rise in exhaust  gas temperature. 8.	 If a two-spool engine, check rotation of fan or N1. 9.	 Check for proper oil pressure. 10.	 Turn engine starter switch off at proper speeds. 11.	 After engine stabilizes at idle, ensure that none of the  engine limits are exceeded. 12.	 Newer aircraft drop off the starter automatically.  

# Auxiliary Power Units (APUs)  

APUs are generally smaller turbine engines that provide  compressed air for starting engines, cabin heating and  cooling, and electrical power while on the ground. Their  operation is normally simple. By turning a switch on and  up to the start position (spring loaded to on position), the  engine starts automatically. During start, the exhaust gas  temperature must be monitored. APUs are at idle at 100  percent rpm with no load. After the engine reaches its  operating rpm, it can be used for cooling or heating the  cabin and for electrical power. It is normally used to start  the main engines.  

# Unsatisfactory Turbine Engine Starts  Hot Start  

A hot start occurs when the engine starts, but the exhaust  gas temperature exceeds specified limits. This is usually  caused by an excessively rich air-fuel mixture entering the  combustion chamber. This condition can be caused by either  too much fuel or not enough airflow. The fuel to the engine  must be shut off immediately.  

# False or Hung Start  

False or hung starts occur when the engine starts normally, but  the rpm remains at some low value rather than increasing to  the normal starting rpm. This is often the result of insufficient  power to the starter or the starter cutting off before the engine  starts self-accelerating. In this case, shut the engine down.  

# Engine Fails to Start  

The engine failing to start within the prescribed time limit  can be caused by lack of fuel to the engine, insufficient or  no electrical power to the exciter in the ignition system, or  incorrect fuel mixture. If the engine fails to start within the  prescribed time, shut it down.  

In all cases of unsatisfactory starts, the fuel and ignition must be  turned off. Continue rotating the compressor for approximately  15 seconds to remove accumulated fuel from the engine. If  unable to motor (rotate) the engine, allow a 30-second fuel  draining period before attempting another start.  

# Towing of Aircraft  

Movement of large aircraft about the airport, flight line,  and hangar is usually accomplished by towing with a tow  tractor (sometimes called a “tug”).  [Figure 1-19]  In the case  of small aircraft, some moving is accomplished by hand  pushing on the correct areas of the aircraft. Aircraft may also  be taxied about the flight line but usually only by certain  qualified personnel.  

Towing aircraft can be a hazardous operation, causing  damage to the aircraft and injury to personnel, if done  recklessly or carelessly. The following paragraphs outline  the general procedure for towing aircraft. However, specific  instructions for each model of aircraft are detailed in the  manufacturer’s maintenance instructions and are to be  followed in all instances.  

Before the aircraft to be towed is moved, a qualified person  must be in the flight deck to operate the brakes in case the  tow bar fails or becomes unhooked. The aircraft can then be  stopped, preventing possible damage.  

Some types of tow bars available for general use can be used  for many types of towing operations.  [Figure 1-20]  These  bars are designed with sufficient tensile strength to pull most  aircraft, but are not intended to be subjected to torsional or  twisting loads. Many have small wheels that permit them to be  drawn behind the towing vehicle going to or from an aircraft.  When the bar is attached to the aircraft, inspect all the engaging  devices for damage or malfunction before moving the aircraft.  Additionally, some aircraft have tow steering turn limits.  

Some tow bars are designed for towing various types of  aircraft. However, other special types can be used on a  particular aircraft only. Such bars are usually designed and  built by the aircraft manufacturer.  

When towing the aircraft, the towing vehicle speed must be  reasonable, and all persons involved in the operation must be  alert. When the aircraft is stopped, do not rely upon the brakes  of the towing vehicle alone to stop the aircraft. The person in  the flight deck must coordinate the use of the aircraft brakes  with those of the towing vehicle. A typical smaller aircraft  tow tractor (or tug) is shown in  Figure 1-21 .  

The attachment of the tow bar varies on different types of  aircraft. Aircraft equipped with tail wheels are generally  towed forward by attaching the tow bar to the main landing  gear. In most cases, it is permissible to tow the aircraft in  reverse by attaching the tow bar to the tail wheel axle. Any  time an aircraft equipped with a tail wheel is towed, the tail  wheel must be unlocked or the tail wheel locking mechanism  may damage or break. Aircraft equipped with tricycle landing  gear are generally towed forward by attaching a tow bar to the  axle of the nosewheel. They may also be towed forward or  backward by attaching a towing bridle or specially designed  towing bar to the towing lugs on the main landing gear. When  an aircraft is towed in this manner, a steering bar is attached  to the nosewheel to steer the aircraft.  

The following towing and parking procedures are typical of  one type of operation. They are examples and not necessarily  suited to every type of operation. Aircraft ground-handling  personnel must be thoroughly familiar with all procedures  pertaining to the types of aircraft being towed and local  operation standards governing ground handling of aircraft.  Competent persons that have been properly checked out  direct the aircraft towing team.  

1.	 The towing vehicle driver is responsible for operating  the vehicle in a safe manner and obeying emergency  stop instructions given by any team member.  

2.	 The person in charge assigns team personnel as wing  walkers. A wing walker is stationed at each wingtip, in  such a position that they can ensure adequate clearance  

![](images/837707373e285544aa31491992493c960bf50e85416a3b2443a81ea0fb090b78.jpg)

of any obstruction in the path of the aircraft. A tail  walker is assigned when sharp turns are to be made  or when the aircraft is to be backed into position.  

3.	 A qualified person occupies the pilot’s seat of the towed  aircraft to observe and operate the brakes as required.  When necessary, another qualified person is stationed to  watch and maintain aircraft hydraulic system pressure.  

4.	 The person in charge of the towing operation verifies  that, on aircraft with a steerable nosewheel, the  locking scissors are set to full swivel for towing. The  locking device must be reset after the tow bar has  been removed from the aircraft. Persons stationed  in the aircraft are not to attempt to steer or turn the  nosewheel when the tow bar is attached to the aircraft.  

5.	 Under no circumstances is anyone permitted to walk  or to ride between the nosewheel of an aircraft and the  towing vehicle, nor ride on the outside of a moving  aircraft or on the towing vehicle. In the interest of  safety, no attempt to board or leave a moving aircraft  or towing vehicle is permitted.  

6.	 The towing speed of the aircraft is not to exceed that  of the walking team members. The aircraft’s engines  usually are not operated when the aircraft is being

# towed into position.  

7.	 The aircraft brake system is to be charged before each  towing operation. Aircraft with faulty brakes are towed  into position only for repair of brake systems, and then  personnel must be standing by ready with chocks for  emergency use. Chocks must be immediately available  in case of an emergency throughout any towing  operation. 8.	 To avoid possible personal injury and aircraft damage  during towing operations, entrance doors are closed,  ladders retracted, and gear-down locks installed. 9.	 Prior to towing any aircraft, check all tires and landing  gear struts for proper inflation. (Inflation of landing gear  struts of aircraft in overhaul and storage is excluded.) 10.	 When moving aircraft, do not start and stop suddenly.  For added safety, aircraft brakes must never be applied  during towing, except upon command by one of the  tow team members in an emergency situation. 11.	 Aircraft are parked in specified areas. Generally,  the distance between rows of parked aircraft is great  enough to allow immediate access of emergency  vehicles in case of fire, as well as free movement of  equipment and materials. 12.	 Wheel chocks are placed fore and aft of the main  landing gear of the parked aircraft. 13.	 Internal or external control locks (gust locks or blocks)  are used while the aircraft is parked. 14.	 Prior to any movement of aircraft across runways  or taxiways, contact the airport control tower on the  appropriate frequency for clearance to proceed. 15.	 An aircraft parked in a hangar must be statically  grounded immediately.  

# Taxiing Aircraft  

As a general rule, only rated pilots and qualified airframe  and powerplant (A&P) technicians are authorized to  start, run up, and taxi aircraft. All taxiing operations are  

![](images/d70d5473b4bbf3cf76138709ae852f72c6d91b983b6879d0cf547edcb460e415.jpg)

performed in accordance with applicable local regulations.  Figure 1-22  contains the standard taxi light signals used by  control towers to control and expedite the taxiing of aircraft.  The following section provides detailed instructions on taxi  signals and related taxi instructions.  

# Taxi Signals  

Many ground accidents have occurred as a result of improper  technique in taxiing aircraft. Although the pilot is ultimately  responsible for the aircraft until the engine is stopped, a  taxi signalman can assist the pilot around the flight line. In  some aircraft configurations, the pilot’s vision is obstructed  while on the ground. The pilot cannot see obstructions close  to the wheels or under the wings and has little idea of what  is behind the aircraft. Consequently, the pilot depends upon  the taxi signalman for directions.  Figure 1-23  shows a taxi  signalman indicating his readiness to assume guidance of  the aircraft by extending both arms at full length above his  head, palms facing each other.  

The standard position for a signalman is slightly ahead of  and in line with the aircraft’s left wingtip. As the signalman  faces the aircraft, the nose of the aircraft is on the left.  [Figure 1-24]  The signalman must stay far enough ahead  of the wingtip to remain in the pilot’s field of vision. It is a  good practice to perform a foolproof test to be sure the pilot  can see all signals. If the signalman can see the pilot’s eyes,  the pilot can see the signals.  

Figure   $_{l-24}$   shows the standard aircraft taxiing signals  published in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). There are other  standard signals, such as those published in Advisory Circular  00-34, as revised, and by the International Standards (ICAO)  Annex 2, Appendix 1 and the Armed Forces. Furthermore,  operation conditions in many areas may call for a modified  set of taxi signals. The signals shown in  Figure 1-24  represent  a minimum number of the most commonly used signals.  Whether this set of signals or a modified set is used is not  the most important consideration, as long as each flight  operational center uses a suitable, agreed-upon set of signals.  Figure 1-25  illustrates some of the most commonly used  helicopter operating signals.  

The taxi signals to be used must be studied until the taxi  signalman can execute them clearly and precisely. The signals  are to be given in such a way that the pilot cannot confuse  their meaning. Remember that the pilot receiving the signals  is always some distance away and often look out and down  from a difficult angle. Thus, the signalman’s hands must be  kept well separated, and signals are to be over-exaggerated  rather than risk making indistinct signals. If there is any  doubt about a signal, or if the pilot does not appear to be  following the signals, use the “stop” sign and begin the series  of signals again.  

The signalman is to always try to give the pilot an indication  of the approximate area that the aircraft is to be parked.  The signalman must glance behind himself or herself often  when walking backward to prevent backing into a propeller  or tripping over a chock, fire bottle, tie-down line, or  other obstruction.  

Taxi signals are usually given at night with the aid of  illuminated wands attached to flashlights.  [Figure 1-26]  Night  signals are made in the same manner as day signals with the  exception of the stop signal. The stop signal used at night is  the “emergence stop” signal. This signal is made by crossing  the wands to form a lighted “X” above and in front of the head.  

# Servicing Aircraft  

# Servicing Aircraft Air/Nitrogen Oil & Fluids  

Checking or servicing aircraft fluids is an important  maintenance function. Before servicing any aircraft, consult  the specific aircraft maintenance manual to determine the  proper type of servicing equipment and procedures. In  general, aircraft engine oil is checked with a dipstick or a sight  gauge. There are markings on the stick or around the sight  gauge to determine the correct level. Reciprocating engines  are to be checked after the engine has been inactive, while  the turbine engine must be checked just after shutdown. Dry  sump oil systems tend to hide oil that has seeped from the oil  tank into the gearcase of the engine. This oil does not show up  on the dipstick until the engine has been started or motored.  If serviced before this oil is pumped back into the tank, the  engine overfills. Never overfill the oil tank. Oil foams as it  is circulated through the engine. The expansion space in the  oil tank allows for this foaming (oil mixing with air). Also  the correct type of oil must be used for the appropriate engine  being serviced. Hydraulic fluid, fuel, and oil, if spilled on  clothes or skin, must be removed as soon as possible because  When servicing a hydraulic reservoir, the correct fluid must  be used. Normally, this can be determined by the container  or by color. Some reservoirs are pressurized by air that must  be bled off before servicing. Efforts must be made to prevent  any type of contamination during servicing. Also, if changing  hydraulic filters, assure that the pressure is off the system  before removing the filters. After servicing the filters (if large  amounts of fluids were lost) or system quantity, air must be  purged and the system checked for leaks. While servicing  tires or struts with high-pressure nitrogen, the technician  must use caution while performing maintenance. Clean areas  before connecting filling hose and do not overinflate.  

# Ground Support Equipment  Electric Ground Power Units  

Ground support electrical APUs vary widely in size and  type. However, they can be generally classified by towed,  stationary, or self-propelled items of equipment. Some units  are mainly for in-hangar use during maintenance. Others are  designed for use on the flight line, either at a stationary gate  area or towed from aircraft to aircraft. The stationary type  can be powered from the electrical service of the facility.  The movable type ground power unit (GPU) generally has  an onboard engine that turns a generator to produce power.  Some smaller units use a series of batteries. The towed power  units vary in size and range of available power.  

The smallest units are simply high-capacity batteries used  to start light aircraft. These units are normally mounted on  wheels or skids and are equipped with an extra-long electrical  line terminated in a suitable plug-in adapter.  

Larger units are equipped with generators. Providing a  wider range of output power, these power units are normally  designed to supply constant-current, variable voltage DC  electrical power for starting turbine aircraft engines and  constant-voltage DC for starting reciprocating aircraft  engines. Normally somewhat top-heavy, large towed power  units are towed at restricted speeds, and sharp turns are  avoided. An example of a large power unit is shown in  

![Figure 1-22.   Standard taxi light signals. ](images/57834f088e0af5d57ec8f60db9a7520190ab0d2ebb22655ef2e02f13527d68f4.jpg)

Figure 1-23.   The taxi signalman.  

Self-propelled power units are normally more expensive than  the towed units and, in most instances, supply a wider range  of output voltages and frequencies. The stationary power unit,  shown in  Figure 1-28,  is capable of supplying DC power in  varying amounts, as well as 115/200-volt, 3-phase, 400-cycle  AC power continuously for 5 minutes.  

When using ground electrical power units, it is important to  position the unit to prevent collision with the aircraft being  serviced, or others nearby, in the event the brakes on the unit  fail. It must be parked so that the service cable is extended  to near its full length away from the aircraft being serviced,  but not so far that the cable is stretched or undue stress is  placed on the aircraft electrical receptacle.  

Observe all electrical safety precautions when servicing an  aircraft. Additionally, never move a power unit when service  cables are attached to an aircraft or when the generator  system is engaged.  

![](images/c837263a9a2eb94e7bdc2a830efd7bab47f05e4438f88f02a2bb236cfa53c085.jpg)

# Hydraulic Ground Power Units  

Portable hydraulic test stands are manufactured in many sizes  and cost ranges.  [Figure 1-29]  Some have a limited range of  operation, while others can be used to perform all the system  tests that fixed-shop test stands are designed to perform.  Hydraulic power units, sometimes called a hydraulic mule,  provide hydraulic pressure to operate the aircraft systems  during maintenance. They can be used to:  

•	 Drain the aircraft hydraulic systems. •	 Filter the aircraft hydraulic system fluid. •	 Refill the aircraft hydraulic system with clean fluid. •	 Check the aircraft hydraulic systems for operation  and leaks.  

This type of portable hydraulic test unit is usually an  electrically-powered unit. It uses a hydraulic system  

![](images/61a6a78fffa0d428c9388e2393f98f842cd8b8461ef4e7f6edace9ae41b1ae2c.jpg)  
Figure 1-25.   Helicopter operating signals.  

capable of delivering a variable volume of fluid from zero  to approximately 24 gallons per minute at variable pressures  up to 3,000 psi.  

Operating at pressures of 3,000 psi or more, extreme caution  must be used when operating hydraulic power units. At 3,000  psi, a small stream from a leak can cut like a sharp knife.  Therefore, inspect lines used with the system for cuts, frays,  or any other damage, and keep them free of kinks and twists.  When not in use, hydraulic power unit lines are to be stored  (preferably wound on a reel) and kept clean, dry, and free  of contaminants.  

# Ground Support Air Units  

Air carts are used to provide low-pressure (up to 50 psi high  volume flow) air that can be used for starting the engines  and heating and cooling the aircraft on the ground (using the  onboard aircraft systems). It generally consists of an APU  

![](images/f89d3003cdbd567de22f9f1b492f5035794037df1f2731b2867165f29dc77a42.jpg)  
Figure 1-26.   Night operations with wands.  

built into the cart that provides bleed air from the APU’s  compressor for operating aircraft systems or starting engines.  [Figure 1-30]  

# Ground Air Heating and Air Conditioning  

Most airport gates have facilities that can provide heated or  cooled air. The units that cool or heat the air are permanent  installations that connect to the aircraft’s ventilation  system by use of a large hose. Portable heating and air  conditioning units can also be moved close to the aircraft  and connected by a duct that provides air to keep the cabin  temperature comfortable.  

# Oxygen Servicing Equipment  

Before servicing any aircraft, consult the specific aircraft  maintenance manual to determine the proper types of  servicing equipment to be used. Two personnel are required  to service an aircraft with gaseous oxygen. One person is  stationed at the control valves of the servicing equipment, and  one person is stationed where they can observe the pressure in  the aircraft system. Communication between the two people  is required in the event of an emergency.  

Do not service aircraft with oxygen during fueling, defueling,  or other maintenance work that could provide a source of  ignition. Oxygen servicing of aircraft is to be accomplished  outside hangars.  

Oxygen used on aircraft is available in two types: gaseous and  liquid. The type to use on any specific aircraft depends on the  type of equipment in the aircraft. Gaseous oxygen is stored  in large steel cylinders, while liquid oxygen (commonly  referred to as LOX) is stored and converted into a usable gas  in a liquid oxygen converter.  

Oxygen is commercially available in three general types:  aviator’s breathing, industrial, and medical. Only oxygen  marked “Aviator’s Breathing Oxygen” that meets Federal  Specification BB-0-925A, Grade A, or its equivalent is to be  used in aircraft breathing oxygen systems. Industrial oxygen  may contain impurities that could cause the pilot, crew, and/ or passengers to become sick. Medical oxygen, although pure,  contains water that can freeze in the cold temperatures found  at the altitudes where oxygen is necessary.

# Oxygen Hazards  

Gaseous oxygen is chemically stable and is nonflammable.  However, combustible materials ignite more rapidly and  burn with greater intensity in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. In  addition, oxygen combines with oil, grease, or bituminous  material to form a highly-explosive mixture that is sensitive  to compression or impact. Physical damage to, or failure  of, oxygen containers, valves, or plumbing can result in an  explosive rupture with extreme danger to life and property.  It is imperative that the highest standard of cleanliness be  observed in handling oxygen and that only qualified and  authorized persons be permitted to service aircraft gaseous  oxygen systems. In addition to aggravating the fire hazard  and because of its low temperature (it boils at   $-297\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ),  liquid oxygen causes severe “burns” (frostbite) if it comes  in contact with the skin.  

# Fuel Servicing of Aircraft  

# Types of Fuel and Identification  

Two types of aviation fuel in general use are aviation gasoline,  also known as AVGAS, and turbine fuel, also known as JET  A fuel.  

Aviation gasoline (AVGAS) is used in reciprocating engine  aircraft. Currently, there are three grades of fuel in general  use: 80/87, 100/130, and 100LL (low lead). A fourth grade,  115/145, is in limited use in the large reciprocating-engine  aircraft. The two numbers indicate the lean mixture and rich  mixture octane rating numbers of the specific fuel. In other  words, with 80/87 AVGAS, the 80 is the lean mixture rating  and 87 is the rich mixture rating number. To avoid confusing  the types of AVGAS, it is generally identified as grade 80,  

![](images/2d3a046fe6d04a6a74a44b71189d0df1eb84a3795d822dd231360f339361ba91.jpg)  
Figure 1-29.   A portable hydraulic power unit.  

100, 100LL, or 115. AVGAS can also be identified by a color  code. The color of the fuel needs to match the color band on  piping and fueling equipment.  [Figure 1-31]  

Turbine fuel/jet fuel is used to power turbojet and turbo- shaft engines. Three types of turbine fuel generally used  in civilian aviation are JET A and JET A-1, made from  kerosene, and JET B, a blend of kerosene and AVGAS.  While jet fuel is identified by the color black on piping and  fueling equipment, the actual color of jet fuel can be clear  or straw colored.  

Before mixing AVGAS and turbine fuel, refer to the Type  Certificate Data Sheet for the respective powerplant. Adding  jet fuel to AVGAS causes a decrease in the power developed  by the engine and could cause damage to the engine (through  detonation) and loss of life. Adding AVGAS to jet fuel can  cause lead deposits in the turbine engine and can lead to  reduced service life.  

# Contamination Control  

Contamination is anything in the fuel that is not supposed to  be there. The types of contamination found in aviation fuel  include water, solids, and microbial growths. The control of  contamination in aviation fuel is extremely important, since  contamination can lead to engine failure or stoppage and the  loss of life. The best method of controlling contamination  is to prevent its introduction into the fuel system. Some  forms of contamination can still occur inside the fuel system.  However, the filter, separators, and screens remove most of  the contamination.  

Water in aviation fuels generally take two forms: dissolved  (vapor) and free water. The dissolved water is not a major  problem until, as the temperature lowers, it becomes free  water. This then poses a problem if ice crystals form, clogging  filters and other small orifices.  

![](images/0812ec93ed4614c6f24a819fb5741b17b21d3da1578fb897dd997358a83a3184.jpg)  
Figure 1-30.   Aircraft air start unit.  

Free water can appear as water slugs or entrained water.  Water slugs are concentrations of water. This is the water  that is drained after fueling an aircraft. Entrained water is  suspended water droplets. These droplets may not be visible  to the eye but give the fuel a cloudy look. The entrained water  settles out in time.  

Solid contaminants are insoluble in fuel. The more common  types are rust, dirt, sand, gasket material, lint, and fragments  of shop towels. The close tolerances of fuel controls and  other fuel-related mechanisms can be damaged or blocked  by particles as small as  $\%$   the diameter of a human hair.  

Microbiological growths are a problem in jet fuel. There  are a number of varieties of micro-organisms that can  live in the free water in jet fuel. Some variations of these  organisms are airborne, others live in the soil. The aircraft  fuel system becomes susceptible to the introduction of  these organisms each time the aircraft is fueled. Favorable  conditions for the growth of micro-organisms in the fuel  are warm temperatures and the presence of iron oxide and  mineral salts in the water. The best way to prevent microbial  growth is to keep the fuel dry.  

The effects of micro-organisms are:  

•	 Formation of slime or sludge that can foul filters,  separators, or fuel controls. •	 Emulsification of the fuel. •	 Corrosive compounds that can attack the fuel tank’s  structure. In the case of a wet wing tank, the tank is  made from the aircraft’s structure. They can also have  offensive odors.  

# Fueling Hazards  

The volatility of aviation fuels creates a fire hazard that has  plagued aviators and aviation engine designers since the  beginning of powered flight. Volatility is the ability of a liquid  to change into a gas at a relatively low temperature. In its  liquid state, aviation fuel does not burn. It is, therefore, the  vapor or gaseous state that the liquid fuel changes that is not  only useful in powering the aircraft, but also a fire hazard.  

Static electricity is a byproduct of one substance rubbing  against another. Fuel flowing through a fuel line causes  a certain amount of static electricity. The greatest static  electricity concern around aircraft is that during flight, the  aircraft moving through the air causes static electricity to  build in the airframe. If that static electricity is not dissipated  prior to refueling, the static electricity in the airframe attempts  to return to the ground through the fuel line from the servicing  unit. The spark caused by the static electricity can ignite any  vaporized fuel.  

Breathing the vapors from fuel can be harmful and must  be limited. Any fuel spilled on the clothing or skin must be  removed as soon as possible.  

# Fueling Procedures  

The proper fueling of an aircraft is the responsibility of the  owner/operator. This does not, however, relieve the person  doing the fueling of the responsibility to use the correct type  of fuel and safe fueling procedures.  

There are two basic procedures when fueling an aircraft.  Smaller aircraft are fueled by the over-the-wing method.  This method uses the fuel hose to fill through fueling ports  on the top of the wing. The method used for larger aircraft is  the single point fueling system. This type of fueling system  uses receptacles in the bottom leading edge of the wing to  fill all the tanks. This decreases the time it takes to refuel  the aircraft, limits contamination, and reduces the chance  of static electricity igniting the fuel. Most pressure fueling  systems consist of a pressure fueling hose and a panel of  controls and gauges that permit one person to fuel or defuel  any or all fuel tanks of an aircraft. Each tank can be filled  to a predetermined level. These procedures are illustrated in  Figures 1-32  and    $_{l-33}$  .  

Prior to fueling, the person fueling must check the following:  

1.	 Ensure all aircraft electrical systems and electronic  devices, including radar, are turned off.  2.	 Do not carry anything in the shirt pockets. These items  could fall into the fuel tanks. 3.	 Ensure no flame-producing devices are carried by  anyone engaged in the fueling operation. A moment  of carelessness could cause an accident. 4.	 Ensure that the proper type and grade of fuel is used.  Do not mix AVGAS and JET fuel. 5.	 Ensure that all the sumps have been drained. 6.	 Wear eye protection. Although generally not as critical  as eye protection, other forms of protection, such as  rubber gloves and aprons, can also protect the skin  from the effects of spilled or splashed fuel.  

![Figure 1-31.   Aviation gasoline color and grade reference. ](images/481855d583de5bed7c7b259442675218d92afb6804b065830dd3255086f9234f.jpg)

Figure 1-32.   Refueling an aircraft by the over-the-wing method.  

7.	 Do not fuel aircraft if there is danger of other aircraft in  the vicinity blowing dirt in the direction of the aircraft  being fueled. Blown dirt, dust, or other contaminants  can enter an open fuel tank, contaminating the entire  contents of the tank. 

 8.	 Do not fuel an aircraft when there is lightning within  5 miles.

 9.	 Do not fuel an aircraft within 500 feet of operating  ground radar.  

When using mobile fueling equipment:  

1.	 Approach the aircraft with caution, positioning the  fuel truck so that if it is necessary to depart quickly,  no backing needed. 2.	 Set the hand brake of the fuel truck, and chock the  wheels to prevent rolling. 3.	 Ground the aircraft and then ground the truck. Next,  ground or bond them together by running a connecting  wire between the aircraft and the fuel truck. This may  be done by three separate ground wires or by a “Y”  

cable from the fuel truck.  

4.	 Ensure that the grounds are in contact with bare  metal or are in the proper grounding points on the  aircraft. Do not use the engine exhaust or propeller as  grounding points. Damage to the propeller can result,  and there is no way of quickly ensuring a positive bond  between the engine and the airframe.

 5.	 Ground the nozzle to the aircraft, then open the fuel  tank.

 6.	 Protect the wing and any other item on the aircraft from  damage caused by spilled fuel or careless handling of  the nozzle, hose, or grounding wires.

 7.	 Check the fuel cap for proper installation and security  before leaving the aircraft.

 8.	 Remove the grounding wires in the reverse order. If  the aircraft is not going to be flown or moved soon,  the aircraft ground wire can be left attached.  

is necessary to have a method of collecting the fuel. When  the pumping method is used, care must be taken not to  damage the tanks, and the removed fuel cannot be mixed  with good fuel.  

General precautions when defueling are:  

•	 Ground the aircraft and defueling equipment. •	 Turn off all electrical and electronic equipment. •	 Have the correct type of fire extinguisher available. •	 Wear eye protection.  

When fueling from pits or cabinets, follow the same  procedures as when using a truck. Pits or cabinets are usually  designed with permanent grounding, eliminating the need  to ground the equipment. However, the aircraft still must be  grounded, and then the equipment must be grounded to the  aircraft as it was with mobile equipment.  

# Defueling  

Defueling procedures differ with different types of aircraft.  Before defueling an aircraft, check the maintenance/service  manual for specific procedures and cautions. Defueling can  be accomplished by gravity defueling or by pumping the  fuel out of the tanks. When the gravity method is used, it

# Chapter 2 Regulations, Maintenance Forms,  Records, & Publications  

# Overview — Title 14 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (14  CFR)  

A viation-related regulations that have occurred from 1926– 1966 are reflected in  Figure 2-1 . Just as aircraft continue to  evolve with ever improving technology, so do the regulations,  publications, forms, and records required to design, build,  and maintain them.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that  govern today’s aircraft are found in Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  [Figure 2-2]  There are  five volumes under Title 14, Aeronautics and Space. The  first three volumes containing 75 active regulations address  the Federal Aviation Administration. The fourth volume  deals with the Office of the Secretary of the Department  of Transportation (Aviation Proceedings) and Commercial  Space Transportation, while the fifth volume addresses the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and  Air Transportation System Stabilization.  

These regulations can be separated into the following three  categories:  

1.	 Administrative 2.	 Airworthiness Certification 3.	 Airworthiness Operation  

Since 1958, these rules have typically been referred to as  “FARs,” short for Federal Aviation Regulations. However,  another set of regulations, Title 48, is titled “Federal  Acquisitions Regulations,” and this has led to confusion  with the use of the acronym “FAR.” Therefore, the FAA  began to refer to specific regulations by the term “14 CFR  part XX.” Most regulations and the sections within are odd  numbered, because the FAA realized in 1958 when the Civil  Aeronautics Regulations were recodified into the Federal  Aviation Regulations that it would be necessary to add  regulations later.  

Over the years, the FAA has sometimes seen the need to issue  Special Federal Aviation Regulations (SFAR).  [Figure 2-3] These are frequently focused very specifically on a unique  situation and are usually given a limited length of time  for effectiveness. Note that the SFAR number is purely a  sequential number and has no relevance to the regulation it  is addressing or attached to.  

The remainder of this handbook focuses only on those  regulations relative to airworthiness certification. There  are 30 of these listed in  Figure 2-4 , and they are shown  graphically in  Figure 2-5 . A significant benefit of this chart  is the visual effect showing the interaction of the regulation  with other regulations and the placement of the regulation  relative to its impact on airworthiness. It is fundamentally  important that the definition of the term “airworthy” be  clearly understood.  

Only recently did the FAA actually define the term “airworthy”  in a regulation. (Refer to the 14 CFR part 3 excerpt following  this paragraph.) Prior to this definition in part 3, the term could  be implied from reading part 21, section 21.183. The term was  defined in other non-regulatory FAA publications, and could  also be implied from the text found in block 5 of FAA Form  8100-2, Standard Airworthiness Certificate. This certificate  is required to be visibly placed on board each civil aircraft.  (Refer to “Forms” presented later in this chapter.)  

# Title 14 CFR Part 3—General Requirements  

Definitions. The following terms have the stated meanings  when used in 14 CFR part 3, section 3.5, Statements about  products, parts, appliances and materials.  

•	 Airworthy means the aircraft conforms to its type  design and is in a condition for safe operation. •	 Product means an aircraft, aircraft engine, or aircraft  propeller. •	 Record means any writing, drawing, map, recording,  tape, film, photograph or other documentary material  by which information is preserved or conveyed in any  format, including, but not limited to, paper, microfilm,  identification plates, stamped marks, bar codes or  electronic format, and can either be separate from,  attached to or inscribed on any product, part, appliance  or material.  

Airworthiness can be divided into two areas: original  airworthiness as depicted in  Figure 2-5,  and recurrent  airworthiness as depicted in  Figure 2-6.  There are three  primary regulations that govern the airworthiness of an aircraft:  

![](images/868930c035cde47e80f241c4a202cb8735950a0e20b93679283459fec7115869.jpg)  
Comment: Civil Aeronautics Manual (CAMs) contain both regulations and advisory material in the same document.  

1.	 14 CFR part 21—Certification Procedures for Products  and Parts 2.	 14 CFR part 43—Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance,  Rebuilding, and Alterations 3.	 14 CFR part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules  

Note that the chart in  Figures 2-5  and  2-6  show most of the  other airworthiness certification regulations link to one of  these regulations.  

Although the history section that opens this chapter  discusses the FAA as if it was a single unit, it is important to  understand that there are various subgroups within the FAA,  and each have different responsibilities of oversight in the  aviation industry. These may vary by organizational chart or  geographic location.  

The maintenance technician interacts mostly with FAA  personnel from the Flight Standards Service (AFS) and the  Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) but may also have  some interaction with FAA personnel from the Aircraft  Certification Service (AIR).  

![](images/47356981deadc9594775b205937a5bf0411e814785f646fd53df59e762a67fd9.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.   Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  

# Maintenance-Related Regulations 14 CFR Part 1—Definitions and Abbreviations  

This section is a very comprehensive, but certainly not all  inclusive, list of definitions that both pilots and mechanics  must become familiar with. Many regulations often provide  additional definitions that are unique to their use and  interpretation in that specific part. Title 14 CFR part 1, section  1.2, Abbreviations and Symbols, tends to be highly focused  on those abbreviations related to flight.  

# 14 CFR Part 21—Certification Procedures for  Products and Articles  

This regulation, the first of the three, identifies the  requirements of and the procedures for obtaining type  

![Figure 2-3.   Special Federal Aviation Regulations From 14 CFR. ](images/d809ee058e287642fcef29cc1d969dd56e53b969b48d7abfbbdccfaac9b96eca.jpg)  

certificates (TCs), supplemental type certificates (STCs),  production certificates, airworthiness certificates, and  import and export approvals.  [Figure 2-5]  Some of the  other major areas covered in this part are the procedures  for obtaining a Part Manufacture Approval (PMA) or an  authorization related to producing a Technical Standard  Order (TSO) part. Note that part 21’s greatest significance  is in the original airworthiness phase, although it has minor  application in recurrent airworthiness.  [Figure 2-5]  One  of the most important sections of this regulation is section  21.50, “Instructions for continued airworthiness and  manufacturer’s maintenance manuals having airworthiness  limitations sections.” When an aircraft is delivered new from  the manufacturer, it comes with maintenance manuals that  define the inspection and maintenance actions necessary to  maintain the aircraft in airworthy condition. Also, any STC  modification that was developed after 1981 must have, as part  of the STC documentation, a complete set of instructions for  continued airworthiness (ICA). This ICA contains inspection  and maintenance information intended to be used by the  technician in maintaining that part of the aircraft that has been  altered since it was new. This ICA is comprised of 16 specific  subjects.  [Figure 2-7]  An ICA developed in accordance with  this checklist should be acceptable to the Aviation Safety  Inspector (ASI) reviewing a major alteration.  

# 14 CFR Part 23—Airworthiness Standards:  Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter Category  Airplanes  

Aircraft certificated under 14 CFR part 23 represent the  greatest portion of what the industry refers to as “general  aviation.” These aircraft vary from the small two-place piston  engine, propeller-driven trainers that are frequently used  for flight training, to turbine-powered corporate jets used  to transport business executives. Seating capacity is limited  to nine or less on all aircraft, except the commuter aircraft  where the maximum passenger seating is 19, excluding the  pilot and copilot seats.  

This part specifies the airworthiness standards that must  

![](images/1e1a8559fe09f461f773ed29ff1530b83a27cf7ea5993ded0a87ab8d133d06cb.jpg)  

criteria for the design of these aircraft. The first, subpart A,  defines the applicability of this regulation. The others are:  

•	 Subpart B—Flight •	 Subpart C—Structures •	 Subpart D—Design and Construction •	 Subpart E—Powerplant •	 Subpart F—Equipment •	 Subpart G—Flightcrew Interface and Other Information  

Within each of these subparts are numerous sections that  specify details, such as center of gravity (CG), gust load  factors, removable fasteners, the shape of certain flight  deck controls, engine and propeller requirements, fuel tank  markings, flight deck instrumentation marking and placards,  cabin aisle width, and flammability resistant standards.  

# 14 CFR Part 25—Airworthiness Standards: Transport  Category Airplanes  

The standards in 14 CFR part 25 apply to large aircraft with  a maximum certificated takeoff weight of more than 12,500  pounds. This segment of aviation is usually referred to as  “commercial aviation” and includes most of the aircraft  seen at a large passenger airport, except for the commuter  aircraft included in 14 CFR part 23. However, the ability to  carry passengers is not a requirement for aircraft certified  to 14 CFR part 25. Many of these aircraft are also used to  transport cargo. This chapter is subdivided into similar design  subpart categories and the same sequence as the requirements  specified in 14 CFR part 23.  

# 14 CFR Part 27—Airworthiness Standards: Normal  Category Rotorcraft  

This regulation deals with the small rotor wing aircraft and is  consistent with 14 CFR part 23 with limiting the passenger  seating to nine or less. However, the maximum certificated  weight is limited to 7,000 pounds. It contains similar design  subparts identified in 14 CFR part 23 that provide the details  for designing the aircraft.  

# 14 CFR Part 29—Airworthiness Standards: Transport  Category Rotorcraft  

be met in order for a manufacturer to receive a TC and  for the aircraft to receive an airworthiness certificate.  Part 23 aircraft are those aircraft that have a maximum  certificated takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less, except  for those aircraft in the commuter category. The maximum  certificated takeoff weight limit rises to 19,000 pounds or  less for these aircraft.  

This section specifies those standards applicable to helicopters  with a maximum certified weight greater than 7,000 pounds.  However, it also includes additional parameters based upon  seating capacity and an additional weight limit. Those  parameters are passenger seating, (nine or less, ten or more)  and whether the helicopter is over or under a maximum  weight of 20,000 pounds. The design subparts of part 29 are  similar to those in 14 CFR parts 23, 25, and 27.  

Part 23 has seven subparts, six of them providing detailed

Figure 2-6.   Graphic chart of FAA regulations (continued).  

# 14 CFR Part 33—Airworthiness Standards: Aircraft  Engines  

Each of the four preceding 14 CFR regulations require that the  engine used in the aircraft must be type certificated. Title 14  CFR part 33 details the requirements for both reciprocating  and turbine style aircraft engines. It not only specifies the  design and construction requirements, but also the block test  requirements that subject the engine to extremely demanding  testing in order to prove its capability of enduring the stresses  of powering the aircraft.  

# 14 CFR Part 35—Airworthiness Standards: Propellers  

Just as each engine used on an aircraft must have a TC, the  propeller must also be type certificated. This part is arranged  the same way that 14 CFR part 33 is, in that subpart B  specifies design and construction while subpart C covers  tests and inspections.  

Since regulations change over the years, not every aircraft  presently flying meets the current design regulations  as printed this year. When regulations are revised, they  are printed in the Federal Register and released with an  amendment number that ties them to the regulation being  revised. Aircraft are required to meet only the specifications  in force at the time the aircraft is built.  Note:  The preceding  statement does not apply to the mandatory requirements  imposed by Airworthiness Directives (AD), as these usually  have a compliance date included in the AD note.  

# 14 CFR Part 39—Airworthiness Directives  

In spite of all the emphasis on proper design and certification  testing, sometimes the actual day-to-day use of the aircraft  causes unanticipated wear or failure to occur. When that  happens, if the FAA determines that the wear or failure  represents an unsafe condition and that the condition is likely  to exist in other products of the same type of design, it issues  an AD. Actual AD notes are not included in 14 CFR part 39,  but rather are printed in the Federal Register and are linked  to this part as amendments to 14 CFR part 39, section 39.13.  AD notes are legally enforceable rules that apply to aircraft,  aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances.  

# 14 CFR Part 43—Maintenance, Preventive  Maintenance, Rebuilding, and Alteration  

This regulation represents the heart of aviation maintenance  and is one of the three major regulations previously identified.  The 13 rules and 6 appendices contained within 14 CFR part  43 provide the standard for maintaining all civilian aircraft  currently registered in the United States. Note that 14 CFR  part 43 has a significant relationship with part 91 and other  parts in maintaining continued airworthiness.  [Figure 2-6]  A  more detailed explanation of this regulation is presented later  

# 14 CFR Part 45—Identification and Registration  Marking  

Title 14 of the CFR part 45 includes the requirements for  the identification of aircraft, engines, propellers, certain  replacement and modification parts, and the nationality and  registration marking required on U.S.-registered aircraft. All  type-certificated products must have the following information  on a fireproof dataplate or similar approved fireproof method.  

1.	 Builder’s name 2.	 Model designation 3.	 Builder’s serial number 4.	 TC number (if any) 5.	 Production certificate number (if any) 6.	 For aircraft engines, the established rating 7.	 Reference to compliance or exemption to 14 CFR Part  34, Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements  for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes 8.	 Any other information that the FAA determines to be  appropriate  

Replacement and modification parts are produced in  accordance with a Parts Manufacturer Approvals (PMA) (14  CFR part 21, section 21.303) and must have the following  information permanently and legibly marked:  

1.	 The letters “FAA-PMA” 2.	 The name, symbol, or trademark of the holder of the  PMA 3.	 The part number 4.	 The name and model designation for each type  certificated product it can be installed on  

If a part has a specified replacement time, inspection interval,  or other related procedure specification in the maintenance  manual or ICA, that part must have a part number and a serial  number (or the equivalent of each).  

The manufacturer of a life-limited part must either provide  marking instructions for that part, or state that the part cannot  be marked without a compromise to its integrity. Exceptions  are made for the identification of parts that are too small to  be practical to mark the required data.  

Nationality and registration marks (commonly known as  the N-number for U.S.-registered aircraft) can vary in size,  depending on the year that the aircraft was built and whether  or not the aircraft has been repainted. The most common size  is at least 12 inches in height. Small aircraft built at least 30  

# ITEM SUBJECT  

1.  Introduction:   Briefly describes the aircraft, engine, propeller, or component that has been  altered.  Include any other information regarding the content, scope, purpose, arrangement,  applicability, definitions, abbreviations, precautions, units of measurement, list of parts used,  referenced publications, and distribution of the ICA, as applicable.  

2.  Description:   Of the major alteration and its functions, including an explanation of its interface  with other systems, if any.  

3.  Control, operation information:   Or special procedures, if any.  

4.  Servicing information:   Such as types of fluids used, servicing points, and location of access  panels, as appropriate.  

14.  Recommended overhaul periods:   Required to be noted on the ICA when an overhaul period  has been established by the manufacturer of a component or equipment.  If no overhaul period  exists, the ICA should state for item 14, “No additional overhaul time limitations.”  

15.  Airworthiness limitation section:   Includes any “approved” airworthiness limitations identified  by the manufacturer or FAA Type Certificate Holding Office (e.g., An STC incorporated in a  larger field-approved major alteration may have an airworthiness limitation).  The FAA  inspector should not establish, alter, or cancel airworthiness limitations without coordinating  with the appropriate FAA Type Certificate Holding Office.  If no changes are made to the  airworthiness limitations, the ICA should state for item 15, “No additional airworthiness  limitations” or “Not Applicable.”  

16.  Revision:   Includes information on how to revise the ICA.  For example, a letter will be  submitted to the local FAA Office with a copy of the revised FAA Form 337 and revised ICA.   The FAA inspector accepts the change by signing block 3 and including the following statement: “The attached revised/new Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (date______) for the above  aircraft or component major alteration have been accepted by the FAA, superseding the  Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (date______).”  After the revision has been accepted, a  maintenance record entry will be made, identifying the revision, its location, and date on the  FAA Form 337.  

years ago, or replicas of these, or experimental exhibition or  amateur-built aircraft may use letters at least 2 inches in height.  Only a few aircraft are authorized to display registration  markings of at least 3 inches. Note that this regulation sits  directly on the vertical line in  Figure 2-5  indicating that it  applies to both original and recurrent airworthiness.  

# 14 CFR Part 47—Aircraft Registration  

This regulation provides the requirements for registering  aircraft. It includes procedures for both owner and dealer  registration of aircraft.  

# 14 CFR Part 65—Certification: Airmen Other Than  Flight Crewmembers  

Pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors are  certificated under 14 CFR part 61. Flight crew other than  pilots are certificated under 14 CFR part 63. However,  many other people are also required to be certificated by  the FAA for the U.S. aviation fleet to operate smoothly and  efficiently. Title 14 CFR part 65 addresses many of those  other people.  

•	 Subpart B—Air Traffic Control Tower Operators •	 Subpart C—Aircraft Dispatchers •	 Subpart D—Mechanics •	 Subpart E—Repairmen •	 Subpart F—Parachute Riggers  

A more detailed discussion of this chapter with a special  emphasis on mechanics is included in Chapter 15, The  Mechanic Certificate.  

Note:  SFAR 100-2. Relief for U.S. Military and Civilian  Personnel who are assigned outside the United States in  support of U.S. Armed Forces Operations is a good example  of the specific nature and limited time frame that are part of  a SFAR.  

# 14 CFR Part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules  

This is the final regulation of the three major regulations  identified earlier in this chapter. Note its interaction in  Figure 2-6  with other regulations visually indicating its  “operational” involvement or “recurrent airworthiness.”  Although it is an operational regulation that is focused  toward the owner, operator, and/or pilot of the aircraft, the  maintenance technician must have an awareness of this  regulation. Two examples of these maintenance related  issues are:  

1.	 Section 91.207—Emergency Locator Transmitters  	 Paragraph (c)(2)—battery replacement interval  and requirement for a logbook entry indicating the  

2.	 Section 91.213—Inoperative Instruments and  Equipment   	 Paragraph (a)(2)—a letter of authorization from the  FSDO authorizing the operation of the aircraft under  a Minimum Equipment List (MEL) constitutes a STC  and must be carried in the aircraft during flight.  

Subpart   $E$  —Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, and  Alterations (Sections 91.401 through 91.421)  

This is the section of most interest to the technician. They  must be familiar with it, because it does carry some (indirect)  responsibility for the technician. Note that the 14 CFR part 91  icon in  Figure 2-6  has a direct line to 14 CFR part 43. This  is because section 91.403(b) states, “No person may perform  maintenance, preventive maintenance, or alterations on an  aircraft other than as prescribed in this subpart and other  applicable regulations, including part 43 of this chapter.”  A more complete discussion of this regulation, especially  Subpart E—Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, and  Alterations is presented later in this chapter.  

# 14 CFR Part 119—Certification: Air Carriers and  Commercial Operators  

In order to better understand the next three regulations  discussed here (14 CFR parts 121, 125, and 135) a brief  overview of 14 CFR part 119 is beneficial. [ Figure 2-8] There are more than 50 Advisory Circulars (ACs) in the 120  series alone providing additional non-regulatory information  concerning the variety of procedures involved with these  operations. There are basically three different criteria  that must be analyzed in order to properly determine the  regulation that applies. These are:  

1.	 Is the service provided for Private Carriage or  Common Carriage? 2.	 Is the aircraft For Hire or is it Not for Hire? 3.	 Is it a large or small aircraft?  

AC 120-12, as revised, provides the following definition  regarding this criterion: A carrier becomes a common carrier  when it “holds itself out” to the public, or to a segment of the  public, as willing to furnish transportation within the limits  of its facilities to any person who wants it. There are four  elements in defining a common carrier:  

1.	 A holding out of a willingness to 2.	 Transport persons or property 3.	From place to place4.	 For compensation  

This “holding out” that makes a person a common carrier can  be done in many ways, and it does not matter how it is done.  Signs and advertising are the most direct means of “holding  out,” but are not the only ones.  

Carriage for hire which does not involve "holding out" is  private carriage. Private carriers for hire are sometimes  called “contract carriers,” but the term is borrowed from the  Interstate Commerce Act and legally inaccurate when used  in connection with the Federal Aviation Act. Private carriage  for hire is carriage for one or several selected customers,  generally on a long-term basis. The number of contracts  must not be too great; otherwise, it implies a willingness to  make a contract with anybody. A carrier operating pursuant  to 18 to 24 contracts has been held to be a common carrier,  because it held itself out to serve the public generally to the  extent of its facilities. Private carriage has been found in  cases where three contracts have been the sole basis of the  operator’s business.  

Operations that constitute common carriage are required to  be conducted under 14 CFR part 121 or 135. Private carriage  may be conducted under 14 CFR part 91 or 125.  

The term “for hire” is not defined in any of the FAA documents  but is generally understood to mean that compensation for  both direct and indirect expenses associated with the flight,  as well as a profit margin for the operator, are collected from  the person or persons benefiting from the flight operation.  

The determination of whether the aircraft is large or small is  based upon the definition provided in 14 CFR part 1. If the  aircraft has maximum certificated takeoff weight of 12,500  pounds or more, it is a large aircraft. All aircraft less than  12,500 maximum certificated takeoff weight are considered  to be small aircraft.  

It may also help the reader understand when 14 CFR parts  121, 125, and 135 regulations apply, by taking a brief look at a  list of flight operations where 14 CFR part 119 does not apply.  

1.	 Student instruction 2.	 Nonstop sightseeing flights with less than 30 seats and  less than 25 nautical miles (NM) from the departure  airport 3.	 Ferry or training flights 4.	 Crop dusting or other agricultural operations 5.	 Banner towing 6.	 Aerial photography or surveying 7.	 Fire fighting 8.	 Powerline or pipeline patrol  

9.	 Parachute operations on nonstop flights within 25 NM  from the departure airport 10.	 Fractional ownership in accordance with 14 CFR part  91, subpart K  

# 14 CFR Part 121—Operating Requirements:  Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations  

Title 14 CFR part 121 establishes the operational rules for air  carriers flying for compensation or hire. A domestic operation  is any scheduled operation (within the 48 contiguous states,  the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession)  conducted with either a turbo-jet aircraft, an airplane having  10 or more passenger seats, or a payload capacity greater  than 7,500 pounds.  

A “flag” operation means any scheduled operation (operating  in Alaska or Hawaii to any point outside of those states, or  to any territory or possession of the United States, or from  any point outside the United States to any point outside the  United States) conducted with either a turbo-jet aircraft, an  airplane having 10 or more passenger seats, or a payload  capacity greater than 7,500 pounds.  

“Supplemental” operation means any common carriage  operation conducted with airplanes having more than 30  passenger seats (if less than 30, the airplane must also be  listed on the operations specifications of domestic and flag  carriers), with a payload capacity of more than 7,500 pounds.  

Part 121 operators are required by 14 CFR part 119 to have  the following personnel:  

•	 Director of Safety  

![](images/c5ddcdaf6c47735397a1acc93e4e49e470d81059a23799e009f6c3503a6907b6.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.   Applicability of regulations.  

•	 Director of Operations •	 Director of Maintenance •	 Chief Pilot  •	 Chief Inspector  

There are 28 subparts and 16 appendices in this regulation.  However, only subparts J and L are of concern for the mechanic.  Subpart J—Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, and  Alterations, identifies Special Airworthiness Requirements  that deals with many of the mechanical aspects of a passenger  or cargo aircraft. Subpart L—Maintenance, Preventive  Maintenance, and Alterations, requires that a part 121  operator have an operational manual that contains the  following information:  

•	 Organizational chart •	 List of individuals who may perform required  inspections  •	 Company maintenance, preventive maintenance, or  alterations •	 A system to both preserve and retrieve maintenance  and inspection related information  

Also, 14 CFR part 121, section 121.1105, establishes the  requirement for conducting inspections on aging aircraft.  

# 14 CFR Part 125—Certification and Operations:  Airplanes Having a Seating Capacity of 20 or More  Passengers or a Maximum Payload Capacity of 6,000  Pounds or More; and Rules Governing Persons on  Board Such Aircraft  

This regulation applies to private and noncommon carriage  when such operations are conducted in airplanes having  20 or more seats (excluding crewmembers) or having a  payload capacity of 6,000 pounds or more. There must also  be “operations specifications” issued to the operator that  include the following information:  

•	 Kinds of operations authorized •	 Types of aircraft and registration numbers of the  airplanes authorized for use •	 Approval of the provisions of the operator’s manual  relating to airplane inspections, together with the  necessary conditions and limitations •	 Registration numbers of the airplanes that are to  be inspected under an approved airplane inspection  program (AAIP) under 14 CFR part 125, section  125.247 •	 Procedures for the control of weight and balance of  airplanes  

Just as in 14 CFR part 121, subpart E identifies special  airworthiness requirements dealing mostly with the  mechanical devices of the aircraft.  

# 14 CFR Part 135—Operating Requirements:  Commuter and On-Demand Operations and Rules  Governing Persons on Board Such Aircraft  

As the title of this section states, this regulation is applicable  to short distance commercial aircraft operations or  “commuters” and nonscheduled carriers that operate “on- demand.” These aircraft are frequently referred to as air taxi  or air charter aircraft.  

Aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 135 must be operated  and maintained in accordance with the certificate holder’s  operations manual. This manual, when accepted by the  FAA, specifies how the flight crew, ground personnel, and  maintenance technicians conduct their operations.  

A pivotal portion of this regulation is the first section in  subpart J, 14 CFR part 135, section 135.411, Application.  This section specifies that having a type certificated passenger  seating configuration of nine or less may be maintained in  accordance with the maintenance manual provided by the  aircraft manufacturer. Those aircraft having a type certificated  passenger seating configuration of 10 or more seats must be  maintained in accordance with a maintenance manual written  by the air carrier and must then be submitted to the FAA for  approval. The requirements for the maintenance manual are  specified in 14 CFR part 135, section 135.427. 14 CFR part  135, sections 135.415 through 135.417 and 135.423 through  135.443 specify additional maintenance requirements. 14  CFR part 135, sections 135.415 and 135.417 are applicable  regardless of the number of seats in the aircraft.  

A major change in the “nine or less” aircraft maintenance  requirements occurred in February of 2005 when section 

 135.422, Aging Aircraft, was incorporated into 14 CFR part 

 135. This new subpart (note the even number) to 14 CFR  135 specifically prohibits a certificate holder from operating  certain aircraft unless the Administrator has completed the  aging aircraft inspection and records review. This inspection  requires the certificate holder to show the FAA that the  maintenance of age sensitive parts and components has been  adequate to ensure safety.  

This section only applies to multi-engine aircraft in scheduled  operation with nine or fewer passenger seats. It does not  apply to aircraft operating in Alaska. The required record  review start date varies depending on the age of the aircraft.  

However, once initiated, the repetitive inspection intervals  are not to exceed 7 years.  

The certificate holder must make both the aircraft and the  records available to the FAA for inspection and review. The  certificate holder must notify the Administrator at least 60  days in advance of the availability of the aircraft and the  records for review.  

The records must include the following information:  

1.	 Total years in service of the airplane 2.	 Total time in service of the airframe 3.	 Date of the last inspection and records review required  by this section 4.	 Current status of life-limited parts 5.	 Time since the last overhaul of all structural  components required to be overhauled on a specific  time basis 6.	 Current inspection status of the airplane, including the  time since the last inspection required by the inspection  program that the airplane is maintained under 7.	 Current status of applicable ADs, including the date  and methods of compliance, and, if the AD involves  recurring action, the time and date when the next  action is required  8.	 A list of major structural alterations 9.	 A report of major structural repairs and the current  inspection status of those repairs  

# 14 CFR Part 145—Repair Stations  

This regulation underwent a major rewrite released in 2004  and was the most comprehensive change in nearly 20 years.  It may be of interest to note an airframe and powerplant  (A&P) certificate is not necessary to be employed at a repair  station. The repair station may also employ both repairmen  (under 14 CFR part 65, subpart E) and non FAA-certificated  personnel. All work that is signed off is done so using the  repair station certificate number and must be done only by  persons authorized by 14 CFR part 65 to approve an article  for return to service (RTS). Just as other certificate holders  must have an operations manual, the repair station must have  a repair station manual that contains the following:  

•	 An organizational chart •	 Procedures for maintaining rosters •	 Description of housing, facilities, and equipment •	 Procedures for revising the capability list and  conducting a self-evaluation (audit) •	 Procedures for revising the training program  

•	 Procedures governing work done at another location •	 Procedures for working on air carrier aircraft •	 Description of the required records and record keeping •	 Procedures for revising the repair station manual •	 Description of the system to identify and control the  sections of the manual  

All records from repair station maintenance activity must  be kept a minimum of 2 years. Domestic repair station  certificates are effective until they are surrendered, suspended,  or revoked. The certificates of foreign repair stations expire,  usually after 1 or 2 years and must be renewed.  

# 14 CFR Part 147—Aviation Maintenance Technician  Schools  

Title 14 CFR part 147 defines the requirements for obtaining  a maintenance training certificate. This certificate may be for  either airframe, powerplant, or a combination of the two. The  minimum number of curriculum hours for conducting either  airframe or powerplant training independently is 1,150.  

If both A&P ratings are offered, the combined total curriculum  hours are 1,900. This is because of the 1,150 hours specified  to obtain either the airframe or the powerplant rating, 400  hours are devoted to general studies. Only one set of general  studies hours is applicable to the combined total. Therefore,  400 hours can be subtracted from the implied total of 2,300  hours (  $\{1,150\times2\}$   to obtain the reduced figure of 1,900 hours.  Requirements are detailed as follows:  

•	 Appendix A—Curriculum Requirements •	 Appendix B—General Curriculum Subjects •	 Appendix C—Airframe Curricular Subjects •	 Appendix D—Powerplant Curriculum Subjects  

# 14 CFR Part 183—Representatives of the  Administrator  

As the aviation industry grows and the design, manufacture,  and testing of aircraft gets more complex, the FAA faces  both budget constraints and personnel shortages. As early  as 1962, the FAA began a program to allow private sector  persons in various areas of industry to be “designees” or  “representatives of the FAA Administrator.” These people  are NOT FAA employees, but rather are designated by the  FAA to act on their behalf. Regular doctors may serve as 

 “aviation medical examiners,” skilled pilots can become 

 “pilot examiners,” and experienced airframe and/or  powerplant mechanics can become “designated mechanic  examiners (DME)” to administer the oral and practical  portion of the FAA testing.  

Other lesser known designees are the designated engineering  representatives (DER), the designated manufacturing  inspection representatives (DMIR), and the designated  airworthiness representatives (DAR).  

•	 DERs approve data based upon their engineering  training and their knowledge of FAA regulations. •	 DMIRs make conformity inspections only at their  employer. They are similar to “designated repairmen”  because they are only authorized to inspect parts at  their employers’ facility. •	 DARs conduct aircraft certification and aircraft  inspection functions on behalf of the FAA depending  on specific functions they are authorized.  They may  perform work for either manufacturing facilities or  maintenance entities depending on their designation.  

# Explanation of Primary Regulations (Parts 43  and 91)  

# 14 CFR Part 43—Maintenance, Preventative  Maintenance Rebuilding, and Alteration  Section 43.1—Applicability  

Paragraph (a) states quite clearly that aircraft (whether U.S.-  or foreign-registered operating under 14 CFR part 121 or  135) and component parts thereof must be maintained in  accordance with the rules set forth in this part. Although  paragraph b states quite clearly the type of aircraft that this  part does not apply to, it seems to have led to considerable  confusion within the aviation industry. If an aircraft is flying  with a Special Airworthiness—Experimental Certificate  (FAA Form 8130-7, Special Airworthiness Certificate—pink  color certificate) and that is the only airworthiness certificate  this aircraft has ever had, then 14 CFR part 43 does not apply.  

Conversely, sometimes during maintenance (especially STC  modification—the STC is addressed later in this chapter),  it becomes necessary to temporarily place the aircraft into  Special Airworthiness—Experimental. This is done to show  compliance with federal regulations. These aircraft must  still be maintained in accordance with 14 CFR part 43,  because the aircraft had a different kind of airworthiness (in  this example a Standard) prior to being issued the Special  Airworthiness Certificate.  

# Section 43.2—Records of Overhaul and Rebuilding  

These terms are not defined in 14 CFR part 1 and are given  full explanation in this subpart. Each term states that it may  not be used to describe work done on an aircraft, airframe,  aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or component part unless  that item has been:  

•	 Disassembled •	 Cleaned  

•	 Inspected  •	 Repaired, as necessary •	 Reassembled •	 Tested  

The key difference between the two terms is in determining  how the item is tested. If it is “tested in accordance with  approved standards acceptable to the Administration that  have been developed and documented by the manufacturer,  the item is said to be overhauled.” This is basically another  way of describing “service limits,” a term frequently used to  describe manufacturer specified acceptable limits for used  parts. A “rebuilt item, on the other hand, must be tested to  the same tolerances and limits as a new item.”  

# Section 43.3—Persons authorized to perform  maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  and alterations  

There are nine different persons who may perform  maintenance: (Reminder: Per 14 CFR part 1, the FAA  definition of a person is “an individual, firm, partnership,  corporation, association, joint-stock association, or  governmental entity. It includes a trustee, receiver, assignee,  or similar representative of any of them.”)  

1.	 Certificated mechanic, per 14 CFR part 65 2.	 Certificated repairman, per 14 CFR part 65 3.	 Person working under the supervision of a certificated  mechanic or repairman 4.	 Holder of repair station certificate 5.	 Holder of an air carrier certificate 6.	 Except for holders of a sport pilot certificate, the  holder of a pilot certificate issued under part 61  may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft  owned or operated by that pilot which is not used  under 14 CFR part 121, 129, or 135. The holder  of a sport pilot certificate may perform preventive  maintenance on an aircraft owned or operated by that  pilot and issued a special airworthiness certificate in  the light-sport category. 7.	 Pilot of a helicopter (when operated under 14 CFR  part 135 and in remote areas) may perform specific  preventive maintenance actions. These actions may  only be accomplished under the following conditions: •	 The mechanical difficulty or malfunction  occurred en route to or in the remote area. •	 The pilot has been satisfactorily trained and is  

authorized in writing by the certificate holder to  perform the required maintenance.  

•	 The certificate holder has procedures to evaluate  the work performed when a decision for  airworthiness is required. The work done is listed  in paragraph (c) of Appendix A of this chapter.  

8.	 Holder of part 135 certificate may allow pilots of  aircraft with nine or less passenger seats to remove and  reinstall cabin seats and stretchers and cabin mounted  medical oxygen bottles. These actions may only be  

accomplished under the following conditions: •	 The pilot has been satisfactorily trained and is  authorized in writing by the certificate holder to  perform the required maintenance. •	 The certificate holder has written procedures  available to the pilot to evaluate the work  performed. Manufacturer may inspect and rebuild any item it has  

# Section 43.5—Approval for return to service after  maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  and alterations  

Approving an aircraft component for return to service  after maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  or alteration must be done by creating an appropriate  maintenance record entry as required by either 14 CFR part  43, section 43.9 or 43.11. This may include the use of FAA  Form 337, Major Repair and Alteration, if the maintenance  action was a major repair or a major alteration. Whenever  a maintenance action is being planned, it is critical that the  technician understands exactly:  

1.	 What he/she is going to do.  2.	 How that work is classified by the FAA. 3.	 What type of documentation is required to support  this activity.  

First consider whether this a repair or an alteration. This  should be a relatively simply decision since a repair  basically returns the aircraft to its previous or unaltered  condition (i.e., replacing magnetos, an exhaust system, tires,  or brakes). Even replacing an entire engine (although it is  a big job) is still a repair if it is the one properly specified  for that aircraft. An alteration on the other hand, always  changes or modifies the aircraft from its previous state (i.e.,  installing winglets, new avionics, or an engine that is not  listed in the aircraft TCDS).  

work that to be performed constitutes a major or a minor  maintenance action. A “major” action is typically one that  might appreciably affect weight, balance, structural strength,  performance, powerplant operation, flight characteristics,  or other qualities affecting airworthiness and that are not  done according to accepted practices or cannot be done  by elementary operations. This is a much more complex  question, but it is extremely important as it drives the final  question concerning the substantiating documentation. Please  refer to 14 CFR part 1 and part 43, appendix A, for additional  clarification and examples.  

The third question deals with the type of documentation  required to substantiate the work performed. Minor repairs  and alterations need only to refer to “acceptable” data, such  as manufacturers’ maintenance manuals or AC 43.13-1.  The maintenance action can simply be recorded in the  maintenance record as a logbook entry. Major repairs and  alterations require “approved data.” Some examples of  approved data are AD notes, STCs, TCDS, DER-specific  delegations, and FAA-approved manufacturer Service  Bulletins (SB).  

Sometimes the repair or alteration being performed does not  have previously-approved data. In that case, the technician  may request that the FAA accomplish a “Field Approval.”  In this procedure, the technician completes the front side of  Form 337 through block 6 (leaving block 3 open for later  FAA approval) and then indicates in block 8 on the back what  work is to be done and what the substantiating reference data  is. Form 337 is then submitted to the local FAA FSDO office  for review and approval by an ASI. If necessary, this ASI may  seek input from other ASIs or FAA specialists to assist in the  review of the data. If the data is found to comply with FAA  regulations, the ASI enters one of the following statements  in block 3, depending on whether the ASI has performed  a review of the data only or has physically inspected the  aircraft:  

•	 “The technical data identified herein has been found  to comply with applicable airworthiness requirements  and is hereby approved for use only on the above  described aircraft, subject to conformity inspection by  a person authorized in 14 CFR part 43, section 43.7.”  	 or  •	 “The alteration or repair identified herein complies  with the applicable airworthiness requirements and  is approved for use only on the above described  aircraft, subject to conformity inspection by a person  authorized in 14 CFR part 43, section 43.7.”  

# Section 43.7—Persons authorized to approve aircraft,  airframes, aircraft engines, propellers, appliances,  or component parts for return to service after  maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  or alteration  

There are seven different persons listed in this section who  may sign RTS documentation:  

1.	 Certificated mechanic or holder of an inspection  authorization (IA). 2.	 Holder of a repair station certificate. 3.	 Manufacturer. 4.	 Holder of an air carrier certificate. 5.	 Certificated private pilot. 6.	 Repairman certificated with a maintenance rating for  light sport aircraft (LSA) only. 7.	 Certificated sport pilot for preventive maintenance on  an aircraft owned and or operated by them.  

Note that although a certificated repairman is authorized  to work on a product undergoing maintenance, preventive  maintenance, rebuilding, or alterations (refer to 14 CFR  part 43, section 43.3), they are not authorized to approve  that product for RTS. They must make the appropriate  maintenance record entry per the requirements of 14 CFR  part 43, section 43.9 or 43.11.  

# Section 43.9—Content, form and disposition of  maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  and alteration records (except inspection performed  in accordance with parts 91 and 125, and sections   $\pmb{I35.4I I(a)(l)}$   and 135.419 of this chapter)  

The first observation is that this section specifically  excludes inspection entries (those are covered in 14 CFR  part 43, section 43.11). This section deals exclusively with  maintenance record entries.  

The next observation is that the list of maintenance actions  includes “preventive maintenance.” As stated in the  explanation of 14 CFR part 43, section 43.3, a certificated  pilot is authorized to perform preventive maintenance on the  aircraft they own or operate. Therefore, remember that the  pilot must make a record entry of the preventive maintenance  they have accomplished. There are three distinct issues to  be addressed in the maintenance entry and they answer the  questions of “what?, when?, and who?”  

•	 What—a description of the work performed •	 When—the date the work was completed •	 Who—the name of the person who did the work if  

—the signature, certificate number, and type of  	 certificate of the person who is approving the
 	 work for RTS  

Note:  Frequently, logbooks have a statement entered that ends  something like this: “ … and is hereby returned to service. Joe  Fixer A&P, Certificate #123456789.” As this section of the  regulation currently reads, that part of the record entry is not  required. Title 14 of the CFR part 43, section 43.9 clearly states  that “the signature constitutes the approval for return to service  only for the work performed.” Furthermore, the technician  is only signing off the work they have done. Later, 14 CFR  part 43, section 43.11 explains that an inspection write-up  usually carries a broader scope of responsibility. This section  is very clear that the entry completed in accordance with this  section only holds the technician responsible for the service  maintenance action they entered.  

If the maintenance accomplished was a major repair or  alteration, the work must be documented on FAA Form 337  and requires supporting approved data. If the maintenance  action was a major repair and it was done by a certificated  repair station, a signed copy of the completed customer work  order accompanied by a signed maintenance release may be  used in lieu of the FAA Form 337.  

# Section 43.10—Disposition of Life-Limited Aircraft  Parts  

(Note the even number again. This regulation became part  of 14 CFR part 43 in 2002.)  

This section presents two terms not previously defined in  14 CFR:  

1.	 Life-limited part means any part that has specified a  mandatory replacement limit.  2.	 Life status means the accumulated cycles, hours, or  any other mandatory limit of a life-limited part.  

This section then goes on to specify what to do with parts  that are temporarily removed from and then reinstalled on  a type-certificated product; what to do with parts that are  removed from a type certified product and not immediately  reinstalled; and how to transfer life-limited parts from one  type-certificated product to another.  

When a life-limited part is removed, the person removing it  from the type-certificated product must control the part and  ensure proper tracking of the life-limiting factor. This is to  prevent the installation of the part after it has reached its life  limit. There are seven possible methods the technician or repair  facility may choose from to comply with this requirement.  

1.	 Recordkeeping 2.	 Tagging 3.	 Non-permanent marking 4.	 Permanent marking 5.	 Segregation 6.	 Mutilation 7.	 Any other method approved or accepted by the FAA  

When a life-limited part is transferred, the information  concerning the life status of that part must be transferred  with it. Although regulations already did exist that required  the tracking of life-limited parts when they were installed  on an aircraft, this regulation was generated to govern the  disposition of such parts when they were removed from  the aircraft.  

# Section 43.11—Content, form, and disposition of  records for inspections conducted under parts 91  and 125, and sections 135.411(a)(1) and 135.419 of  this chapter  

This section deals exclusively with inspection record  entries; however, the requirements are similar to 14 CFR  part 43, section 43.9 in that information of what, when, and  who is required.  

•	 What—type of inspection, including a brief description •	 When—date of the inspection and the total time in  service •	 Who—the signature, certificate number, and kind of  certificate of the person approving or disapproving  the RTS  

Since this is an inspection write-up and not a maintenance  entry, it is quite possible that the inspecting technician could  reject or disapprove the item being inspected for the RTS.  When that situation occurs, the regulation states in paragraph  (b) that a list of discrepancies must be given to the owner.  A reference to this list and its delivery to the aircraft owner  must be reflected in the record entry. Although the regulation  neither specifies how those discrepancies can be cleared, nor  who may do them, any appropriately-rated repair station or  certificated technician can perform the required maintenance  actions. When they are completed and the proper maintenance  record entries are generated in accordance with 14 CFR part  43, section 43.9, the aircraft is approved for RTS. It is neither  necessary to have an additional inspection, nor is it necessary  to contact the disapproving inspector.  

If the aircraft is on a progressive inspection program, the  inspection statement changes slightly from the statement  referenced earlier by adding the reference to both a  “routine inspection” and a “detailed inspection.” Refer  to explanatory text of 14 CFR part 43, section 43.15 for  a definition of these terms. Inspections accomplished in  accordance with other inspection program requirements  must identify that particular program and that part of the  program the inspection completed.  

# Section 43.12—Maintenance Records: Falsification,  Reproduction, or Alteration  

The aviation community relies heavily on trust and honesty  in both oral and written communication. The maintenance  log entries described in 14 CFR part 43, sections 43.9  and 43.11 provide the documentation trail relied upon  by aircraft owners, pilots, and technicians regarding the  aircraft’s maintenance history. Falsification of these records  is potentially dangerous to the personnel who rely on the  accuracy of these records.  

This section identifies that fraudulent entries are unacceptable.  If someone commits such an act, that action is the basis for  suspension or revocation of the appropriate certificate,  authorization, or approval. A technician who is encouraged  by their employer, or by anyone else, to falsify records in  any way should remember this comment: “Companies come  and go, but my signature lasts a lifetime. I will not use it  inappropriately.”  

# Section 43.13—Performance Rules (General)  

This section deals with the specific requirements for  conducting maintenance. ( Note:  This section best reflects  the relationship between the FAA’s numbering of ACs and  the regulations they are related to.) Paragraph 3 on the cover  page of AC 43.13-2B, Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and  Practices—Aircraft Alterations, dated March 3, 2008 states:  

“Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part  43, section 43.13(a) states that each person performing  maintenance, alteration, or preventive maintenance on  an aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance must use the  methods, techniques, and practices prescribed in the current  manufacturer’s maintenance manual or Instructions for  Continued Airworthiness prepared by its manufacturer, or  other methods techniques or practices acceptable to the  Administrator, except as noted in section 43.16.”  [Figure 2-9]  

Although not all ACs are linked this directly, there is a definite  relationship between ACs and companion regulations. Refer  to this chapter on ACs for additional information.  

Aircraft maintenance technicians (AMTs) are highly skilled  personnel, because aviation maintenance work requires great  attention to detail. The complexity of technology on today’s  aircraft demands a significant level of communication to  properly accomplish maintenance, preventive maintenance,  rebuilding, or alteration. This communication frequently  comes in written form (i.e., manufacturer’s maintenance  manuals or ICA). If neither of these documents provide the  guidance the technician needs to perform maintenance, either  AC 43.13  (AC 43.13-1 or AC 43.13-2) contain examples  of “other methods, techniques, or practices acceptable to  the Administrator” that may be sufficient.  However, these  ACs specifically state that the information is applicable to  non-pressurized areas of civil aircraft weighing 12,500 lb  gross weight or less.  

In addition to the documentation, the technician must also use  the proper tools, equipment, and test apparatus that ensures  that the work complies with accepted industry practices.  If the test equipment specified by the manufacturer is not  available, equipment that is determined to be equivalent and  acceptable to the Administrator may be used. The technician  should be cautious, however, as “proving” the equivalence of  test equipment may not be as simple as it seems.  

Air carriers (commercial—“scheduled” airlines operating  under 14 CFR part 121, the “commuter/on demand” aircraft  operating under 14 CFR part 135, and foreign air carriers  and operators of U.S.-registered aircraft under 14 CFR  part 129) may use the maintenance manual required by the  operations specifications to comply with the requirements  of this section. The operator must provide a continuous  airworthiness maintenance and inspection program  acceptable to the Administrator.  

# Section 43.15 — Additional Performance Rules for  Inspections  

This section presents general comments concerning the  responsibility of conducting an inspection and then provides  details of three separate conditions. They are rotorcraft,  annual and 100-hour inspections, and progressive inspections.  

1.	 Rotorcraft—If a rotorcraft is being inspected, specific  items, such as rotor transmissions and drive shafts,  must be inspected. 2.	 Annual and 100-hour inspections—When performing  an annual or 100-hour inspection, a checklist must  be used. This checklist may be a personal one or one  from the manufacturer. Either way, it must include  the scope and detail of the inspection in Appendix D.  Specific engine performance is also required to be  tested (or monitored) as part of RTS for an annual or  100-hour inspection. This applies whether the aircraft  is reciprocating or turbine powered. 3.	 Progressive inspection—If a progressive inspection is  being conducted, it must be preceded by a complete  aircraft inspection. ( Note:  A progressive inspection  

is the result of breaking down the large task of  conducting a major inspection into smaller tasks that  can be accomplished periodically without taking the  aircraft out of service for an extended period of time.)  Two new definitions are also presented: “routine” and  “detailed.” A routine inspection is a visual examination  or check of the item, but no disassembly is required.  A detailed inspection is a thorough examination of  the item, including disassembly. The overhaul of a  component is considered to be a detailed inspection. If the aircraft is away from the station where  inspections are normally conducted, an appropriately  rated mechanic, a certificated repair station, or the  manufacturer of the aircraft may perform inspections  in accordance with the procedures and using the  forms of the person who would otherwise perform  the inspection.  

# Section   43.16 — Airworthiness  Limitations  

The technician performing inspection or maintenance actions  on an aircraft must be certain they have all appropriate data  available. Each person performing an inspection or other  maintenance specified in an Airworthiness Limitations section  of a manufacturer's maintenance manual or Instructions for  Continued Airworthiness shall perform the inspection or  other maintenance in accordance with that section, or in  accordance with operations specifications approved by  the Administrator under part 121 or 135, or an inspection  program approved under 14 CFR part 91, section 91.409(e).  ICAs, as required by 14 CFR part 21, section 21.50, must  also be consulted when available. Since 1998, the FAA  has required ICAs to be generated for all major alterations  that are accomplished by the field approval process. This  section specifies that the technician is responsible to perform  inspections or maintenance specified in an airworthiness  limitation in accordance with all the preceding instructions.  

# Section 43.17—Maintenance, preventive maintenance,  or alterations performed on U.S. aeronautical  products by certain Canadian persons  

This section was significantly revised in 2005, as the result  of a Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) between  the United States and Canada. This section of 14 CFR  part 43 defines some terms and gives specific limitations  as to what an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME is  the Canadian equivalent to the U.S. A&P) may do to  maintain U.S.-registered aircraft located in Canada. It also  provides similar limitations for an Approved Maintenance  Organization. (AMO is the Canadian equivalent to the U.S.- certified repair stations.)

# Advisory Circular  

Subject:  Acceptable Methods,  Techniques, and Practices – Aircraft  Alterations  

# Date:  3/3/08  Initiated by:  AFS-300  

AC No:  43.13-2B  1. PURPOSE.   This advisory circular (AC) contains methods, techniques, and practices  acceptable to the Administrator for the inspection and alteration on non-pressurized areas of civil  aircraft of 12,500 lbs gross weight or less.  This AC is for use by mechanics, repair stations, and  other certificated entities.  This data generally pertains to minor alterations; however, the alteration  data herein may be used as approved data for major alterations when the AC chapter, page, and  paragraph are listed in block 8 of FAA Form 337 when the user has determined that it is:  

a.  Appropriate to the product being altered,  b.  Directly applicable to the alteration being made, and  c. Not contrary to manufacturer’s data.  

2. CANCELLATION.   AC 43.13-2A, Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices―  Aircraft Alterations, dated January 1, 1977, is canceled.  

3. REFERENCE.   Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 43,  $\S\ 43.13$  (a)  states that each person performing maintenance, alteration, or preventive maintenance on an  aircraft, engine, propeller, or appliance must use the methods, techniques, and practices  prescribed in the current manufacturer’s maintenance manual or Instructions for Continued  Airworthiness prepared by its manufacturer, or other methods, techniques, or practices  acceptable to the Administrator, except as noted in   $\S\ 43.16$  .  FAA inspectors are prepared to  answer questions that may arise in this regard.  Persons engaged in the inspection and alteration  of civil aircraft should be familiar with 14 CFR part 43, Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance,  Rebuilding, and Alterations, and part 65, subparts A, D, and E of Certification: Airmen Other  than Flight Crewmembers, and applicable airworthiness requirements under which the aircraft  was type-certificated.  

4. COMMENTS INVITED.   Comments regarding this AC should be directed to DOT/FAA:  ATTN: Aircraft Maintenance Division, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591,  FAX (202) 267-5115.  

ORIGINAL SIGNED By  

# Preventive Maintenance  

This appendix provides a comprehensive, but not exclusive,  list of subjects. For instance, paragraph (a) is titled Major  Alteration, and is further subdivided as follows:  

•	 Airframe •	 Powerplant •	 Propeller •	 Appliance  

This same subdivision is used in paragraph (b), Major  Repairs. Paragraph (c), Preventive Maintenance, identifies  those maintenance actions that are defined as preventive  maintenance, provided the maintenance does not involve  complex assembly operations. Preventive maintenance work  may be accomplished by the holder of at least a private pilot  certificate provided they are the owner or operator of that  aircraft, and it is not operated under 14 CFR part 121, 129,  or 135.  

# Appendix B—Recording of Major Repairs and Major  Alterations  

In most cases when a major repair or alteration is  accomplished, FAA Form 337, Major Repair or Alteration,  is completed at least in duplicate with the original going  to the aircraft owner and a copy sent to the FAA Aircraft  Registration Branch in Oklahoma City where all civil aircraft  information is compiled and retained.  Note:  Historically,  the second copy was sent to the local FAA FSDO within 48  hours after RTS. This copy is reviewed by an ASI and then  forwarded by the FSDO to FAA records in Oklahoma City.  However, in the fall of 2005, the FAA made a significant  change to this submittal process and now requires the  technician to submit the Form 337 directly to the Aircraft  Registration Branch in Oklahoma City. Although a third  copy is not required, it makes good business sense for the  technician or certified repair station to keep a copy of the  work that was accomplished.  

However, if a certificated (part 145) repair station completes  a major repair, it may provide the customer with a signed  copy of the work order and a maintenance release signed  by an authorized representative of the repair station, instead  of the FAA Form 337. If the major repair or alteration was  done by an AME or AMO, the copy normally provided  to the FAA-FSDO is sent directly to the FAA Aircraft  Registration Branch.  

However, if extended range tanks are installed in either  passenger or cargo compartments, the technician must  generate a third FAA Form 337 for the modification. This  copy must be placed and retained in the aircraft. (Refer to  14 CFR part 91, section 91.417(d).)  

# Appendix   $c$  —(Reserved)  

Appendix C is reserved for future use and therefore currently  contains no information.  

# Appendix   $\pmb{D}$  —Scope and Detail of Items To Be  Included in Annual and 100-Hour Inspections  

Some important items to consider in this appendix are:  

1.	 The list of items and areas to be inspected are exactly  the same for an annual as a 100-hour inspection.  The difference between the inspections is in who is  authorized to perform and approve the aircraft for RTS  following the inspection. Refer to 14 CFR part 65,  section 65.95(a)(2) that states that an IA must perform  an annual inspection. 2.	 The aircraft and engine must be cleaned prior to  conducting the inspection. 3.	 Any miscellaneous item not covered in the detailed  list provided must also be inspected for improper  installation and operation. 4.	 There are eight specific areas identified for detailed  inspection. They are the fuselage hull group, cabin/ flight deck group, engine/nacelle group, landing  gear group, wing/center section group, empennage  assembly, propeller group, and the radio group.  

# Appendix  $E$  —Altimeter System Test and Inspection  

This is commonly referred to as “the 411 test.” Refer to 14 CFR  part 91, section 91.411 that requires that no person may operate  an aircraft in controlled airspace under IFR unless the aircraft  has had this test completed successfully within the preceding  24 months.) This section requires detailed testing of the static  pressure system, the altimeter, and the automatic pressure  altitude reporting equipment, and that the test information be  recorded in the maintenance logs and on the altimeter.  

# Appendix   $F\!\cdot$  —ATC Transponder Tests and  Inspections  

This is commonly referred to as “the 413 test.” (Refer to 14  CFR part 91, section 91.413, which requires that no person  may use a transponder unless it has had this test completed  successfully within the preceding 24 months.)  

This section specifies complex sets of tests, which may be  accomplished either as a bench test or by using portable  test equipment. Major categories of the testing required are  radio reply frequency, suppression, receiver sensitivity, radio  frequency peak output power, and mode S (when applicable).  Upon completion of testing, proper entries must be made in  the maintenance record.  

# 14 CFR Part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules Subpart   $_A$  —General  

As mentioned in the brief overview of the regulation portion  earlier in this chapter, this part is actually addressing the  operation of the aircraft. For example, 14 CFR part 91, section  91.7(a) states “no person may operate a civil aircraft unless it  is in an airworthy condition.” We learned earlier that this term  means that the aircraft conforms to its approved type design  and is in condition for safe operation. When the pilot performs  a preflight inspection, they are making a determination  concerning the “condition for safe operation.” The pilot does  not usually determine “conformity to type design” unless  they perform a review of the maintenance records. However,  since that is fundamental to the definition of airworthy, it  is still part of their responsibility. Therefore, a professional  and ethical technician wants to help the customer understand  their responsibilities in maintaining and documenting the  airworthiness of the aircraft.  

# Subpart  $E$  —Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance,  and Alterations  

Section 91.401—Applicability  

Although this subpart describes in general the rules regarding  maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration, certain  sections do not apply if the aircraft is operated in accordance  with 14 CFR part 121, 125, 129, or 135.  

Section 91.403—General  

The owner/operator holds the primary responsibility  for maintaining the aircraft in airworthy condition. This  includes compliance with all applicable ADs and is the  reason that the FAA sends new AD notes to the registered  owners of the affected aircraft. All maintenance performed  must be accomplished in accordance with 14 CFR part 43.  Compliance with the appropriate manufacturer maintenance  manuals and ICA is also required. Mandatory replacement  times, inspection intervals, and related procedures as outlined  in the FAA‑approved operations specifications must also be  complied with.  

Section 91.405—Maintenance Required  

The owner/operator is required to have the appropriate  inspections made, and to have discrepancies repaired in  accordance with part 43. They are also required to ensure that  the appropriate entries have been made in the maintenance  records. Any inoperative instruments or equipment must be  properly placarded as inoperative.  

Section 91.407—Operation after maintenance, preventive  maintenance, or alteration  

Whenever the aircraft has undergone maintenance,  preventive maintenance, rebuilding or alteration, it must  have been approved for RTS and a proper entry made in  the maintenance records. If the maintenance that was done  could have appreciably changed the flight characteristics, an  appropriately rated pilot must perform an operational flight  check of the aircraft and must make an entry of the flight in  the maintenance records. If ground testing and inspection can  show conclusively that the maintenance has not adversely  affected the flight characteristics, no flight test is required.  

# Section 91.409—Inspections  

This paragraph identifies various types of inspection  applicable to the civilian aircraft fleet. Paragraph (a) defines  the requirement for an annual inspection. However, there are  certain exceptions to this regulation:  

1.	 An aircraft that carries a special flight permit, a current  experimental certificate, or a light-sport or provisional  airworthiness certificate; 2.	 An aircraft inspected in accordance with an approved  aircraft inspection program under part 125 or 135  of this chapter and so identified by the registration  number in the operations specifications of the  certificate holder having the approved inspection  program; 3.	 An aircraft subject to the requirements of paragraph  (d) or (e) of this section; or 4.	 Turbine-powered rotorcraft when the operator elects  to inspect that rotorcraft in accordance with paragraph  (e) of this section.  

Annual inspections are usually the inspection method  associated with small “general aviation” aircraft. If this same  aircraft is used for hire (including flight instruction for hire),  then the aircraft must also be inspected every 100 hours of  time in service. This requirement for a 100-hour inspection  to be conducted on an aircraft may be exceeded by as much  as 10 hours if the aircraft is en route to reach a facility that  will be conducting the inspection. Any time accrued between  100 and 110 hours is subtracted from the hours remaining  before the next 100-hour inspection.  

Since aircraft used for hire only generate revenue when they  are flying, any time that the aircraft is “down for inspection”  can result in a loss of income for the owner/operator.  Therefore, the FAA has made provision to minimize the  impact of the 100-hour and annual inspection requirement.  The owner/operator may petition the local FSDO for approval  of a progressive inspection program. This program breaks  the complete inspection of the aircraft into smaller, less  time-consuming steps. (Refer to 14 CFR part 43, Appendix  D.) This inspection may be either performed or supervised  by a technician holding an IA. The program must ensure at  all times that the aircraft is airworthy. The owner/operator  must submit an inspection schedule with their application  to the FAA. This schedule must identify the time intervals  (hours or days) when routine and detailed inspections are to  be accomplished. (Refer to 14 CFR part 43, section 43.15.)  Just as with the 100-hour inspection, a 10-hour maximum  extension of a specified inspection interval is allowed if the  aircraft is en route. A change in the inspection interval is also  allowed for changes in service experience. If the progressive  inspection is discontinued, the aircraft is again subject to the  traditional annual and 100-hour inspections.  

Other inspection programs that may be applicable to other  aircraft are a continuous airworthiness inspection program  and an approved aircraft inspection program (AAIP).  The former program is applicable to either a part 121 or  135 carrier, but the latter program is limited to part 135  operators only. Finally, the owner/operator may use either  a current inspection program recommended by the aircraft  manufacturer or one established by the owner/operator and  approved by the local FSDO. Any subsequent changes to that  program must also be approved by the local FSDO.  

There may be an instance when the operator of an aircraft  wishes to change from one type of inspection program to  another. In that case, the time in service, calendar times, or  cycles of operation from the current program must be carried  over to the subsequent program.  

Section 91.411—Altimeter System and Altitude Reporting  Equipment Tests and Inspections  

Commonly referred to as “the 411 test,” this section specifies  the requirements for testing the static pressure system, each  altimeter instrument, and each automatic pressure altitude  reporting system every 24 calendar months. The static system  must also be tested any time it has been “opened and closed,”  except for the normal use of the system drain and alternate  static system pressure valves. If the automatic pressure  altitude reporting system of the air traffic control (ATC)  transponder is either installed or subjected to maintenance  actions, the system must also be tested per Appendix E of  14 CFR part 43.  

Due to the inherent design and accuracy of this system, only  the aircraft manufacturer, a properly-rated repair station, or a  certificated airframe mechanic may perform these tests. The  airframe technician may only perform the inspection and test  of the static pressure system. Calibration and maintenance  of related instruments is specifically prohibited to the  technician by the language of 14 CFR part 65, section 65.81  and specifically allowed in 14 CFR part 145, section 145.59  for repair stations holding an instrument rating.  

TSO’d items are considered to be “tested and inspected” as  of the date they were manufactured. The maximum altitude  that the system was tested is the maximum altitude that  the aircraft can be flown instrument flight rules (IFR) in  controlled airspace.  

Section 91.413—ATC Transponder Tests and Inspections This “413 test” is the other test required every 24 months.  Whenever the ATC transponder is installed or has undergone  maintenance, the complete system must be tested and inspected  in accordance with Appendix E of 14 CFR part 43. The  transponder itself must be tested and inspected in accordance  with Appendix F of 14 CFR part 43. As with the 411 test,  only certain persons are authorized to conduct the tests. They  are the manufacturer of the aircraft, a properly certificated  repair station, or the holder of a continuous airworthiness  maintenance program under 14 CFR part 121 or 135.  

# Section 91.415—Changes to Aircraft Inspection Programs  

If the FAA determines that the inspection program established  and approved under either 14 CFR part 91, section 91.409  or 91.1109 must be revised to ensure continued safety and  adequacy of the program, the owner/operator must make  the necessary changes as identified by the Administrator.  If the owner/operator desires to contest this request, they  must petition the FAA to reconsider their request to change  the program within 30 days of receiving the change request  from the FAA.  

# Section 91.417—Maintenance Records  

The understanding and implementation of this section  is fundamental to the aircraft industry, in general, and  the aircraft owner/operator, in specific. A professional  maintenance technician must be knowledgeable of this  section and be able to help the owner/operator understand it.  [Figure 2-10]  This section identifies four types of records— two are quite specific (paragraphs a and d) and two are more  general: (a)(1) and (a)(2). Paragraph (a) refers to the 411 and  413 testing that requires testing every 24 months. Therefore,  records must be kept for that length of time. Paragraph (d)  refers to the installation of fuel tanks in the cabin or cargo  area. The FAA Form 337 authorizing this installation must  be kept on board the aircraft all the time.  

Note:  Other than this paragraph, there is no requirement  that the maintenance records of the aircraft be carried on the  aircraft. In fact, there are very logical reasons to not do so in  most cases. The two biggest concerns are damaged or lost  records. It is much safer to retain the logs in a filing system  in the office. It is also a very wise idea to have the logbook  copied or scanned and retained at a separate location should  a catastrophic event (fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, and so  forth) occur at the site the original records are retained.  

Subparagraph (a)(1) then lists those records that are later  defined in (b)(1) as being retained for 1 year or until the  work is repeated or superseded. Subparagraph (a)(2) specifies  the records that are permanent records and are identified  in subparagraph (b)(2) as those that must be transferred  with the aircraft. Refer to the chart for further clarification.  [Figure 2-10]  

Paragraph (c) requires that all of the maintenance records  mandated by this section be made available upon request  to the Administrator or any authorized representative of  the NTSB. Furthermore, the owner/operator must provide  the Form 337 required to be aboard the aircraft whenever  additional fuel tanks are installed in either the passenger  compartment or the baggage compartment, per paragraph  (d), to any law enforcement officer upon request.  

Section 91.419—Transfer of Maintenance Records  

When an aircraft is sold, it is logical that the records are  transferred with it. They may be either in plain language or  coded. The purchaser may elect to permit the seller to retain  the actual records; however, if that occurs the purchaser (now  the current owner/operator) must still make these records  available to either the FAA or the NTSB upon request.  

# Section 91.421—Rebuilt Engine Maintenance Records  

This section presents the term “zero time.” Although not  truly given as a definition, the wording of the regulation is  very clear that an aircraft engine, when rebuilt by the engine  manufacturer or an agency approved by the manufacturer,  may be given a new maintenance record showing no  previous operating history. This new record must include a  signed statement with the date it was rebuilt, any changes  incorporated by compliance with AD notes, and compliance  with any of the manufacturer’s SB.  

# Civil Air Regulations (CAR)  

Prior to 1926, access to flying was uncontrolled. No licensing  or certification was required. By the middle of the 1920s, it  became obvious that unregulated private and commercial  flying was dangerous. There was a growing awareness  and acceptance that regulation could improve safety and  encourage growth in aviation. Therefore in 1926, the aviation  industry requested Congress to enact federal legislation to  regulate civil aviation. Thus, the Air Commerce Act of 1926  provided for the:  

1.	 Establishment of airways. 2.	 Development of aviation aids. 3.	 Investigation of aviation accidents. 4.	 Licensing of pilots. 5.	 Certification of aircraft.  

The Civil Air Regulations (CARs) were part of the original  certification basis for aircraft first certified in the 1940s,  1950s, and 1960s by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).  Therefore, the CARs may still be needed as a reference for  these older aircraft or as a standard for minor changes to older  aircraft designs.  [Figure 2-11]  

# CAR 3—Airplane Airworthiness—Normal, Utility,  Aerobatic, and Restricted Purpose Categories  

As the name implies, this specific regulation is the basis for  the current 14 CFR part 23 regulation [ Figure 2-1 ]. It has  the following subpart categories:  

•	 A—Airworthiness Requirements •	 B—Flight Requirements—General •	 C—Strength Requirements—General •	 D—Design and Construction—General •	 E—Powerplant Installations—Reciprocating Engines •	 F—Equipment  

Some examples of CAR 3 aircraft are Piper PA 22, PA 28,  PA 32, and Cessna 182, 195, and 310.  

Note:  The “CAR” acronym actually has two interpretations:  Civil Air Regulations and Canadian Aviation Regulations.  The technician must clearly understand the difference and  recognize when one or the other is appropriate.  

# CAR 4a—Airplane Airworthiness  

This regulation was originated in 1936 and last amended on  December 15, 1952. The subparts included in this regulation  are:  

•	 A—Airworthiness Requirements •	 B—Definitions •	 C—Structural Loading Conditions, General Structural
 	 Requirements •	 D—Proof of Structure •	 E—Detail Design and Construction •	 F—Equipment •	 G—Powerplant Installation •	 H—Performance •	 I—Miscellaneous Requirements  

Initially, this regulation was the basis for establishing the design  requirements for virtually all produced aircraft in the 1930s,  1940s, and 1950s. Eventually CAR 3 evolved as the regulatory  material specific to small aircraft, and CAR 4a and b focused on  regulatory requirements for large aircraft.  

It is very important to review the TCDS for each aircraft.  For example, The Cessna 140 was certified as a landplane  under CAR 3, but under CAR 4a as a ski-plane or seaplane.  Another example of a more current and larger aircraft is the  Gulfstream 1159 and 1159A. The former is certified under  CAR 4b, but the latter is certified to 14 CFR part 25.  

# Suspected Unapproved Parts (SUP)  

There are four types of aircraft parts:  

1.	 Good parts with good paperwork. 2.	 Good parts with bad paperwork. 3.	 Bad parts with “good” (bogus) paperwork. 4.	 Bad parts with bad paperwork.  

The first of those listed represents properly authorized parts that,  when properly installed, are approved parts, and the aircraft  can be returned to service. The last of those listed represent  unauthorized and unapproved parts. The technician should  be alert for these and must never install them on an aircraft.  

The center two categories of parts represent suspected  unapproved parts. If either the physical part or the paperwork  associated with the part is questionable, it is best to contact  the shop foreman, shift supervisor, or the assigned quality  individual to discuss your concerns. Suspected unapproved  parts (SUPs) should be segregated and quarantined until  proper disposition can be determined. Contacting the  manufacturer of the product is a good way to start gathering  the facts concerning the product in question. Refer to the  current version of AC 21-29, Detecting and Reporting  Suspected Unapproved Parts, for additional information.  

Current contact information for submitting a SUP Notification  can be found at www.faa.gov.  

# Other FAA Documents  

# Advisory Circulars (AC)  

AC refers to a type of publication offered by the FAA  to provide guidance for compliance with airworthiness  regulations. They provide guidance such as methods,  procedures, and practices acceptable to the Administrator  for complying with regulations. ACs may also contain  explanations of regulations, other guidance material, best  practices, or information useful to the aviation community.  They do not create or change a regulatory requirement. The  AC system became effective in 1962. It provides a single,  uniform, agency-wide system that the FAA uses to deliver  advisory material to FAA customers, industry, the aviation  community, and the public.  

Unless incorporated into a regulation by reference, the  content of ACs are not binding on the public. ACs are  issued in a numbered-subject system corresponding to the  subject areas of the FARs (14 CFR, Chapter 1, Federal  Aviation Administration) and Chapter 3, Commercial Space  Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Department  of Transportation, Parts 400–450. An AC is issued to provide  guidance and information in a designated subject area or to  show a method acceptable to the Administrator for complying  with a related federal aviation regulation.  

Because of their close relationship to the regulations, ACs are  arranged in a numbered system that corresponds to the subject  areas of the CFRs. In some series, consecutive numbers may  

![](images/d0ad10a66951d3ae563a57a40366b3ea65ffbc7a8615e99ac0c32c0bbb450af3.jpg)

be missing. These numbers were either assigned to ACs  still in preparation that will be issued at a later date or were  assigned to ACs that have been canceled.  

# The AC Numbering System  

There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42-C.  

•	 The first part of the number identifies the subject  matter area of the AC. This corresponds to the part  of the FAA’s regulations. In the above example, this  would be part 25. •	 The second part of the number, beginning with the  dash, is a sequential number within each subject area.  In the above example, this would be the 42nd AC  relating to part 25. •	 The third part of the number is a letter assigned by  the originating office showing the revision sequence  if an AC is revised. The first version of an AC does  not have a revision letter. In the above example, this is  third revision, as designated by the “C.”  [Figure 2-12]  

# Airworthiness Directives (AD)  

In accordance with 14 CFR part 39, the FAA issues ADs in  response to deficiencies and/or unsafe conditions found in  aircraft, engines, propellers, or other aircraft parts. ADs require  that the relevant problem must be corrected on all aircraft or  aircraft parts using the same design. ADs are initiated as either  proposed, corrective, or final (telegraphic) via the Federal  Register. The Federal Register is the official daily publication  of the United States Government. It is the printed method of  informing the public of laws that are enacted or will be enacted.  Electronic versions of ADs are available from the Federal  Register and from the Regulatory and Guidance Library. You  can search by manufacturer, model, or AD number. All ADs  are “incorporated by reference” into part 39 and are considered  final. ADs must be followed to remain in compliance with  the FAA. Once an AD has been issued, a person/company is  authorized to use the affected aircraft or part only if it has been  corrected in accordance with the AD.  

# Types of Airworthiness Directives (AD)  

Three types of ADs are issued:  

•	 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), followed  by a Final Rule  •	 Final Rule; Request for Comments •	 Emergency ADs  

The standard AD process is to issue an NPRM followed  by a Final Rule. After an unsafe condition is discovered,  a proposed solution is published as an NPRM and solicits  public comment on the proposed action. After the comment  period closes, the final rule is prepared, taking into account  all substantive comments received with the rule perhaps being  changed as warranted by the comments. The preamble to the  final rule AD provides response to the substantive comments  or states there were no comments received.  

In certain cases, the critical nature of an unsafe condition  may warrant the immediate adoption of a rule without prior  notice and solicitation of comments. This is an exception to  the standard process. If time for the terminating action to  be accomplished is too short to allow for public comment  (that is, less than 60 days), then a finding of im practicability  is justified for the terminating action, and it can be issued  as an immediately adopted rule. The immediately adopted  rule is published in the Federal Register with a request for  comments. The Final Rule AD may be changed later if  substantive comments are received.  

An Emergency AD is issued when an unsafe condition exists  that requires immediate action by an owner/operator. The  intent of an Emergency AD is to rapidly correct an urgent  safety deficiency. An Emergency AD may be distributed  by fax, letter, or other methods. It is issued and effective to  only the people who actually receive it. This is known as  “actual notice.” All known owners and operators of affected  U.S.-registered aircraft, or those aircraft that are known to  have an affected product installed, are sent a copy of an  Emergency AD. To make the AD effective to all persons, a  follow up publication of the Final Rule AD in the Federal  Register is critical. This Final Rule AD must be identical to  the Emergency AD and is normally published in the Federal  Register within 30 days of the Emergency AD issue.  

# AD Content  

Generally, ADs include:  

•	 A description of the unsafe condition  •	 The product that the AD applies to  •	 The required corrective action or operating limitations  or both  •	 The AD effective date  •	 A compliance time  •	 Where to go for more information  •	 Information on alternative methods of compliance  with the requirements of the AD  

# AD Number  

ADs have a three-part number designator. The first part is the  calendar year of issuance. The second part is the biweekly  period of the year when the number is assigned. The third part  is issued sequentially within each biweekly period.  

# Applicability and Compliance  

The AD subject line specifically identifies the TC holder  of the aircraft or products affected by the AD. The specific  models affected and any special considerations, such as  specific installed part numbers or modifications, are listed  in the AD applicability section. In order to find all applicable  ADs for a specific product, you must search for ADs on  the product, aircraft, engine(s), propeller, or any installed  appliance. If there are multiple series under the aircraft or  engine model, you must also search for ADs applicable  to the model, as well as the specific series of that model.  The final determination of ADs applicable to a particular  product can only be made by a thorough examination of the  ADs and the product logbooks. No person may operate a  product that an AD applies to, except in accordance with the  requirements of the AD. Furthermore, the owner or operator  of an aircraft is required by 14 CFR part 91, section 91.403  to maintain the aircraft in compliance with all ADs. The  AD specifies a compliance time that relates to the effective  date of the AD. That compliance time determines when the  actions are required.  

# Alternative Method of Compliance  

Different approaches or techniques that are not specified in  an AD can, after FAA approval, be used to correct an unsafe  condition on an aircraft or aircraft product. Although the  alternative was not known at the time the AD was issued,  an alternative method may be acceptable to accomplish the  intent of the AD. A compliance time that differs from the  requirements of the AD can also be approved if the revised  time period and approved alternative method provides an  acceptable level of safety as the requirements of the AD.  

# Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB)  

A Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) is an  information tool that the FAA uses to alert, educate, and make  recommendations to the aviation community. SAIBs contain  non-regulatory information and guidance that does not meet  the criteria for an AD.  [Figure 2-13]  

# Aircraft Specifications  

Specifications were originated during implementation of  the Air Commerce Act of 1926. Specifications are FAA  recordkeeping documents issued for both type-certificated  and non-type-certificated products that have been found  eligible for U.S. airworthiness certification. Although they  are no longer issued, specifications remain in effect and will  be further amended. Specifications covering type-certificated  products may be converted to a TCDS at the option of the  TC holder. However, to do so requires the TC holder to  provide an equipment list. A specification is not part of a  TC. Specifications are subdivided into five major groups  as follows:  

1.	 Group I—Type Certificate Aircraft, Engines, and  Propellers. Covering standard, restricted, and limited  types issued for domestic, foreign, and military surplus  products.  

2.	 Group II—Aircraft, Engine, and Propeller Approvals.  Covering domestic, foreign, and military surplus  products constructed or modified between October 1,  1927, and August 22, 1938. All have met minimum  airworthiness requirements without formal type  certification. Such products are eligible for standard  airworthiness certification as though they are type- certificated products.  

3.	 Group III—Aircraft, Engine, and Propeller Approvals.  Covering domestic products manufactured prior to  October 1, 1927, foreign products manufactured prior  to June 20, 1931, and certain military surplus engines  and propellers. All have met minimum airworthiness  requirements of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 and  implementing Air Commerce Regulations without  formal type certification. Such products are eligible  for standard airworthiness certification as though they  are type-certificated products.  

4.	 Group IV—Engine Ratings. Covering unapproved  engines rated for maximum power and speed only,  their use being limited to specific aircraft with  maximum gross weights less than 1,000 pounds. Such  engines are not eligible for independent airworthiness  certification. These ratings are no longer issued.  

5.	 Group V—Engine Approvals. Covering military  surplus engines meeting CAR 13 design requirements  without formal type certification. Such engines are  eligible for airworthiness certification as though they  are type-certificated engines.  

# Supplemental Type Certificates (STC)  

When an aircraft is designed and that design is formally  approved for manufacturing, the manufacturer is issued  a Type Certificate (TC). The TC is issued by the FAA to  signify the airworthiness of an aircraft design and may not  be changed except by formal authorization of the FAA.  This formal authorization supplements the original TC  and is called the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC).  Therefore, the STC issued by the FAA approves a product  (aircraft, engine, or propeller) modification.  [Figure 2-14] The STC defines the product design change, states how the  modification affects the existing type design, and lists serial  number effectivity. It also identifies the certification basis  listing specific regulatory compliance for the design change.  Information contained in the certification basis is helpful for  those applicants proposing subsequent product modifications  and evaluating certification basis compatibility with other  STC modifications. Refer to  Figure 2-15  for a listing of how  

# Advisory Circular Numbering System  

1. General.  The advisory circular numbers relate to the FAR subchapter title and correspond to the Parts, and when appropriate, to the specific  sections of the Federal Aviation Regulations.  

![2. General and specific subject numbers.   The subject numbers and related subject areas are as follows: ](images/57cf3a6bd38e970a6f241286a54c25fb861986f7faf79c43e20c1ea526eac7e0.jpg)  

![](images/88967549bbdce6ff12e2d2c612ee26045b9ced3991b1d95bcf98b3cbdf2fb37b.jpg)  

![](images/36b0e6c10acb4cb4d7d852272240c29f9606de9a9db9dc51da8579be4c204a45.jpg)  

4. Individual circular identification numbers. Each circular has a subject number followed either by a dash and a consecutive  number (135-15) or a period with a specific FAR section number, followed by a dash and a consecutive number (135.169-2)  identifying the individual circular. This consecutive number is not used again in the same subject series. Revised circulars have a  letter A, B, C, etc., after the consecutive number to show complete revisions. Changes to circulars have Chg. 1, Chg. 2, Chg. 3, etc.,  after the identification number on pages that have been changed. The Date on a revised page is changed to the date of the  Change transmittal.  

# Non-FAA Documents  

Possession of the STC document does not constitute rights to  the design data or installation of the modification. The STC  and its supporting data (drawings, instructions, specifications,  and so forth) are the property of the STC holder. You must  contact the STC holder to obtain rights for the use of the STC.  

# Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS)  

The TCDS is a formal description of the aircraft, engine, or  propeller. It lists limitations and information required for type  certification including airspeed limits, weight limits, thrust  limitations, and so forth.  

TCDSs and specifications set forth essential factors and  other conditions that are necessary for U.S. airworthiness  certification. Aircraft, engines, and propellers that conform  to a U.S. TC are eligible for U.S. airworthiness certification  when found to be in a condition for safe operation and  ownership requisites are fulfilled.  [Figure 2-16]  

TCDSs were originated and first published in January 1958.  Title 14 of the CFR part 21, section 21.41 indicates they are  part of the TC. As such, a TCDS is evidence the product has  been type certificated. Generally, TCDSs are compiled from  details supplied by the TC holder; however, the FAA may  request and incorporate additional details when conditions  warrant.  [Figure 2-17]  

Under federal law, no civil aircraft registered in the United  States can operate without a valid airworthiness certificate.  This certificate must be approved and issued by the FAA;  and it is only issued if the aircraft and its engines, propellers,  and appliances are found to be airworthy and meet the  requirements of an FAA-approved TC. The FAA issues a TC  when a new aircraft, engine, propeller, and so forth, is found  to meet safety standards set forth by the FAA. The TCDS  lists the specifications, conditions, and limitations that the  airworthiness requirements were met under for the specified  product, such as engine make and model, fuel type, engine  limits, airspeed limits, maximum weight, minimum crew,  and so forth. TCDSs are issued and revised as necessary  to accommodate new models or other major changes in the  certified product. TCDSs are categorized by TC holder and  product type.  

# FAA Handbooks & Manuals  

The FAA publishes handbooks and manuals for beginners and  aviation professionals. Publications are updated periodically  to reflect new FAA regulations and technical developments.  Figure 2-18  shows a list of aircraft and aviation handbooks  and manuals available on the FAA website ( www.faa.gov ).  

# Air Transport Association ATA iSpec 2200  

To standardize the technical data and maintenance activities  on large and therefore complex aircraft, the ATA e-Business  Program has established a classification of maintenance  related actions. These are arranged with sequential numbers  assigned to ATA chapters. These chapters are consistent  regardless of the large aircraft that is being worked on.  [Figure 2-19]  

# Manufacturers’ Published Data  

The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is usually  the best source of information for the operation of and  maintenance on a particular product. If the product is a TC’d  or STC’d item, 14 CFR part 21, section 21.50 requires the  holder of the design approval to provide one set of complete  ICAs. Additional requirements for ICAs are specified in  sections 23.1529, 25.1529, 27.1529 and 29.1529. These  sections further refer the reader to 14 CFR part 23, Appendix  A; part 25, Appendix H; part 27, Appendix A; and part 29,  Appendix A. Regardless of the appendix referred to, the  requirements in the appendix for the ICA are as follows:  

•	 General: The aircraft ICA must contain instructions  for continued airworthiness for each engine, propeller,  or appliance and the interface of those appliances and  products with the aircraft. •	 Format: The ICA must be in the form of a manual or  manuals appropriate to the data being provided. •	 Content: The manual contents must be in English and  must include the following: •	 Introductory information, including an explanation  of the airplane’s features and data as necessary to  perform maintenance or preventive maintenance •	 A description of the aircraft and its systems,  including engine, propeller, and appliances •	 Basic operating information describing how the  aircraft and its components are controlled •	 Servicing information with such detail as servicing  parts, tank capacities, types of fluid to be used,  applicable pressures for the various systems,  access panels for inspection and servicing,  lubrication points, and types of lubricants to be  used  

The maintenance instructions must include the following  data:  

•	 Recommended schedule for cleaning, inspecting,  adjusting, testing, and lubricating the various parts •	 Applicable wear tolerances  

# SPECIAL AIRWORTHINESS INFORMATION BULLETIN  

This is information only.  Recommendations aren’t mandatory.  

# Introduction  

# Background  

#  

The FAA recommends that owners, operators, and maintenance personnel of the affected airplanes  replace aluminum brackets with steel brackets following Cessna Service Bulletin SEB-25-03 dated  February 17, 2015. To make the determination as to whether the bracket is made of aluminum or  steel, a magnet may be used or look for evidence of iron oxide (rust).

•	 Recommended overhaul periods •	 Details for an inspection program that identifies  both the frequency and the extent of the inspections  necessary to provide for continued airworthiness •	 Troubleshooting information •	 The order and method for proper removal and  replacement of parts •	 Procedures for system testing during ground  operations •	 Diagrams for structural access plates •	 Details for application of special inspection techniques •	 Information concerning the application of protective  treatments after inspection •	 Information relative to the structural fasteners •	 List of any special tools needed  

# Airworthiness Limitations  

The ICA must contain a separate and clearly distinguishable  section titled “Airworthiness Limitations.” Within this section  are mandatory replacement times, structural inspection  interval, and related inspection procedures.  

All of this is included in the initial release of documents  when the aircraft is delivered. However, over the course of  the life of an aircraft, various modifications can and often do  occur. Whether these are as simple as a new cabin to galley  sliding door, or as complex as a navigation related STC, any  major alteration requires that this type of maintenance data  be provided to the owner, so that subsequent maintenance,  inspection, and repair can be properly accomplished. As  aircraft and their systems become more and more complex,  and society continues its preoccupation with litigation for every  incident, it is imperative that the technician have the right  information, that it is current, and that they have the proper  tools, including those required for any special inspection, and  correct replacement parts. If any one of these items is required,  and the technician does not have it accessible, they are in  violation of 14 CFR sections 65.81(b), 43.13(a), and 43.16 if  they attempt to return the aircraft to service.  

Manufacturers may provide this required information in a  variety of different manuals:  

•	 Operating Instructions—The Airplane Flight Manual  (AFM) or the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)  provides the pilot with the necessary information  to properly operate the aircraft. These manuals are  usually listed in the aircraft TCDS, and therefore  are a required item for the aircraft to be considered  airworthy. Note that the AFM is generally serial  number specific, whereas the POH is model specific.  

After 1978, the POHs generally took on both roles. •	 Maintenance Manuals—These manuals are often  referred to as Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM)  or Component Maintenance Manual (CMM).  

The AMM is focused on the entire aircraft and provides the “big  picture” for the maintenance technician. It provides information  concerning the maintenance, including troubleshooting and  repair, of the aircraft and systems on the aircraft.  

The CMM, on the other hand, is focused on a specific  item or component, such as hydraulic pump, generator, or  thrust reverser. It provides the bench mechanic with detail  troubleshooting information and usually serves as an overhaul  manual giving details for disassembly, cleaning, inspection,  repair as necessary, reassembly, and testing in accordance  with approved standards and technical data accepted by  the Administrator. Refer to 14 CFR part 43 section 43.2(a).  When maintenance is done according to the CMM, the  technician must always include the appropriate references  in the maintenance record entry required by 14 CFR part 43,  section 43.9 or 43.11.  

# Service Bulletins (SB)  

Throughout the life of a product (whether TC’d or not),  manufacturing defects, changes in service, or design  improvements often occur. When that happens, the OEM  frequently uses an SB to distribute the information to the  operator of the aircraft. SBs are good information and should  be strongly considered by the owner for implementation to  the aircraft. However, SBs are not required unless they are  referred to in an AD note or if compliance is required as a  part of the authorized inspection program. Refer to section  14 CFR part 39, 39.27.  

# Structural Repair Manual (SRM)  

As the name implies, this manual carries detail information  for the technician concerning an aircraft’s primary and  secondary structure, criteria for evaluating the severity of  the detected damage, determining the feasibility of a repair,  and alignment/inspection information. This manual is usually  a separate manual for large aircraft. On small aircraft, this  information is often included in the AMM.  

# Forms  

# Airworthiness Certificates  

In addition to the registration certificate that indicates the  ownership of an aircraft, an airworthiness certificate indicates  the airworthiness of the aircraft. AC 21-12, Application  for U.S. Airworthiness Certificate, FAA Form 8130-6, is a  comprehensive guide for the completion of the application  form for this certificate. There are two certificates: standard  

# FAA Project Numbering and Designators  

# FAA Project Numbers will use the following format:  

AAnnnnnYY-X Where:  

• AA is the two-letter designator for Project Type – see table 1 below • nnnnn is the integer sequential number for the specified ACO; e.g., 00146 • YY is the two-letter designator for the Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) – see Table 2  below  • X is the one-letter designator for the Product Type – see Table 3 below  

As an example, TC00125AT-A would be a TC project assigned by the Atlanta ACO on a small airplane with the assigned number 00125.

•	 Experimental •	 Special flight permit •	 Provisional  

Airworthiness certificates may be issued by either FAA  personnel or FAA designees. Refer to 14 CFR part 183,  sections 183.31 and 183.33. The certificate must not only  be on board the aircraft (14 CFR part 91, section 91.203(a) (1)), but must also be “displayed at the cabin or flight deck  entrance so that it is legible to the passengers or crew” 14  CFR part 91, (section 91.203(b)). Since the ability to obtain  this certificate is based upon the requirement to inspect the  aircraft to determine that it conforms to type design and is  in condition for safe operation, it can also be revoked by  the FAA if either of those two requirements ceases to exist.  

# Aircraft Registration  

Aircraft must be registered in the United States if the  aircraft is not registered under the laws of a foreign country  and is owned by either a citizen of the United States, a  foreign citizen lawfully admitted to the United States,  or a corporation organized in and doing business under  U.S. laws and primarily based in the United States. This  registration is accomplished by using FAA Form 8050-1,  Aircraft Registration Application. The aircraft registration  form is available online at www.faa.gov. The aircraft owner  can mail in completed copy, and keep a copy of the form as  temporary authority to operate the aircraft after the fee and  evidence of ownership have been mailed or delivered to the  Registry. When carried in the aircraft with an appropriate  current airworthiness certificate or a special flight permit,  a copy of this completed application provides authority to  operate the aircraft in the United States for up to 90 days.  

![Figure 2-19.   Maintenance classification. ](images/95018edc0bbf7b7dca28d43634bb72910a29d03f9787d14a9f8df679a43df465.jpg)  

In addition to the completed application form, the owner must  also submit evidence of ownership (such as a bill of sale)  and a registration fee. A successful review of the application  results in the issuance of AC Form 8050-3, Certificate of  Aircraft Registration. (Note the AC prefix.)  

14 CFR section 91.203(a)(2) requires that either the pink copy  of the application or the actual certificate of registration be  on board the aircraft during its operation.  

If the registration is ever lost or damaged, it may be replaced  by contacting the FAA Aircraft Registration Branch and  providing them with the aircraft specific data, including  make, model, N-number, and serial number. A replacement  certificate fee and an explanation of the reason for the  replacement certificate are also required.  

# Radio Station License  

A radio station license is required if the aircraft is equipped  with radios, and the aircraft is planned to be flown outside  the boundaries of the United States. A radio station license  is not required for aircraft that are operated domestically.  (A major change occurred on February 8, 1996, when the  telecommunications Act of 1996 was signed into law.)  

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) formerly  required that any communication transmitter installed in  aircraft be licensed. These FCC licenses were valid for 5  years. This is not an FAA requirement. FAA inspectors who  conducted ramp inspections and detected an expired radio  station license were not required to notify the FCC, nor  could they issue a violation to the owner/operator. Simply  informing the operator of the expired radio station license  was their only responsibility.  

FSGA 96-06, a Flight Standards Information Bulletin (FSIB)  for General Aviation (FSGA) titled “Elimination of Aircraft  Radio Station Licenses” became effective on July 8, 1996.  Although that FSIB had an effectivity of only 1 year, the  elimination of the requirement for aircraft used only in  domestic operations continues.  

# FAA Form 337—Major Repair and Alteration  

Refer to the current issue of AC 43.9-1, Instructions for  Completion of FAA Form 337 for help completing FAA Form  337, Major Repair and Alteration (Airframe, Powerplant,  Propeller, or Appliance).   [Figure 2-22]  

As the name clearly states, this form is to be used whenever  major repairs or alterations are accomplished on an aircraft.  The only exception would be that 14 CFR part 43, Appendix  B, allows for a certificated repair station to RTS an aircraft  after a major repair by using a signed and dated work order  and a signed maintenance release.  

•	 Information in item 1 comes directly from the aircraft  dataplate, except for the tail number. That is to be  compared to the aircraft registration form.  

•	 Information in item 2 reflects the name and address  listed on AC Form 8050-3, Certificate of Registration. •	 Item 3 is used when there is no existing approved data  for the intended repair or alteration. In that case, the  technician can request that the local FSDO Principal  Maintenance Inspector (PMI) review the data and  then grant a field approval, shown by completing and  signing this area. In many cases, this block is blank  because the technician has found, used, and made  reference to data already approved by the FAA. •	 Item 4—If the repair or alteration is being done  to the aircraft airframe, no entry is required since  the data is identical to that in item 1. However,  if the repair or alteration is being done to an  engine, a propeller, or other appliance, entries must  include the appropriate make, model, and serial  number information. •	 Item 5 should have “X” marked in either the “Repair”  or the “Alteration” column. •	 Item 6—Enter appropriate data as specified and check  the proper box in B. The technician is encouraged to  carefully read the preprinted statement in subparagraph  D prior to signing this section. •	 Item 7 must be completed by the IA or authorized  individual from the repair station. •	 Item 8 (on the reverse side) is for the description of  the work accomplished. It must include a reference  to the approved data used to conduct the required  maintenance.  

The form must be completed at least in duplicate, with the  original provided to the owner/operator and a copy to the local  FSDO within 48 hours of completing the maintenance and  RTS. If the FAA Form 337 is used to document additional  fuel tanks in the cabin or cargo, then an additional copy  must be signed and in the aircraft at all times. Maintenance  facilities and mechanics are encouraged to make a copy for  their own records.  

# Records  

# Making Maintenance Record Entries  

Title 14 of the CFR part 43, sections 43.9 and 43.11 require  the technician to make appropriate entries of maintenance  actions or inspection results in the aircraft maintenance  record. How long those records must be kept is defined in  14 CFR part 91, section 91.417.  

Whenever maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  or alteration work occurs on an aircraft, airframe, aircraft  engine, propeller, appliance, or component part, a maintenance  record entry must be created. The importance of compliance  with this requirement cannot be overemphasized. Complete  and organized maintenance logs for an aircraft can have  significant (and usually positive) effect during the buy/ sell negotiations of an aircraft. On the other hand, poorly  organized and incomplete logs can have a detrimental effect  upon the selling price of an aircraft.  

# Temporary Records—14 CFR Part 91 Section  91.417(a)(1) and (b)(1)  

These are records that must be kept by the owner until  the work is repeated, superseded, or 1 year has transpired  since the work was performed. These are typically records  referring to maintenance, preventive maintenance, alteration,  and all inspections. They include a description of the work  performed (or reference to the FAA-accepted data); the date  of completion; and the name, signature and certificate number  of the person doing the RTS.  

# Permanent Records—14 CFR Part 91, Section  91.417(a)(2) and (b)(2)  

These records must be retained by the owner during the time  they operate the aircraft. They are transferred with the aircraft  at the time of sale. Typically, these are documents relating to  total time in service, current status of life-limited parts, time  since last overhaul, current inspection status, current status of  applicable AD notes, and major alteration forms as required  by 14 CFR part 43, section 43.9.  

# Electronic Records  

During the last 25 years, the field of aviation maintenance has  seen a significant change in the documentation requirements  for aircraft and related parts. Nowhere is that change seen as  revolutionary as the introduction of electronic data and record  retention. Just as the arrival of the personal computer placed  the possibility of the power and versatility of a computer in  the hands of the average person, it made it available to the  maintenance technician. Initially some technicians developed  their own programs for listing data (TCDS, AD notes, and  so forth), but soon commercially available programs were  developed. Basically, these were developed by either one of  the following two groups:  

1.	 Computer literate persons who felt the aviation  industry could benefit from the computer 2.	 Aviation professionals who felt the aviation industry  must benefit from the computer  

Some of those initial programs were either not very  user friendly (if developed by computer wizards) or not  “very sophisticated” (if developed by the maintenance  technician). Today, there is a mixture of these various  database programs. A review of the advertisement section  in any current aviation maintenance magazine offers  

required to conduct proper maintenance, inspections, and  data recording (logbook entries, AD compliance history,  length of component time in service, and so forth) desired  to improve the efficiency of the technician.  

Although some large shops and certified repair stations may  have a separate group of people responsible for “records and  REGISTRATION MARKS  research,” the professional maintenance technician must  N54321 Jackson 47G-4 be aware of the benefits of these systems. Some factors to  5 AUTHORITY AND BASIS FOR ISSUANCE  consider when reviewing a system are:  

•	 What is the typical size of the aircraft that maintenance  is being done on? (i.e., less than 12,500 pounds, more  Exceptions:  than 12,000? Mixed?) None •	 Does the program have built-in templates for the  aircraft being worked on? •	 6 What FAA forms (if any) are available in the program? •	 Does it have a user-friendly template to enter the data  91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, as appropriate, and the aircraft is registered in the United States.  for the form or must data be directly entered onto the  9 Feb 2015  E.J. Smith  •	 Can it calculate weight and balance data? •	 Does it have adequate word search capabilities? •	 Is it networkable? •	 Are the updates sent via U.S. mail or downloaded from  

•	 Can the system handle both single- and multi-engine  aircraft? Fixed and rotary wing? Piston and jet? Can an item removed from an aircraft be tracked? Is the data from this system exportable to other  electronic formats? 3 AIRCRAFT SERIAL  4 CATEGORY  •	 Can it forecast items due for maintenance or  inspection? 3191HG Normal  

Since no program can be considered the best, the technician  must learn all they can about the numerous systems that exist.  Exposure to the pros and cons of these different systems  can be one of the benefits of attending various trade shows,  maintenance seminars, or IA renewal sessions. Continuous  learning and personal improvement is the goal of every  professional maintenance technician.  

Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)  

# Maintenance  

E.J. Smith  The light sport aircraft (LSA) category includes gliders,  airplanes, gyroplanes, powered parachutes, weight-shift and  lighter-than-air aircraft. There are two general types of LSAs:  Special (SLSA) and Experimental (ELSA). The SLSA are  factory built and the ESLA are kit-built. This new category of  aircraft was added to the regulations in 2004. (Refer to 14 CFR  sections 21.190, 65.107, and 91.327, all dated July 27, 2004.)

Just as industry standard specifications have replaced many  of the military standards to define products that are destined  to be part of the Department of Defense (DoD) inventory,  so too have industry standards come into the FAA sights for  documenting certain information. Quality is one example.  The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed  AS 9100 and AS 9110 as auditing standards for aerospace  facilities and specifically repair stations. Likewise, ISO 9001  is being adopted by the FAA as a system of measuring their  performance. Therefore, it was logical that when the FAA  looked to develop the standards for this newest category of  aircraft, they again looked to industry, and this time it was  the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM).

The ASTM developed a comprehensive list of consensus  standards for use by manufacturers, regulators, maintenance  facilities, LSA owners, and service providers. It is unique that  these standards are the first ones in over 100 years to solely  address the issue of recreational aircraft use. It is also the  first complete set of industry consensus standards covering  the design, manufacture, and use of recreational aircraft that  was developed by a non-government agency. The ASTM  committee that developed these LSA standards did so to  ensure the quality of products and services to support both the  national and the international regulatory structures for LSAs.  Over 20 standards have been generated, and more are being  developed to cover this diversity of aircraft. This handbook  only incorporates a review of F2483-05, “Standard Practice  for Maintenance and the Development of Maintenance  Manuals for Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)” a six-page document  comprised of the following 12 sections:  

1.	 Scope 2.	 Referenced Documents 3.	 Terminology 4.	 Significance and Use 5.	 Aircraft Maintenance Manual 6.	 Line Maintenance, Repairs, and Alterations 7.	 Heavy Maintenance, Repairs, and Alterations 8.	 Overhaul 9.	 Major Repairs and Alterations 10.	 Task-Specific Training 11.	 Safety Directives 12.	 Keywords  

The scope of that document is basically twofold:  

•	 To provide guidelines for the qualification necessary  to accomplish various levels of maintenance on LSA. •	 To provide the content and structure of maintenance  manuals for aircraft and their components that are  operated as LSAs.  

Some additional definitions from section 3, Terminology,  that help to better explain the LSA concepts are:  

•	 Annual condition inspection—defined as a detailed  inspection accomplished once a year in accordance  with instructions provided in the maintenance manual  supplied with the LSA. The purpose of this inspection  is to look for any wear, corrosion, or damage that  would cause the LSA not to be in condition for  safe operation.  

•	 Heavy maintenance—any maintenance, inspection,  repair, or alteration a manufacturer has designated that  requires specialized training, equipment, or facilities.  •	 Line maintenance—any repair, maintenance,  scheduled checks, servicing, inspections, or alterations  not considered heavy maintenance that are approved by  the manufacturer and is specified in the manufacturer’s  maintenance manual.  •	 LSA repairman–inspection—a U.S. FAA-certified  LSA repairman with an inspection rating per 14 CFR  part 65. This person is authorized to perform the 100- hour/annual inspection of the aircraft that they own. •	 LSA repairman–maintenance—a U.S. FAA-certified  LSA repairman with a maintenance rating per 14 CFR  part 65. This person is allowed to perform the required  maintenance and can also accomplish the 100-hour/ annual inspection.  •	 Major repair, alteration, or maintenance—any repair,  alteration, or maintenance where instructions to  complete the task are excluded from the maintenance  manual.  •	 Minor repair, alteration, or maintenance—any repair,  alteration, or maintenance where instructions to  complete the task are included in the maintenance  manual.  

The 100-hour inspection is the same as the annual inspection,  except for the interval of time. The requirements for whether  or not the 100-hour inspection is applicable are exactly the  same as the criteria for the standard 100-hour/annual required  of non-LSA aircraft.  

# Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM)  

Although these manuals do not require any FAA approval,  the regulations do require that the manual be developed in  accordance with industry standards. This ASTM sets that  standard by requiring:  

•	 General specifications to be listed, include capacities,  servicing, lubrication, and ground handling •	 An inspection checklist for the annual condition or  100-hour inspection •	 A description of and the instructions for the  maintenance, repair, and overhaul of the LSA engine •	 A description of and the instructions for the  maintenance, repair, and alteration of the aircraft’s  primary structure  

Other items that maintenance procedures must be provided  for are:  

•	 Fuel systems  

•	 Propeller •	 Utility system •	 Instruments and avionics •	 Electrical system •	 Structural repair •	 Painting and coatings  

The Inspection, Repair, and Alterations section must  specifically list any special tools and parts needed to complete  the task, as well as the type of maintenance action (line,  heavy, or overhaul) necessary to accomplish the activity.  Directly associated with that information is the requirement  to specify the level of certification needed to do the job (i.e.,  LSA repairman, A&P, or repair station). The manual may  refer to existing FAA ACs.  

# Line Maintenance, Repairs, & Alterations  

The minimum level of certification necessary to accomplish  line maintenance is LSA inspection. Some typical tasks  considered to be line maintenance are:  

•	 100-hour/annual condition inspection •	 Servicing of fluids •	 Removing and replacing components when instructions  to do so are provided in the maintenance manual –	 Batteries –	Fuel pump–	 Exhaust –	 Spark plugs and wires –	 Floats and skis •	 Repair or alteration of components when specific  instructions are provided in the maintenance manual –	 Patching a hole in the fabric –	 Installation of a strobe light kit  

Heavy maintenance, repairs, and alterations must be  accomplished by either a certified mechanic (A or   $\mathrm{P}$  or  A&P) or an LSA repairman—maintenance who has received  additional “task specific” training. Some examples of this  would be the removal and replacement of complete engine,  cylinder, piston and valve assemblies; primary flight controls;  and landing gear.  

Heavy repair of components or structure can be accomplished  when instructions are provided in the maintenance manual  or other service directed instructions. A few examples of  this activity are:  

•	 Repainting of control surfaces  

•	 Structural repairs •	 Recovering of a dope and fabric  

Heavy alterations of components can be accomplished when  instructions are provided in the maintenance manual or other  service directed instructions. Examples of this activity are  initial installation of skis and installation of new additional  pitot static instruments.  

Overhaul of components can be performed only by the  manufacturer (or someone authorized to perform) of the  LSA or the component to be overhauled. An overhaul  manual is required and must be a separate manual from  the manufacturer’s maintenance manual. Items typically  considered for overhaul are engines, carburetors, starters,  generators, alternators, and instruments.  

# Major Repairs & Alterations  

Another major difference between LSA maintenance and  traditional aircraft maintenance is that FAA Form 337,  Major Repair and Alteration, is not required to document  major repairs and alterations. Instead, any major repair or  alteration that is accomplished after the LSA has gone through  production acceptance testing must be evaluated relative to  the applicable ASTM requirements. After this evaluation has  been accomplished (either by the manufacturer or an entity  approved by them), a written affidavit must be provided  attesting that the LSA still meets the requirements of the  applicable ASTMs.  

The manufacturer (or other approved entity) must provide  written instructions defining the level of certification  necessary to perform the maintenance and also include any  ground test or flight testing necessary to verify that the LSA  complies with the original LSA acceptance test standards,  and is in condition for safe operation. Proper documentation  of this maintenance activity is required to be entered in the  LSA records and is also defined by the manufacturer.  

Task specific training is not required to be FAA approved.  This is solely the responsibility of the manufacturer. Some  examples of this are an engine manufacturer’s overhaul  school or the EAA Sport Air fabric covering school.  

Safety directives are issued against an LSA or component  and are not issued by the FAA, but rather by the original  aircraft manufacturer.  Note:  If the LSA includes a product  that is TC’d by the FAA, the manufacturer is required to  issue a safety directive. Typical instructions within a safety  directive include:  

•	 List of tools required for the task •	 List of parts needed  

•	 Type of maintenance (line, heavy, overhaul) •	 Level of certification needed •	 Detailed instructions and diagrams •	 Inspection and test methods  

Safety directives are mandatory, except for experimental  use LSAs.  

# Chapter 3 Mathematics in Aviation  Maintenance  

# Introduction  

Mathematics is woven into many areas of everyday life.  Performing mathematical calculations with success requires  an understanding of the correct methods, procedures,  practice, and review of these principles. Mathematics may  be thought of as a set of tools. The aviation mechanic needs  these tools to successfully complete the maintenance, repair,  installation, or certification of aircraft equipment.  

Many examples of using mathematical principles by the  aviation mechanic are available. Tolerances in turbine engine  components are critical, making it necessary to measure  within a ten-thousandth of an inch. Because of these close  tolerances, it is important that the aviation mechanic can  make accurate measurements and mathematical calculations.  An aviation mechanic working on aircraft fuel systems  also uses mathematical principles to calculate volumes and  capacities of fuel tanks. The use of fractions and surface  area calculations are required to perform sheet metal repair  on aircraft structures.  

# Whole Numbers  

Whole numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.  Whole numbers can be thought of as counting numbers.  

# Addition of Whole Numbers  

Addition is the process where the value of one number  is added to the value of another. The result is called the  sum. When working with whole numbers, it is important  to understand the principle of the place value. The place  value in a whole number is the value of the position of each  individual digit within the entire number. For example, in the  number 512, the 5 is in the hundreds column, the 1 is in the  tens column, and the 2 is in the ones column. Examples of  place values of three whole numbers are shown in  Figure 3-1 .  

When adding several whole numbers, such as 4,314, 122,  93,132, and 10, align them into columns according to place  value and then add.  

#       97,578  

Therefore, 97,578 is the sum of the four whole numbers.  

# Subtraction of Whole Numbers  

Subtraction is the process where the value of one number  is taken from the value of another. The result is called the  difference. When subtracting two whole numbers, such as  3,461 from 97,564, align them into columns according to  place value and then subtract.  

The difference of the two whole numbers is 94,103.  

# Multiplication of Whole Numbers  

Multiplication is the process of repeated addition. For example,   $4\times3$   is the same as  $4+4+4$  . The result is called the product.  

Example: How many hydraulic system filters do you have  if there are 35 cartons in the supply room and each carton  contains 18 filters?  

Therefore, there are 630 filters in the supply room.  

# Division of Whole Numbers  

Division is the process of finding how many times one  number (called the divisor) is contained in another number  (called the dividend). The result is the quotient, and any  amount left over is called the remainder.  

Example: 218 landing gear bolts need to be divided between  7 aircraft. How many bolts will each aircraft receive?  

simplest form.  

A common denominator can also be found for any group of  fractions by multiplying all the denominators together. This  number is not always the LCD, but it can still be used to add  or subtract fractions.  

In this case, there are 31 bolts for each of the seven aircraft  with one extra remaining.  

# Fractions  

A fraction is a number written in the form   $\mathrm{\%}$   where   $_\mathrm{N}$   is  called the numerator and D is called the denominator. The  fraction bar between the numerator and denominator shows  that division is taking place.  

17	  ${\frac{17}{18}}\,,\;{\frac{2}{3}},\;{\frac{5}{8}}$  Some examples of fractions are:                                                       18      3      8  

The denominator of a fraction cannot be a zero. For  example, the fraction   $\%$   is not allowed, because dividing  by zero is undefined.  

An improper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is  equal to or larger than the denominator. For example,  $\%$   or   $15\%$   are examples of improper fractions.  

# Finding the Least Common Denominator  

To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common  denominator. In math, the least common denominator (LCD)  is generally used. One way to find the LCD is to list the  multiples of each denominator and then choose the smallest  number that they all have in common (can be divided by).  

Example: Add  $\%+\%_{10}$   by finding the LCD.  

Multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and so on. Multiples of  10 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on. Notice that 10, 20, and 30  are in both lists, but 10 is the smallest or LCD. The advantage  of finding the LCD is that the final answer should be in the

Figure 3-1.   Example of place values of whole numbers.  

Example: Add  $\%+\%+\%$    by finding a common denominator.  

A common denominator can be found by multiplying the  denominators  $3\times5\times7$   to get 105.  

$$
\left({\frac{2}{3}}+{\frac{3}{5}}+{\frac{4}{7}}\right)\!\!=\!\!\left({\frac{70}{105}}+{\frac{63}{105}}+{\frac{60}{105}}\right)\!\!=\!\frac{193}{105}\!=\!1\frac{88}{105}
$$  

# Addition of Fractions  

In order to add fractions, the denominators must be the same  number. This is referred to as having “common denominators.”  

Example: Add  $\%$   to  $\%$  

$$
\frac{1}{7}\!+\frac{3}{7}\!=\:\frac{1+3}{7}\!=\frac{4}{7}
$$  

If the fractions do not have the same denominator, then one or  all the denominators must be changed so that every fraction  has a common denominator.  

Example: Find the total thickness of a panel made from   $\%_{2}$  ‑inch thick aluminum, that has a   $\%4\cdot$  -inch thick paint  coating. To add these fractions, determine a common  denominator. The LCD for this example is 1, so only the  first fraction must be changed since the denominator of the  second fraction is already in 64ths.  

$$
\scriptstyle\left({\frac{3}{32}}+{\frac{1}{64}}\right)=\left({\frac{3\times2}{32\times2}}+{\frac{1}{64}}\right)=\left({\frac{6}{64}}+{\frac{1}{64}}\right)=\left({\frac{6+1}{64}}\right)={\frac{7}{64}}
$$  

Therefore,  $\%4$   is the total thickness.  

# Subtraction of Fractions  

To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.  

Example: Subtract  $\%$   from  $1\%_{17}$  

$$
{\frac{10}{17}}-{\frac{2}{17}}={\frac{10-2}{17}}={\frac{8}{17}}
$$  

If the fractions do not have the same denominator, then one or  all the denominators must be changed so that every fraction  has a common denominator.  

Example: The tolerance for rigging the aileron droop of an  airplane is  $\%\;\mathrm{inch}\pm\%$   inch. What is the minimum droop to  which the aileron can be rigged? To subtract these fractions,  first change both to common denominators. The common  denominator in this example is 40. Change both fractions to   $\%$  , as shown, then subtract.  

$$
\scriptstyle\left({\frac{7}{8}}-{\frac{1}{5}}\right)=\left({\frac{7\times5}{8\times5}}-{\frac{1\times8}{5\times8}}\right)=\left({\frac{35}{40}}-{\frac{8}{40}}\right)=\left({\frac{35-8}{40}}\right)={\frac{27}{40}}
$$  

Therefore,  ${}^{27}\!\%$   is the minimum droop.  

# Multiplication of Fractions  

Multiplication of fractions does not require a common  denominator. To multiply fractions, first multiply the  numerators. Then, multiply the denominators.  

Example:  

$$
{\frac{3}{5}}\times{\frac{7}{8}}\times{\frac{1}{2}}={\frac{3\times7\times1}{5\times8\times2}}\,={\frac{21}{80}}
$$  

The use of cancellation when multiplying fractions is a  helpful technique. Cancellation divides out or cancels all  common factors that exist between the numerators and  denominators. When all common factors are cancelled before  the multiplication, the final product is in the simplest form.  

Example:  

$$
\left({\frac{14}{15}}\times{\frac{3}{7}}\right)=\left({\frac{2}{15}}\times{\frac{1}{7}}\right)=\left({\frac{2\times1}{5\times1}}\right)={\frac{2}{5}}
$$  

# Division of Fractions  

Division of fractions does not require a common denominator.  To divide fractions, first change the division symbol to  multiplication. Next, invert the second fraction. Then,  multiply the fractions.  

Example: Divide  $\%$   by  $\%$  

$$
\left({\frac{7}{8}}\div{\frac{4}{3}}\right)=\left({\frac{7}{8}}\times{\frac{3}{4}}\right)=\left({\frac{7\times3}{8\times4}}\right)={\frac{21}{32}}
$$  

Example: In  Figure 3-2 , the center of the hole is in the center  of the plate. Find the distance that the center of the hole is  from the edges of the plate. To find the answer, the length  and width of the plate should each be divided in half. First,  change the mixed numbers to improper fractions:  

Then, divide each improper fraction by 2 to find the center  of the plate.  

$$
{\frac{87}{16}}\div\,{\frac{2}{1}}=\,{\frac{87}{16}}\times{\frac{1}{2}}\!=\,{\frac{87}{32}}\ \mathrm{incl}
$$  

$$
\frac{29}{8}\div\frac{2}{1}\,=\frac{29}{8}\,\times\frac{1}{2}=\frac{29}{16}\mathrm{\incthe}
$$  

Finally, convert each improper fraction to a mixed number:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle\frac{87}{32}=\,\,\,87\div32\,\,=\,2\,\frac{23}{32}\,\,\mathrm{inches}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\frac{29}{16}=\,\,\,29\div16\,\,=\,1\,\frac{13}{16}\,\,\mathrm{inches}}}\end{array}
$$  

Therefore, the distance to the center of the hole from each of  the plate edges is  $2\,\,^{23}\!\!\!/_{32}$   inches and   $1\ {}^{13}\!\!\sqrt{}_{16}$   inches.  

# Reducing Fractions  

A fraction needs to be reduced when it is not in the simplest  form or “lowest terms.” Lowest term means that the numerator  and denominator do not have any factors in common. That  is, they cannot be divided by the same number (or factor).  To reduce a fraction, determine what the common factor(s)  are and divide these out of the numerator and denominator.  For example, when both the numerator and denominator are  even numbers, they can both be divided by 2.  

Example: The total travel of a jackscrew is  ${}^{13}\!\!\sqrt{}_{16}$   inch. If the  travel in one direction from the neutral position is  $\%$   inch,  what is the travel in the opposite direction?  

$$
{\frac{13}{16}}-\,{\frac{7}{16}}=\,{\frac{13-7}{16}}={\frac{6}{16}}
$$  

The fraction  $\%$   is not in lowest terms because the numerator  (6) and the denominator (16) have a common factor of 2. To  reduce   $\%$  , divide the numerator and the denominator by 2.  The final reduced fraction is  $\%$   as shown below.  

$$
{\frac{6}{16}}={\frac{6\div2}{16\div2}}={\frac{3}{8}}
$$  

Therefore, the travel in the opposite direction is  $\%$   inch.  

# Mixed Numbers  

A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and  a fraction.  

# Addition of Mixed Numbers  

To add mixed numbers, add the whole numbers together. Then  add the fractions together by finding a common denominator.  The final step is to add the sum of the whole numbers to the  sum of the fractions for the final answer.  

Example: The cargo area behind the rear seat of a small  airplane can handle solids that are   $4\,\%$   feet long. If the rear  seats are removed, then  $2\ \%$   feet is added to the cargo area.  What is the total length of the cargo area when the rear seats  are removed?  

$$
{\begin{array}{c}{4{\cfrac{3}{4}}+2{\cfrac{1}{3}}\!=\!(4+2)+\!\left(\!\!{\cfrac{\!3}{4}}+{\cfrac{1}{3}}\!\!\right)\!=6+\!\left(\!\!{\cfrac{\!9}{12}}+{\cfrac{\!4}{12}}\!\!\right)\!=6\,{\cfrac{13}{12}}\!=}\\ {7{\cfrac{1}{12}}{\mathrm{~feet~of~cargo~ro m}}}\end{array}}
$$  

# Subtraction of Mixed Numbers  

To subtract mixed numbers, find a common denominator  for the fractions. Subtract the fractions from each other. It  may be necessary to borrow from the larger whole number  when subtracting the fractions. Subtract the whole numbers  from each other. The final step is to combine the final whole  number with the final fraction.  

Example: What is the length of the grip of the bolt shown  in  Figure 3-3?  The overall length of the bolt is   $3\ \%$   inches,  the shank length is   $3\ \%$   inches, and the threaded portion is   $1\%$   inches long. To find the grip, subtract the length of the  threaded portion from the length of the shank.  

#  $3\%\;\mathrm{incidences}-1\%\;\mathrm{incthenes}=\mathrm{group}\;\mathrm{length}$  

To subtract, start with the fractions. Borrowing is necessary  because  $\%$   is larger than  $\%$   (or  $\%$  ). From the whole number  3, borrow 1, which is actually  $16\%$  . After borrowing, the first  mixed number is now  $2\ \%$  . This is because,  $3\;\%=3\;\%=2$   $+\ 1+\%=2+\%6+\%=2\ \%.$  .  

![](images/ae3264db090b3059e5377639295af48dac84d0c1ff8d3ddedc239b188ed93644.jpg)  
Figure 3-2.   Center hole of the plate.  

$$
3{\frac{1}{8}}-1{\frac{5}{16}}=\,3\,{\frac{2}{16}}\,-1{\frac{5}{16}}{=2\,{\frac{18}{16}}-1{\frac{5}{16}}=1{\frac{13}{16}}}
$$  

Therefore, the grip length of the bolt is   $1\%$   inches.  

( Note:  The value for the overall length of the bolt was  given in the example, but it was not needed to solve the  problem. This type of information is sometimes referred to  as a “distracter,” because it distracts from the information  needed to solve the problem.)  

# The Decimal Number System  

# Origin and Definition  

The number system that we use every day is called the  decimal system. The prefix in the word decimal, dec, is a  Latin root for the word “ten.” The decimal system probably  originated from the fact that we have ten fingers (or digits).  The decimal system has ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and  9. The decimal system is a base 10 system and has been in use  for over 5,000 years. A decimal is a number with a decimal  point. For example, 0.515, 0.10, and 462.625 are all decimal  numbers. Like whole numbers, decimal numbers also have  place value. The place values are based on powers of 10, as  shown in  Figure 3-4 .  

# Addition of Decimal Numbers  

To add decimal numbers, they must first be arranged so that  the decimal points are aligned vertically and according to  place value. That is, adding tenths with tenths, ones with  ones, hundreds with hundreds, and so forth.  

Example: Find the total resistance for the circuit diagram  shown in  Figure 3-5 . The total resistance of a series circuit is  equal to the sum of the individual resistances. To find the total  resistance,  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}},$   the individual resistances are added together.  

$$
{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}=2.34+37.5+0.09
$$  

Arrange the resistance values in a vertical column so that the  decimal points are aligned and then add.  

Therefore, the total resistance,  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=39.93$   ohms.  

# Subtraction of Decimal Numbers  

To subtract decimal numbers, they must first be arranged so  that the decimal points are aligned vertically and according  to place value. That is, subtracting tenths from tenths, ones  Example: A series circuit containing two resistors has a total  resistance   $(\bf R_{\mathrm{T}})$   of 37.272 ohms. One of the resistors   $(\mathbf{R}_{1})$    has a value of 14.88 ohms. What is the value of the other  resistor   $\left(\mathbf{R}_{2}\right)$  ?  

$$
{\mathrm{R}}_{2}={\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}-{\mathrm{R}}_{1}=37.272-14.88
$$  

Arrange the decimal numbers in a vertical column so that the  decimal points are aligned and then subtract.  

![](images/a74a2a80dc57005bbd28b119d263c22b9121f096dcf73fdc26519651dd026956.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.   Place values.  

the answer is 1.206.  

Therefore, the second resistor,  $\mathrm{R}_{2}=22.392$   ohms.  

# Multiplication of Decimal Numbers  

To multiply decimal numbers, vertical alignment of the  decimal point is not required. Instead, align the numbers to  the right in the same way that whole numbers are multiplied  (with no regard to the decimal points or place values) and  then multiply. The last step is to place the decimal point in  the correct place in the answer. To do this, count the number  of decimal places in each of the numbers, add the total, and  then assign that number of decimal places to the result.  

Example: To multiply   $0.2\,\times\,6.03$  , arrange the numbers  vertically and align them to the right. Multiply the numbers,  ignoring the decimal points for now.  

6.03 1206	 (ignore the decimal points, for now)  

After multiplying the numbers, count the total number of  decimal places in both numbers. For this example, 6.03 has  2 decimal places and 0.2 has 1 decimal place. Together there  are a total of 3 decimal places. The decimal point for the  answer is placed 3 decimal places from the right. Therefore,  

![](images/d8acf1fdaf02f77a74ecad7428f806756534a74e228731ea48e06035c91937c0.jpg)  
Figure 3-3.   Bolt dimensions.  

Example: Using the formula watts  $=$   amperes  $\times$   voltage, what  is the wattage of an electric drill that uses 9.45 amperes from a  120-volt source? Align the numbers to the right and multiply.  

After multiplying the numbers, count the total number of  decimal places in both numbers. For this example, 9.45 has 2  decimal places and 120 has no decimal place. Together there  are 2 decimal places. The decimal point for the answer is  placed 2 decimal places from the right. Therefore, the answer  is 1,134.00 watts, or simplified to 1,134 watts.

# Division of Decimal Numbers  

Division of decimal numbers is performed the same way as  whole numbers, unless the divisor is a decimal.  

When the divisor is a decimal, it must be changed to a whole  number before dividing. To do this, move the decimal in the  divisor to the right until there are no decimal places. At the  same time, move the decimal point in the dividend to the right  the same number of places. Then divide. The decimal in the  quotient is placed directly above the decimal in the dividend.  

Example: Divide 0.144 by 0.12  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{0.12\ \overline{{)\ 0.144}}}&{=}&{12.\ \overline{{)\ 14.4\ }}}\\ &{}&{\underline{{-\ 12}}}\\ &{}&{\underline{{-\ 24}}}\\ &{}&{0}\end{array}
$$  

Move the decimal in the divisor (0.12) two places to the right.  The result is 12.0. Next, move the decimal in the dividend  (0.144) two places to the right. The result is 14.4. Now divide.  The result is 1.2.  

Example: The wing area of an airplane is 262.6 square feet  and its span is 40.4 feet. Find the mean chord of its wing  using the formula: area  $\div$   span  $=$  mean chord.  

$$
40.4\,\overline{{{\ 262.6}}}\,=\,404.\,\overline{{{\ )2626.0}}}
$$  

Move the decimal in the divisor (40.4) one place to the  right. Next, move the decimal in the dividend (262.6) one  place to the right. Then divide. The mean chord length is  6.5 feet.  

# Rounding Off Decimal Numbers  

Occasionally, it is necessary to round off a decimal number  to some value that is practical to use. For example, a  measurement is calculated to be 29.4948 inches. To use this  measurement, we can use the process of “rounding off.” A  decimal is “rounded off” by keeping the digits for a certain  number of places and discarding the rest. The degree of  accuracy desired determines the number of digits to be  retained. When the digit immediately to the right of the last  retained digit is 5 or greater, round up by 1. When the digit  immediately to the right of the last retained digit is less than  5, leave the last retained digit unchanged.  

Example: An actuator shaft is 2.1938 inches in diameter.  Round to the nearest tenth.  

The digit in the tenths column is a 1. The digit to the right  of the 1 is a 9. Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, “round  up” the 1 to a 2. Therefore, 2.1938 rounded to the nearest  tenth is 2.2.  

Example: The outside diameter of a bearing is 3.1648  centimeters. Round to the nearest hundredth.  

The digit in the hundredths column is a 6. The digit to the  right of the 6 is a 4. Since 4 is less than 5, do not round up  the 6. Therefore, 3.1648 to the nearest hundredth is 3.16.  

Example: The length of a bushing is 3.7487 feet. Round to  the nearest thousandth.  

The digit in the thousandths column is an 8. The digit to  the right of the 8 is a 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to  5, “round up” the 8 to a 9. Therefore, 3.7487 to the nearest  thousandth is 3.749.  

# Converting Decimal Numbers to Fractions  

To change a decimal number to a fraction, “read” the decimal  out loud, and then write it into a fraction just as it is read as  shown below.  

Example: One oversized rivet has a diameter of 0.52 inches.  Convert 0.52 to a fraction. The decimal 0.52 is read as  “fifty-two hundredths.”  

$$
0.52=\frac{52}{100}\xleftarrow{\mathrm{"infty"}}{\mathrm{"windings"}},
$$  

In the above fraction of  $52\!\!\!{\big/}_{100}$  , we can divide 4 into each number  resulting in a fraction of   $13\!\!\!{\big/}{\!}25$  .  

A dimension often appears in a maintenance manual or on  a blueprint as a decimal instead of a fraction. To use the  dimension, it may need to be converted to a fraction. An  aviation mechanic frequently uses a steel rule that is calibrated  in units of   $\%4$   of an inch. To change a decimal to the nearest  equivalent common fraction, multiply the decimal by 64. The  product of the decimal and 64 is the numerator of the fraction  and 64 is the denominator. Reduce the fraction, if needed.  

Example: The width of a hex head bolt is 0.3123 inches.  Convert the decimal 0.3123 to a common fraction to decide  which socket would be the best fit for the bolt head. First,  multiply the 0.3123 decimal by 64:  

$$
0.3123\times64=19.9872
$$  

Next, round the product to the nearest whole number:   $19.98722\approx20$  .  

Use this whole number (20) as the numerator and 64 as the  denominator:  ${}^{20}\%{}_{4}$  .  

Now, reduce  ${}^{20}\%4$   to  $\%$     as 4 is common to both the numerator  and denominator. Therefore, the correct socket would be the   $\%$   inch socket   ${\sqrt[[object Object]]{\ }}^{20}/64$   reduced).  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}{{\frac{3}{8}}\,=\,3\div8=8\,{\overline{{)\,3.000}}}}&{{\mathrm{Thereforone,~}}\,{\frac{3}{8}}\,=\,0.375}\\ {\qquad\qquad\displaystyle{\frac{-24}{60}}}\\ {\qquad\displaystyle{\frac{-56}{40}}}\\ {\qquad\displaystyle{\frac{-40}{0}}}\end{array}}
$$  

Calculator tip: numerator (top number)  $\div$   denominator  (bottom number)  $=$   the decimal equivalent of the fraction.  

Some fractions when converted to decimals produce a  repeating decimal.  

Example:  

Example: When accurate holes of uniform diameter  are required for aircraft structures, they are first drilled  approximately   $\%4$   inch undersized and then reamed to the  final desired diameter. What size drill bit should be selected  for the undersized hole if the final hole is reamed to a diameter  of 0.763 inches? First, multiply the 0.763 decimal by 64.  

$$
0.763\times64=48.832
$$  

Other examples of repeating decimals:  

Next, round the product to the nearest whole number:   $48.832\approx49$  .  

Use this number (49) as the numerator and 64 as the  denominator:  ${^{49}\!\%}_{4}$   is the closest fraction to the final reaming  diameter of 0.763 inches. To determine the drill size for the  initial undersized hole, subtract   $\%4$   inch from the finished  hole size.  

$$
{\frac{49}{64}}\,-{\frac{1}{64}}={\frac{48}{64}}={\frac{3}{4}}
$$  

Therefore, a  $\%$  -inch drill bit should be used for the initial  undersized holes.  

# Converting Fractions to Decimals  

To convert any fraction to a decimal, simply divide the top  number (numerator) by the bottom number (denominator).  Every fraction has an approximate decimal equivalent.  

Example:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}{{\frac{1}{2}}=\,1\div2=2\,{\overline{{)\,1.0\,}}}\,}&{{\mathrm{therefore,~}}{\frac{1}{2}}=\,0.5}\\ {\qquad\qquad{\frac{-\,1.0}{0}}\,}&{}\end{array}}
$$  

# Decimal Equivalent Chart  

Figure 3-6  is a fraction to decimal to millimeter equivalency  chart. Measurements starting at   $\%4$    inch and up to 3 inches  have been converted to decimal numbers and to millimeters.  

# Ratio  

A ratio is the comparison of two numbers or quantities. A  ratio may be expressed in three ways: as a fraction, with a  colon, or with the word “to.” For example, a gear ratio of 5:7  can be expressed as any of the following:  

# Aviation Applications  

Ratios have widespread application in the field of aviation.  

Example: Compression ratio on a reciprocating engine is the  ratio of the volume of a cylinder with the piston at the bottom  of its stroke to the volume of the cylinder with the piston at  the top of its stroke. For example, a typical compression ratio  might be 10:1 (or 10 to 1).  

Aspect ratio is the ratio of the length (or span) of an airfoil to  its width (or chord). A typical aspect ratio for a commercial  airliner might be 7:1 (or 7 to 1).  

Air-fuel ratio is the ratio of the weight of the air to the  weight of fuel in the mixture being fed into the cylinders of  a reciprocating engine. For example, a typical air-fuel ratio  might be 14.3:1 (or 14.3 to 1).  

Glide ratio is the ratio of the forward distance traveled to  the vertical distance descended when an aircraft is operating  without power. For example, if an aircraft descends 1,000 feet  while it travels through the air for two linear miles (10,560  feet), it has a glide ratio of 10,560:1,000 which can be reduced  to 10.56: 1 (or 10.56 to 1).  

Gear ratio is the number of teeth each gear represents when  two gears are used in an aircraft component. In  Figure 3-7 ,  the pinion gear has 8 teeth and a spur gear has 28 teeth. The  gear ratio is 8:28. Using 7 as the LCD, 8:28 becomes 2:7.  

Speed ratio is when two gears are used in an aircraft  component; the rotational speed of each gear is represented  as a speed ratio. As the number of teeth in a gear decreases,  the rotational speed of that gear increases, and vice-versa.  Therefore, the speed ratio of two gears is the inverse (or  opposite) of the gear ratio. If two gears have a gear ratio of  2:9, then their speed ratio is 9:2.  

Example: A pinion gear with 10 teeth is driving a spur gear  with 40 teeth. The spur gear is rotating at  $160\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . Calculate  the speed of the pinion gear.  

$$
{\frac{10\,{\mathrm{tech}}}{40\,{\mathrm{tech}}}}\,=\,{\frac{160\,{\mathrm{rpm}}}{\mathrm{S_{p}}\,({\mathrm{speed}}\,{\mathrm{of}}\,{\mathrm{spinon\,Bar}})}}
$$  

To solve for  $\mathrm{S_{P}}$   multiply  $40\times160$  , then divide by 10. The  speed of the pinion gear is  $640\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

Example: If the cruising speed of an airplane is 200 knots  and its maximum speed is 250 knots, what is the ratio of  cruising speed to maximum speed? First, express the cruising  speed as the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is  the maximum speed.  

$$
\mathrm{Ration}\,=\,\frac{200}{250}
$$  

Next, reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form.  

$$
\mathrm{Qto}\,=\,\frac{200}{250}\,=\,\frac{4}{5}
$$  

Therefore, the ratio of cruising speed to maximum speed is 4:5.  

Another common use of ratios is to convert any given ratio  to an equivalent ratio with a denominator of 1.  

Example: Express the ratio 9:5 as a ratio with a denominator  of 1.  

$$
\mathrm{~R~=~}\frac{9}{5}\;=\;\frac{?}{1}\;\;\;\;\;\mathrm{since}\;9\div5=1.8,\,\mathrm{then}\,\frac{9}{5}\;{=}\frac{1.8}{1}
$$  

Therefore, 9:5 is the same ratio as 1.8:1. In other words, 9  to 5 is the same ratio as 1.8 to 1.  

# Proportion  

A proportion is a statement of equality between two or more  ratios. For example,  

$$
{\frac{3}{4}}\,=\,{\frac{6}{\;8\;}}{\mathrm{~or~}}3{\mathord{:}}4=6{\mathord{:}}8
$$  

This proportion is read as, “3 is to 4 as 6 is to 8.”  

# Extremes and Means  

The first and last terms of the proportion (the 3 and 8 in  this example) are called the extremes. The second and third  terms (the 4 and 6 in this example) are called the means. In  any proportion, the product of the extremes is equal to the  product of the means.  

In the proportion   $2{\cdot}3\,=\,4{\cdot}6$  , the product of the extremes,   $2\times6$  , is 12; the product of the means,  $3\times4$  , is also 12. An  inspection of any proportion shows this to be true.  

# Solving Proportions  

Normally when solving a proportion, three quantities are  known, and the fourth is unknown. To solve for the unknown,  multiply the two numbers along the diagonal and then divide  by the third number.  

Example: Solve for X in the proportion given below.  

$$
{\frac{65}{80}}\,=\,{\frac{X}{100}}
$$  

First, multiply   $65\times100{\colon}65\times100=6500$  Next, divide by   $80\colon6500\div80=81.25$  Therefore,  $\mathrm{X}=81.25\$  .  

Example: An airplane flying 300 miles used 24 gallons of  gasoline. How many gallons will it need to travel 750 miles?  

The ratio here is: “miles to gallons;” therefore, the proportion  is set up as:  

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\mathrm{Miles}}}&{{\displaystyle\frac{300}{24}\,=\,\frac{750}{\mathrm{G}}}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 3-7.   Gear ratio.  

Therefore, to fly 750 miles, 60 gallons of gasoline is required.  

# Percentage  

Percentage means “parts out of one hundred.” The  percentage sign is  ${\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{c o}}}_{0}$  .” Ninety percent is expressed as  $90\%$   $(=90$   parts out of 100). The decimal 0.90 equals  $90\%_{100}$  , or 90  out of 100, or  $90\%$  .  

# Expressing a Decimal Number as a Percentage  

To express a decimal number in percent, move the decimal  point two places to the right (adding zeroes if necessary) and  then affix the percent symbol.  

Example: Express the following decimal numbers as a percent:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{0.90\,=\,90\%}\\ {0.5\,=\,50\%}\\ {1.25\,=\,125\%}\\ {0.335\,=\,33.5\%}\end{array}
$$  

# Expressing a Percentage as a Decimal Number  

Sometimes it may be necessary to express a percentage as  a decimal number. To express a percentage as a decimal  number, move the decimal point two places to the left and  drop the  $\%$   symbol.  

For example: Express the following percentages as decimal  numbers:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{90\%\,=\,0.90}\\ {50\%\,=\,0.50}\\ {5\%\,=\,0.05}\\ {150\%\,=\,1.5}\end{array}
$$  

# Expressing a Fraction as a Percentage  

To express a fraction as a percentage, first change the  fraction to a decimal number (by dividing the numerator by  the denominator), and then convert the decimal number to a  percentage by multiplying by 100 as shown earlier.  

Example: Express the fraction  $\%$   as a percentage.  

$$
\frac{5}{8}=5\div8=0.625=62.5\%
$$  

# Finding a Percentage of a Given Number  

This is the most common type of percentage calculation.  Here are two methods to solve percentage problems: using  algebra or using proportions. Each method is shown next to  find a percent of a given number.  

Example: In a shipment of 80 wingtip lights,   $15\%$   of the  lights were defective. How many of the lights were defective?  

Algebraic Method:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{0.15\times80=\mathrm{~N~}}\\ {12=\mathrm{{N}}}\end{array}
$$  

Therefore, 12 defective lights were in the shipment.  

# Proportion Method:  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{~N~}}{80}\,=\,\frac{15}{100}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{N}\times100=1{,}200}\\ {\mathrm{N}=1{,}200\div100}\\ {\mathrm{N}=12}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{N}=(80\times15)\div100}\\ {\mathrm{N}=12}\end{array}
$$  

# Finding What Percentage One Number is of Another  

Example: A small engine rated at 12 horsepower is found  to be delivering only 10.75 horsepower. What is the motor  efficiency expressed as a percent?  

# Algebraic Method:  

$\Nu\%$   of 12 rated horsepower  $=10.75$   actual horsepower  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{6\times12=10.75}\\ {\mathrm{N}\%=10.75\div12}\\ {\mathrm{N}\%=0.8958}\\ {\mathrm{N}=89.58}\end{array}
$$  

Therefore, the motor efficiency is   $89.58\%$  .  

Proportion Method:  

$$
{\frac{10.75}{12}}=\,{\frac{\mathrm{N}}{100}}
$$  

To solve for   $\Nu\times12=10.75\times100$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{N}=(1{,}075\times100)\div12}\\ {\mathrm{N}=89.58}\end{array}
$$  

Therefore, the motor efficiency is   $89.58\%$  .  

Finding a Number When a Percentage of it is Known Example: Eighty ohms represents   $52\%$   of a microphone’s  total resistance. Find the total resistance of this microphone.  

# Algebraic Method:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{52\%\times\:\mathbf{N}=80}\\ {\mathbf{N}=80\div0.52}\\ {\mathbf{N}=153.846}\end{array}
$$  

The total resistance of the microphone is 153.846 ohms.  

# Proportion Method:  

$$
\frac{80}{\aleph}\,=\,\frac{52}{100}
$$  

To solve for   $\Nu\times52=80\times100

$                           N × 52 = 8,000  $\Nu\times52=8{,}000

$                           N  = 8,000 ÷ 52

                          N  = 153.846 ohms

                              or

                          N  = (80 × 100) ÷ 52

                          N  = 153.846 ohms  

# Positive & Negative Numbers (Signed  Numbers)  

Positive numbers are numbers that are greater than  zero. Negative numbers are numbers less than zero.  [Figure 3-8]  Signed numbers are also called integers.  

# Addition of Positive & Negative Numbers  

The sum (addition) of two positive numbers is positive. The  sum (addition) of two negative numbers is negative. The  sum of a positive and a negative number can be positive or  negative, depending on the values of the numbers. A good  way to visualize a negative number is to think in terms of  debt. If you are in debt by  $\S100$   (or,  $-100)$   and you add   $\S45$  to your account, you are now only  $\S55$   in debt (or  $-55$  ).  

Therefore:  $-100+45=-55$  

Example: The weight of an aircraft is 2,000 pounds. A radio  rack weighing 3 pounds and a transceiver weighing 10 pounds  are removed from the aircraft. What is the new weight? For  weight and balance purposes, all weight removed from an  aircraft is given a minus sign, and all weight added is given  a plus sign.  

$$
2{,}000+-3+-10=2{,}000+-13=1{,}987
$$  

Therefore, the new weight is 1,987 pounds.  

# Subtraction of Positive & Negative Numbers  

To subtract positive and negative numbers, first change the  “–” (subtraction symbol) to a   $\mathfrak{c}\mathfrak{+}\mathfrak{\cdots}$   (addition symbol), and  change the sign of the second number to its opposite (that  is, change a positive number to a negative number or vice  versa). Finally, add the two numbers together.  

Example: The daytime temperature in the city of Denver  was   $6^{\circ}$   below zero   $(-6^{\circ})$  . An airplane is cruising at 15,000  feet above Denver. The temperature at 15,000 feet is   $20^{\circ}$  colder than in the city of Denver. What is the temperature  at 15,000 feet?  

Subtract 20 from  $-6:-6-20=-6+(-20)=-26$  

The temperature is  $-26^{\circ}$  , or  $26^{\circ}$   below zero at 15,000 feet  above the city.  

# Multiplication of Positive & Negative Numbers  

The product of two positive numbers is always positive. The  product of two negative numbers is always positive. The  product of a positive and a negative number is always negative.  

Examples:  	    $3\times6=18\qquad-3\times6=-18\quad-3\times-6=18\quad3\times-6=-18$  

# Division of Positive & Negative Numbers  

The quotient of two positive numbers is always positive. The  quotient of two negative numbers is always positive. The  quotient of a positive and negative number is always negative.  

Examples:   $6\div3=2\qquad-6\div3=-2\qquad-6\div-3=2\qquad6\div-3=-2$  

# Powers  

The power (or exponent) of a number is a shorthand method  of indicating how many times a number, called the base,  is multiplied by itself. For example,   $3^{4}$   is read as   $^{\ast3}$   to the  power of 4.” That is, 3 multiplied by itself 4 times. The 3 is  the base and 4 is the power.  

Examples:  

$$
2^{3}=2\times2\times2=8
$$  

Read “two to the third power equals 8.”  

$$
10^{5}\,{=}\,10\times10\times10\times10\times10\,{\times}\,10\,{\stackrel{}{=}}\,100,000
$$  

Read “ten to the fifth power equals 100,000.”  

# Special Powers  

Squared  

When a number has a power of 2, it is commonly referred to  as “squared.” For example,  $7^{2}$   is read as “seven squared” or  “seven to the second power.” To remember this, think about  how a square has two dimensions: length and width.  

# Cubed  

When a number has a power of 3, it is commonly referred  to as “cubed.” For example,  $7^{3}$   is read as “seven cubed” or  “seven to the third power.” To remember this, think about  how a cube has three dimensions: length, width, and depth.  

# Power of Zero  

Any non-zero number raised to the zero power always equals 1.  

Example:  

$$
7^{0}=1\qquad181^{0}=1\qquad(-24)^{0}=1
$$  

# Negative Powers  

A number with a negative power equals its reciprocal with  the same power made positive.  

Example: The number   $2^{-3}$   is read as   $^{\bullet}2$   to the negative 3rd  power,” and is calculated by:  

$$
2^{-3}\,=\,{\frac{1}{\phantom{-}2^{3}}}\,=\,{\frac{1}{2\times2\times2}}\,=\,{\frac{1}{\phantom{-}8}}
$$  

When using a calculator to raise a negative number to a  power, always place parentheses around the negative number  (before raising it to a power) so that the entire number gets  raised to the power.  

# Law of Exponents  

When multiplying numbers with powers, the powers can be  added as long as the bases are the same.  

Example:  $3^{2}\times3^{4}\,{=}\,(3\times3)\times(3\times3\times3\times3)\,{=}\,3\times3\times3\times3\times3\times3\times3\,{=}\,3^{6}$  or   $3^{2}\times3^{4}=3^{(2+4)}=3^{6}$  

![](images/eedee6e6c2115d9fc74cc527c4a9683db6948c19865ff09c2b3fe23bf17c3580.jpg)  
Figure 3-8.   A scale of signed numbers.  

When dividing numbers with powers, the powers can be  subtracted as long as the bases are the same.  

Example:  

$$
10^{4}\div10^{2}\!=\!\frac{10\!\times\!10\!\times\!10\!\times\!10}{10\!\times\!10}\!=\!\frac{\!\!1\!\oplus\!\times\!\!1\!\oplus\!\times\!10\!\times\!10}{1\!\oplus\!\times\!\!1\!\oplus\!}\!=\!10\!\times\!10\!=\!10^{2}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{~r~}10^{4}\div10^{2}=10^{(4\,-\,2)}=10^{2}
$$  

# Powers of Ten  

Because we use the decimal system of numbers, powers of  ten are frequently seen in everyday applications. For example,  scientific notation uses powers of ten. Also, many aircraft  drawings are scaled to powers of ten.  Figure 3-9  gives more  information on the powers of ten and their values.  

# Roots  

A root is a number that when multiplied by itself a specified  number of times produces a given number.  

The two most common roots are the square root and the cube  root. For more examples of roots, see  Figure 3-10 .  

# Square Roots  

The square root of 25, written as  $\sqrt{25}$  , equals 5. That is, when  the number 5 is squared (multiplied by itself), it produces the  number 25. The symbol  $\sqrt{{~^{~}}^{~}\!\!}$   is called a radical sign. Finding  the square root of a number is the most common application  of roots. The collections of numbers whose square roots  are whole numbers are called perfect squares. The first ten  perfect squares are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.  The square root of each of these numbers is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively.  

For example,  ${\sqrt{36}}=6$   and  ${\sqrt{81}}=9$  

To find the square root of a number that is not a perfect  square, use either a calculator or the estimation method. A  longhand method does exist for finding square roots, but  with the advent of calculators and because of its lengthy  explanation, it is no longer included in this handbook. The  estimation method uses the knowledge of perfect squares to  approximate the square root of a number.  

Example: Find the square root of 31. Since 31 falls between  the two perfect roots 25 and 36, we know that must be  between  $\sqrt{25}$   and  ${\sqrt{36}}.$  . Therefore,  $\sqrt{31}$   must be greater than 5  and less than 6 because  ${\sqrt{25}}=5$   and  ${\sqrt{36}}=6.$  . If you estimate  the square root of 31 at 5.5, you are close to the correct  answer. The square root of 31 is actually 5.568.  

# Cube Roots  

The cube root of 125, written as  $^3\!\sqrt{125}$  , equals 5. That is,  when the number 5 is cubed (5 multiplied by itself then  multiplying the product (25) by 5 again), it produces the  number 125. It is common to confuse the “cube” of a number  with the “cube root” of a number.  

For clarification, the cube of  $27\!=\!27^{3}\!=\!27\times\!27\times\!27\!=\!19{,}683$  However, the cube root of  $27=\sqrt[3]{27}=3$  .  

# Fractional Powers  

Another way to write a root is to use a fraction as the power  (or exponent) instead of the radical sign. The square root of a  number is written with  $\mathbf{a}\,\%$   as the exponent instead of a radical  sign. The cube root of a number is written with an exponent  of   $\%$   and the fourth root with an exponent of  $\%$   and so on.  

$$
{\mathrm{Example:}}{\sqrt{31}}=31^{\lor_{2}}\quad{}^{3}{\sqrt{125}}=125^{\lor_{3}}\quad{}^{4}{\sqrt{16}}=16^{\lor_{4}}
$$  

# Functions of Numbers Chart  

The Functions of Numbers chart found in  Figure 3-10 is included in this chapter for convenience in making  computations. Each column in the chart is listed below, with  new concepts explained.  

•	 Number (N)   •	 N squared   $(\mathbf{N}^{2})$    •	 N cubed   $(\mathbf{N}^{3})$  ) •	 Square root of N   $\mathrm{(\sqrt{N})}$  •	 Cube root of   $\mathrm{{\bf~N}}\,({}^{3}\sqrt{\mathrm{{\bf~N}}})$  

•	 Circumference of a circle with diameter  $\mathbf{\mu}=\mathbf{N}$  .  Circumference is the linear measurement of the  distance around a circle. The circumference is  calculated by multiplying the diameter of the circle  by 3.1416 (3.1416 is the number referred to as pi,  which has the symbol  $\pi$  ). If the diameter of a circle is  10 inches, then the circumference would be:  

$$
10\times3.1416=31.4160.
$$  

•	 Area of a circle with diameter  ${\bf\mu=N}$  . Area of a circle is  the number of square units of measurement contained  in the circle with a diameter of N. The area of a circle  equals   $\pi$   multiplied by the radius squared. This is  calculated by the formula:  $\mathbf{A}\,{=}\,\pmb{\pi}\times\mathbf{r}^{2}$  . Remember that  the radius is equal to one-half of the diameter.  

Example: A flight deck instrument gauge has a round  face that is 3 inches in diameter. What is the area of  the face of the gauge? From  Figure 3-10  for  $\Nu\!=\!3$  , the  answer is 7.0686 square inches. This is calculated by:  

If the diameter of the gauge is 3 inches, then the  radius  $=\%=3/_{2}=1.5$   inches.

# Scientific Notation  

Scientific notation is used as a type of shorthand to express very  large or very small numbers. It is a way to write numbers so  that they do not take up as much space on the page. The format  of a number written in scientific notation has two parts. The  first part is a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than  10 (for example, 2.35). The second part is a power of 10 (for  example,  $10^{6}$  ). The number 2,350,000 is expressed in scientific  notation as  $2.35\times10^{6}$  . It is important that the decimal point  is always placed to the right of the first digit. Notice that very  large numbers always have a positive power of 10 and very  small numbers always have a negative power of 10.  

Example: The velocity of the speed of light is over 186,000  miles per second (mps). This can be expressed as  $1.86\times10^{5}\,\mathrm{mps}$  in scientific notation. The mass of an electron is approximately  0.000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,911 grams. This can  be expressed in scientific notation as  $9.11\times10^{-28}$    grams.  

# Converting Numbers from Standard Notation to  Scientific Notation  

Example: Convert 1,244,000,000,000 to scientific notation  as follows. First, note that the decimal point is to the right  of the last zero. (Even though it is not usually written, it is  assumed to be there.)  

![](images/ddb98cd17701b65fb6dbc6ae53b310b96b6f95d4daa32483c6350f1a8483f672.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.   Functions of numbers.  

![Figure 3-10.   Functions of numbers (continued). ](images/c9990d3c3c98834c499c450653d3ba1543e4d21c555ef5ed83864ef415df0e7f.jpg)  

# Equations  

To change to the format of scientific notation, the decimal  point must be moved to the position between the first and  second digits. In this case, it is between the 1 and the 2. Since  the decimal point must be moved 12 places to the left to get  there, the power of 10 is 12. Remember that large numbers  always have a positive exponent. Therefore, 1,244,000,000,000   $=1.244\times10^{12}$   when written in scientific notation.  

Example: Convert 0.000000457 from standard notation to  scientific notation. To change to the format of scientific  notation, the decimal point must be moved to the position  between the first and second numbers, which in this  case is between the 4 and the 5. Since the decimal point  must be moved 7 places to the right to get there, the  power of 10 is   $^{-7}$  . Remember that small numbers (those  less than one) have a negative exponent. Therefore,   $0.000000457\!=\!4.57\times\!10^{\!-\!7}$   when written in scientific notation.  

# Converting Numbers from Scientific Notation to  Standard Notation  

Example: Convert   $3.68\,\times\,10^{7}$   from scientific notation to  standard notation, as follows. To convert from scientific  notation to standard notation, move the decimal place 7 places to  the right.  $3.68\times10^{7}\!=\!36{,}800{,}000.$   Another way to think about  the conversion is  $3.68\times10^{7}\!=\!3.68\times10{,}000{,}000\!=\!36{,}800{,}000$  .  

Example: Convert   $7.1543\,\times\,10^{-10}$   from scientific notation  to standard notation. Move the decimal place 10 places to  the left:    $7.1543\,\times\,10^{-10}=.00000000071543$  . Another way  to think about the conversion is  $7.1543\times10^{-10}=7.1543\times$   $0.0000000001=0.000000000071543$  

When converting, remember that large numbers always  have positive powers of ten and small numbers always have  negative powers of ten. Refer to  Figure 3-11  to determine  which direction to move the decimal point.  

# Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division  of Scientific Numbers  

To add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers in scientific  notation, change the scientific notation number back to  standard notation. Then add, subtract, multiply or divide the  standard notation numbers. After the computation, change the  final standard notation number back to scientific notation.  

# Algebra  

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letters or  symbols to represent variables in formulas and equations.  

For example, in the equation  $\scriptstyle\mathbf{d}\,=\,\mathbf{V}\,\times\,\mathbf{t},$  , where distance  $=$   velocity   $\times$   time, the variables are: d, v, and t.  

Algebraic equations are frequently used in aviation to show  the relationship between two or more variables. Equations  normally have an equals sign   $(=)$   in the expression.  

Example: The formula   $\mathrm{\bfA}=\pi\times\mathrm{\bfr}^{2}$   shows the relationship  between the area of a circle (A) and the length of the radius  (r) of the circle. The area of a circle is equal to   $\pi$   (3.1416)  times the radius squared. The larger the radius, the larger the  area of the circle.  

# Algebraic Rules  

When solving for a variable in an equation, you can add,  subtract, multiply, or divide the terms in the equation (you do  the same to both sides of the equals sign) to get the variable  onto one side of the equals sign.  

Examples: Solve the following equations for the value N.  

$3\mathrm{N}=21$  To solve for N, divide both sides by 3.   $\begin{array}{c}{3\mathrm{N}\div3=21\div3}\\ {\mathrm{N}=7}\end{array}$   $\Nu+17=59$  To solve for N, subtract 17 from both sides.   $\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{N}+17-17=59-17}\\ {\mathbf{N}=42}\end{array}$   $\Nu-22=100$  To solve for N, add 22 to both sides.   $\begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{N}-22+22=100+22}\\ {\mathrm{N}=122}\end{array}$   $\frac{\mathrm{~N~}}{.5\,.1}=50$       To solve for N, multiply both sides by 5.   $\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{N}\times\mathsf{5}=\mathsf{50}\times\mathsf{5}}\\ {\mathbf{N}=\mathsf{250}}\end{array}$  

# Solving for a Variable  

Another application of algebra is to solve an equation for a  given variable.  

Example: Using the formula given in  Figure 3-12 , find the  total capacitance   $(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{T}})$   of the series circuit containing three  capacitors with  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{C}_{1}=0.1\;\mathrm{microfarad}}\\ &{\mathrm{C}_{2}=0.015\;\mathrm{microfarad}}\\ &{\mathrm{C}_{3}=0.05\;\mathrm{microfarad}}\end{array}
$$  

First, substitute the given values into the formula:  

$$
\mathrm{C_{T}}\,{=}\,\frac{1}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{\mathrm{C_{1}}}{+}\frac{1}{\mathrm{C_{2}}}{+}\frac{1}{\mathrm{C_{3}}}}\,{=}\,\frac{1}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{0.1}{+}\frac{1}{0.015}{+}\frac{1}{0.05}}\,{=}\,\frac{1}{\displaystyle10+66.66+20}
$$  

Therefore,  $\mathrm{C_{T}}=\mathrm{l}/_{96.66}=0.01034$   microfarad. The microfarad  (  ${\cdot}10^{-6}$   farad) is a unit of measurement of capacitance. This is  discussed in greater length in Chapter 12, Electricity.  

# Use of Parentheses  

In algebraic equations, parentheses are used to group numbers  or symbols together. The use of parentheses helps us to  identify the order in which we should apply mathematical  operations. The operations inside the parentheses are always  performed first in algebraic equations.  

Example: Solve the algebraic equation   $\mathrm{\boldmath~X~}\!=\!\ (4\,+\,3)^{2}$  .  First, perform the operation inside the parentheses, which  is,   $4\,+\,3\,=\,7$  . Then complete the exponent calculation   $\mathrm{X}=(7)^{2}=7\times7=49$  .  

When using more complex equations, which may combine  several terms and use multiple operations, grouping the  terms together helps organize the equation. Parentheses, ( ),  are most commonly used in grouping, but you may also see  brackets, [ ]. When a term or expression is inside one of these  grouping symbols, it means that any operation indicated to  be done on the group is done to the entire term or expression.  

# Example:  

Solve the equation  $\Nu=2\times[(9\div3)+(4+3)^{2}]$  . Start with  the operations inside the parentheses ( ), then perform the  operations inside the brackets [ ].  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{N}=2\times[(9\div3)+(4+3)^{2}]}}\\ {{\mathbf{N}=2\times[3+(7)^{2}]}}\end{array}
$$  

First, complete the operations inside the parentheses ( ).  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{{\bf N}=2\times[3+49]}}\\ {{{\bf N}=2\times[52]}}\end{array}
$$  

Second, complete the operations inside the brackets [ ].   $\Nu=104$

# Order of Operation  

In algebra, rules have been set for the order in which  operations are evaluated. These same universally accepted  rules are also used when programming algebraic equations in  calculators. When solving the following equation, the order  of operation is given below:  

$$
\mathrm{N}{=}(62\!-\!54)^{2}\!+\!6^{2}\!-\!4\!+\!3\times[8\!+\!(10\!\div\!2)]\!+\!\sqrt{25}\!+\!(42\!\times\!2)\!\div\!4\!+\!\%
$$  

1. 	 Parentheses. First you must do everything in parentheses,  ( ), starting from the innermost parentheses. If the  expression has a set of brackets, [ ], treat these exactly  like parentheses. If you are working with a fraction, treat  the top as if it was in parentheses and the denominator  as if it were in parentheses, even if there is none shown.  From the equation above, completing the calculation in  parentheses gives the following:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{N}=(8)^{2}+6^{2}-4+3\times[8+(5)]+\sqrt{25}+(84)\div4+\%,}\end{array}
$$  

then  

$$
\mathrm{N}=(8)^{2}+6^{2}-4+3\times[13]+\sqrt{25}+84\div4+\%
$$  

2.	 Exponents. Next, clear any exponents. Treat any roots  (square roots, cube roots, and so forth) as exponents.  Completing the exponents and roots in the equation  gives the following:  

$$
\mathrm{N}\,{=}\,64+36-4+3\times13+5+84\ \div4+\%
$$  

3.	 Multiplication and Division. Evaluate all of the  multiplications and divisions from left to right. Multiply  and divide from left to right in one step. A common  error is to use two steps for this (that is, to clear all of  the multiplication signs and then clear all of the division  signs), but that is not the correct method. Treat fractions  as division. Completing the multiplication and division  in the equation gives the following:  

$$
\mathrm{N}=64+36-4+39+5+21+\%
$$  

4.	 Addition and Subtraction. Evaluate the additions and  subtractions from left to right. Like above, addition  and subtraction are computed left to right in one  step. Completing the addition and subtraction in the  equation gives the following:  

$$
\mathrm{X}=161\,\%
$$  

A commonly used acronym, PEMDAS, is used for  remembering the order of operation in algebra. PEMDAS  is an acronym for parentheses, exponents, multiplication,

division, addition, and subtraction. To remember it, many use  the sentence, “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.” Always  remember, however, to multiply/divide or add/subtract in  one sweep from left to right, not separately.

# Computing Area of Two-Dimensional Solids  

Area is a measurement of the amount of surface of an object.  Area is usually expressed in such units as square inches or  square centimeters for small surfaces or in square feet or  square meters for larger surfaces.  

Figure 3-13  summarizes the formulas for computing the area  of two-dimensional solids.  

# Rectangle  

A rectangle is a four-sided figure with opposite sides of  equal length and parallel to each other.  [Figure 3-14]  All of  the angles are right angles. A right angle is a  $90^{\circ}$   angle. The  rectangle is a very familiar shape in mechanics. The formula  for the area of a rectangle is:  

$$
\mathrm{area}=\mathrm{length}\times\mathrm{width}=1\times\mathrm{w}
$$  

Example: An aircraft floor panel is in the form of a rectangle  having a length of 24 inches and a width of 12 inches. What  is the area of the panel expressed in square inches? First,  determine the known values and substitute them in the formula.  

$\mathbf{a}=1\times\mathbf{w}=24$   inches  $\times\;12$   inches  $=288$   square inches  

# Square  

A square is a four-sided figure with all sides of equal length  and opposite sides are parallel to each other.  [Figure 3-15]  All  angles are right angles. A right angle is a   $90°$   angle. The  formula for the area of a square is:  

$$
\mathrm{area}=\mathrm{length}\times\mathrm{width}=1\times\mathrm{w}
$$  

Since the length and the width of a square are the same value,  the formula for the area of a square can also be written as:  

$$
\mathrm{area}=\mathrm{side}\times\mathrm{side}=\mathrm{s}^{2}
$$  

side measures 25 inches? First, determine the known value  and substitute it in the formula.  

$\mathbf{a}=1\times\mathbf{w}=25$   inches  $\times\,25$   inches  $=625$   square inches  

# Triangle  

A triangle is a three-sided figure. The sum of the three angles  in a triangle is always equal to   $180^{\circ}$  . Triangles are often  classified by their sides. An equilateral triangle has 3 sides  of equal length. An isosceles triangle has 2 sides of equal  length. A scalene triangle has three sides of differing lengths.  

Triangles can also be classified by their angles. An acute  triangle has all three angles less than   $90°$  . A right triangle  has one right angle (a   $90^{\circ}$   angle). An obtuse triangle has  one angle greater than  $90°$  . Each of these types of triangles  is shown in  Figure 3-16 .  

The formula for the area of a triangle is  

$$
{\mathrm{area}}={\mathrm{1}}/{\mathrm{2}}\times({\mathrm{base}}\times{\mathrm{height}})={\mathrm{1}}/{\mathrm{2}}\times({\mathsf{b}}\times{\mathsf{h}})
$$  

Example: Find the area of the obtuse triangle shown in  Figure 3-17 . First, substitute the known values in the  area formula.  

$$
\mathbf{a}=\%\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{h})=\%\times(2^{\prime}6"\times3"2")
$$  

Next, convert all dimensions to inches:  

$3"2"=(3\times12")+2"=(36+2)=38$  

Now, solve the formula for the unknown value:  

$$
\mathsf{a}={}^{1}\!\!/\!_{2}\times(30\;\mathrm{incvarkappa}\times38\;\mathrm{incthen})=570\;\mathrm{s}
$$  

# Parallelogram  

A parallelogram is a four-sided figure with two pairs  of parallel sides.  [Figure 3-18]  Parallelograms do not  necessarily have four right angles.  

The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:  

$$
{\mathrm{area}}={\mathrm{length}}\times{\mathrm{height}}=1\times{\mathrm{h}}
$$  

# Trapezoid  

A trapezoid is a four-sided figure with one pair of parallel  sides.  [Figure 3-19]  The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:  

$$
{\mathrm{area}}={\mathrm{1}}/_{2}\,({\mathrm{base}}_{1}+{\mathrm{base}}_{2})\times{\mathrm{height}}
$$  

Example: What is the area of a square access plate whose  

![Figure 3-13.   Formulas to compute area. ](images/35994f817bfe48e169044b39ff76d6b48a25fbc7c86ae933ff4a68e620153476.jpg)  

Example: What is the area of a trapezoid in  Figure 3-19  whose  bases are 14 inches and 10 inches, and whose height (or  altitude) is 6 inches? First, substitute the known values in  the formula.  

$$
{\mathrm{area}}=\pi\times{\mathrm{radius}}^{2}=\pi\times\mathbf{r}^{2}
$$  

Example: The bore, which is “inside diameter,” of a certain  aircraft engine cylinder is 5 inches. Find the area of the cross  section of the cylinder.  

First, substitute the known values in the formula:  

$$
\mathbf{a}={\boldsymbol{\pi}}\times\mathbf{r}^{2}
$$  

# Circle  

A circle is a closed, curved, plane figure.  [Figure 3-20]  Every  point on the circle is an equal distance from the center of the  circle. The diameter is the distance across the circle (through  the center). The radius is the distance from the center to the  edge of the circle. The diameter is always twice the length  of the radius. The circumference, or distance around, a circle  is equal to the diameter times  $\pi$  .  

$$
{\mathrm{circumference}}={\mathsf{c}}={\mathsf{d}}\,\pi
$$  

![](images/9e38642b4b32c1eb963a4fb6a8191d9e018d8efd30ac83cff742ab4fb01c9e14.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.   Rectangle.  

The diameter is 5 inches, so the radius is 2.5 inches. 

 (diameter  $=$   radius  $\times\,2$  )  

$\mathrm{~a~=~}3.1416\,\times\,(2.5\,\mathrm{~incidences})^{2}\,=\,3.1416\,\times\,6.25$  inches  $=19.635$   square inches  

# Ellipse  

An ellipse is a closed, curved, plane figure and is commonly  called an oval.  [Figure 3-21]  In a radial engine, the  articulating rods connect to the hub by pins, which travel in  the pattern of an ellipse (i.e., an elliptical or orbital path).  

![](images/900966dde889345ae3879fd7d3d8ad22c79470f8f6538d4f347d16b7789f981e.jpg)

# Wing Area  

To describe the shape of a wing  [Figure 3-22] , several terms  are required. To calculate wing area, it is necessary to know  the meaning of the terms “span” and “chord.” The wingspan,  S, is the length of the wing from wingtip to wingtip. The  chord is the average width of the wing from leading edge  to trailing edge. If the wing is a tapered wing, the average  width, known as the mean chord (C), must be known to find  the area. The formula for calculating wing area is:  

area of a win  $\tt_{i}g=s p a t$  n  $\times$   mean chord  

Example: Find the area of a tapered wing whose span is 50  feet and whose mean chord is 6'8". First, substitute the known  values in the formula.  

${\mathsf{a}}={\mathsf{s}}\times{\mathsf{c}}$   $=50$   feet  $\times\;6$   feet 8 inches   		   ( Note:  8 inches  $=\%_{12}$   feet  $=0.67$   feet)   $=50$   feet  $\times\,6.67$   feet   $=333.5$   square feet

Figure 3-18.   Parallelogram.  

# Units of Area  

A square foot measures 1 foot by 1 foot. It also measures 12  inches by 12 inches. Therefore, one square foot also equals  144 square inches (that is,  $12\times12=144$  ). To convert square  feet to square inches, multiply by 144. To convert square  inches to square feet, divide by 144.  

A square yard measures 1 yard by 1 yard. It also measures 3  feet by 3 feet. Therefore, one square yard also equals 9 square  feet (that is,  $3\times3=9$  ). To convert square yards to square feet,  multiply by 9. To convert square feet to square yards, divide  by 9. Refer to  Figure 3-23 , Applied Mathematics Formula  Sheet, for a comparison of different units of area.  

# Computing Volume of Three-Dimensional  Solids  

Three-dimensional solids have length, width, and height.  There are many three-dimensional solids, but the most  common are rectangular solids, cubes, cylinders, spheres,  and cones. Volume is the amount of space within a solid.  Volume is expressed in cubic units. Cubic inches or cubic  centimeters are used for small spaces and cubic feet or cubic  meters for larger spaces.  

# Rectangular Solid  

A rectangular solid is a three-dimensional solid with six  rectangular-shaped sides.  [Figure 3-24]  The volume is the  

![](images/5785293144b7ecfdc8086957e93f77fe869f6606f441fa2adacae63299b98a2a.jpg)

Figure 3-20.   Circle.  

number of cubic units within the rectangular solid. The  formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is:  

$$
{\mathrm{volume}}={\mathrm{length}}\times{\mathrm{width}}\times{\mathrm{height}}=1\times{\mathrm{w}}\times{\mathrm{h}}
$$  

In  Figure 3-24 , the rectangular solid is 3 feet by 2 feet by  2 feet.  

The volume of the solid in  Figure 3-24  is  $=3$   ft  $\times\,2$   ft  $\times$   $2{\mathrm{~ft}}=12$   cubic feet.  

Example: A rectangular baggage compartment measures 5 feet  6 inches in length, 3 feet 4 inches in width, and 2 feet 3 inches  in height. How many cubic feet of baggage will it hold? First,  substitute the known values into the formula.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{v}=1\times\mathrm{w}\times\mathrm{h}}\\ &{\quad=5!6"\times3!4"\times2!3"}\\ &{\quad=5.5\;\mathrm{ft}\times3.33\;\mathrm{ft}\times2.25\;\mathrm{fl}}\\ &{\quad=41.25\;\mathrm{cubic\;free}}\end{array}
$$  

# Cube  

A cube is a solid with six square sides.  [Figure 3-25]  A cube  is just a special type of rectangular solid. It has the same  formula for volume as does the rectangular solid, which is  volume  $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{length}\times\mathbf{width}\times\mathbf{height}=\mathbf{L}\times\mathbf{W}\times\mathbf{H}.$  . Because all  of the sides of a cube are equal, the volume formula for a  cube can also be written as:  

$$
{\mathrm{volume}}={\mathrm{side}}\times{\mathrm{side}}\times{\mathrm{side}}=\mathrm{S}^{3}
$$  

Example: A large, cube-shaped carton contains a shipment  of smaller boxes inside of it. Each of the smaller boxes is   $1~\mathrm{ft}\times1$   ft  $\times\ 1$   ft. The measurement of the large carton is   $3\,\mathrm{ft}\times3\,\mathrm{ft}\times3$   ft. How many of the smaller boxes are in the large  carton? First, substitute the known values into the formula.  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{w}=1\times\mathrm{w}\times\mathrm{h}}\\ {\mathrm{\}=3~\mathrm{ft}\times3~\mathrm{ft}\times3~\mathrm{ft}}\end{array}
$$  

![](images/15ccea29fab529af2c4ddf0ada097161c257a5a4253c0901ba81d3cbda96accb.jpg)  

Figure 3-21.   Ellipse.  

Since each of the smaller boxes has a volume of 1 cubic foot,  the large carton holds 27 boxes.  

# Cylinder  

A solid having the shape of a can, a length of pipe, or a barrel  is called a cylinder.  [Figure 3-26]  The ends of a cylinder are  identical circles. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:  

$$
{\mathrm{volume}}=\pi\times{\mathrm{radius}}^{2}\times{\mathrm{height~of~the~cylinder}}=\pi\operatorname{r}^{2}\times\mathbf{h}
$$  

One of the most important applications of the volume of  a cylinder is finding the piston displacement of a cylinder  in a reciprocating engine. Piston displacement is the total  volume (in cubic inches, cubic centimeters, or liters) swept  by all of the pistons of a reciprocating engine as they move  in one revolution of the crankshaft. The formula for piston  displacement is given as:  

![](images/da537dfcfdf304a4ecca3ead4d10be931019ca34528d6cf50aa7a29682546634.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.   Wing planform.  

The bore of an engine is the inside diameter of the cylinder.  The stroke of the engine is the length the piston travels inside  the cylinder.  [Figure 3-27]  

Example: Find the piston displacement of one cylinder in a  multi-cylinder aircraft engine. The engine has a cylinder bore  of 5.5 inches and a stroke of 5.4 inches. First, substitute the  known values in the formula.  

$$
\mathrm{v}=\pi\times\mathrm{r}^{2}\times\mathrm{h}=(3.1416)\times(5.5\div2)^{2}\times(5.4)
$$  

inches. For an eight-cylinder engine, then the total engine  displacement would be:  

Total displacement for 8 cylinders  $=8\times128.29=$  1026.32 cubic inches of displacement  

# Sphere  

A solid having the shape of a ball is called a sphere. 

 [Figure 3-28]  A sphere has a constant diameter. The radius 

 (r) of a sphere is one-half of the diameter (d). The formula  for the volume of a sphere is given as:  

The piston displacement of one cylinder is 128.29 cubic

# Cone  

A solid with a circle as a base and with sides that gradually  milli (10 ) One thousandth of taper to a point is called a cone.  [Figure 3-29]  The formula  One millionth of for the volume of a cone is given as: One billionth of

$$  

# Units of Volume  

Since all volumes are not measured in the same units, it is  Positive  necessary to know all the common units of volume and how  Exponents they are related to each other. For example, the mechanic  10 6 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 1,000,000 may know the volume of a tank in cubic feet or cubic inches,  5 but when the tank is full of gasoline, they are interested in  how many gallons it contains. Refer to  Figure 3-23 , Applied  Mathematics Formula Sheet, for a comparison of different  units of volume. 100  

# Computing Surface Area of Three- 0 1 Dimensional Solids

concept from that of volume. For example, surface area is the  amount of sheet metal needed to build a rectangular fuel tank  while volume is the amount of fuel that the tank can contain.  

# Rectangular Solid  

The formula for the surface area of a rectangular solid 

 [Figure 3-24]  is given as:  

$=

$   $\begin{array}{r l}&{2\times\left[\mathrm{(width}\times\mathrm{length)}+\mathrm{(width}\times\mathrm{height)}+\mathrm{(length}\times\mathrm{height)}\right]}\\ &{=2\times\left[\mathrm{(w}\times\mathrm{l)}+\mathrm{(w}\times\mathrm{h)}+\mathrm{(l}\times\mathrm{h)}\right]}\end{array}$  

# Cube

$$  

Example: What is the surface area of a cube with a side  measure of 8 inches?  

Surface area	 = 6 × (side × side)   $\begin{array}{l}{=6\times(\mathrm{side}\times\mathrm{side})}\\ {=6\times\mathrm{S}^{2}=6\times8^{2}=6\times64}\\ {=384~\mathrm{square}\;\mathrm{incleqslant}}\end{array}

$$  

Figure 3-30  summarizes the formulas for computing the  volume and surface area of three-dimensional solids.  

# Trigonometric Functions  

Trigonometry is the study of the relationship between the  angles and sides of a triangle. The word trigonometry comes  from the Greek trigonon, which means three angles, and  metro, which means measure.  

# Right Triangle, Sides, and Angles  

In  Figure 3-31 , notice that each angle is labeled with a  capital letter. Across from each angle is a corresponding  side, each labeled with a lower case letter. This triangle is  a right triangle because angle C is a  $90°$   angle. Side “a” is  

![](images/002f93976a87c84de027eed5cd1c82d9e7c8256b587df21da0f282a360efe027.jpg)

opposite from angle A and is sometimes referred to as the  “opposite side.” Side “b” is next to, or adjacent to, angle  A and is therefore referred to as the “adjacent side.” Side  “c” is always across from the right angle and is referred to  as the “hypotenuse.”  

# Sine, Cosine, and Tangent  

The three primary trigonometric functions and their  abbreviations are: sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent  (tan). These three functions can be found on most scientific  calculators. The three trigonometric functions are actually  ratios comparing two of the sides of the triangle as follows:  

Cosine (cos) of angle  $\mathrm{A}={\frac{\mathrm{adjacent~side~(side~b)}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse~(side~c)}}}$  

Tangent (tan) of angle  $\mathrm{A}={\frac{\mathrm{opposite~side~(side~a)}}{\mathrm{adjacent~side~(side~b)}}}$  adjacent side (side b)  

Example: Find the sine of a  $30^{\circ}$   angle.  

# Calculator Method:  

Using a calculator, select the “sin” feature, enter the number  30, and press “enter.” The calculator should display the  answer as 0.5. This means that when angle A equals  $30^{\circ}$  , then  the ratio of the opposite side (a) to the hypotenuse (c) equals  0.5 to 1, so the hypotenuse is twice as long as the opposite  side for a  $30^{\circ}$   angle. Therefore, sin   $30^{\circ}=0.5$  .  

# Trigonometry Table Method:  

When using a trigonometry table, find  $30^{\circ}$   in the first column.  Next, find the value for sin   $30^{\circ}$   under the second column  marked “sine” or “sin.” The value for sin   $30^{\circ}$   should be 0.5.  

# Pythagorean Theorem  

The Pythagorean Theorem is named after the ancient Greek  mathematician, Pythagoras   $(\sim\!500\;\mathrm{B.C.})$  . This theorem is used  to find the third side of any right triangle when two sides are  known. The Pythagorean Theorem states that   $\mathsf{a}^{2}+\mathsf{b}^{2}=\mathsf{c}^{2}$  .  [Figure 3-32]  Where “c”  $=$   the hypotenuse of a right triangle, “a”  is one side of the triangle and “b” is the other side of the triangle.  

Example: What is the length of the longest side of a right  triangle, given the other sides are 7 inches and 9 inches?  The longest side of a right triangle is always side “c,” the  hypotenuse. Use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the  length of side “c” as follows:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{{\mathsf{a}}^{2}+{\mathsf{b}}^{2}={\mathsf{c}}^{2}}\\ &{7^{2}+9^{2}={\mathsf{c}}^{2}}\\ &{49+81={\mathsf{c}}^{2}}\\ &{\qquad130={\mathsf{c}}^{2}}\\ &{\qquad{\mathsf{c}}={\sqrt{130}}=11.4\;{\mathrm{incelse}}}\end{array}}
$$  

Therefore, side   $\"c"=11.4$   inches.  

Example: The cargo door opening in a military airplane is  a rectangle that is  $5\%$   feet tall by 7 feet wide. A section of  square steel plate that is 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall by 1 inch  thick must fit inside the airplane. Can the square section of  steel plate fit through the cargo door? It is obvious that the  square steel plate will not fit horizontally through the cargo  door. The steel plate is 8 feet wide and the cargo door is only  7 feet wide. However, if the steel plate is tilted diagonally,  will it fit through the cargo door opening?  

The diagonal distance across the cargo door opening can be  calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem where “a” is the  cargo door width, “b” is the cargo door height, and “  $\mathbf{\ddot{c}}^{\prime\prime}$   is the  diagonal distance across the cargo door opening.  

$$
\mathsf{a}^{2}+\mathsf{b}^{2}=\mathsf{c}^{2}
$$

The diagonal distance across the cargo door opening is 8.9  feet, so the 8-foot wide square steel plate fits diagonally  through the cargo door opening and into the airplane.  

# Measurement Systems  

# Conventional (U.S. or English) System  

Our conventional (U.S. or English) system of measurement is  part of our cultural heritage from the days when the thirteen  colonies were under British rule. It started as a collection  of Anglo-Saxon, Roman, and Norman-French weights and  measures. For example, the inch represents the width of the  thumb and the foot is from the length of the human foot.  Tradition holds that King Henry I decreed that the yard should  be the distance from the tip of his nose to the end of his thumb.  Since medieval times, commissions appointed by various  English monarchs have reduced the chaos of measurement  by setting specific standards for some of the most important  units. Some of the conventional units of measure are: inches,  feet, yards, miles, ounces, pints, gallons, and pounds. Because  the conventional system was not set up systematically, it  contains a random collection of conversions. For example,   $1\;\mathrm{mle}=5{,}280$   feet and 1 foot  $=12$   inches.  

# Metric System  

The metric system, also known as the International System  of Units (SI), is the dominant language of measurement used  

![](images/fa9ac80a641ca7c19e85e75e153a4827381b2e7c8f5e30f7ce9c8ee114c1b538.jpg)

today. Its standardization and decimal features make it well- suited for engineering and aviation work.  

The metric system was first envisioned by Gabriel Mouton,  Vicar of St. Paul’s Church in Lyons, France. The meter is  the unit of length in the metric system, and it is equal to one  ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North  Pole. The liter is the unit of volume and is equal to one cubic  decimeter. The gram is the unit of mass and is equal to one  cubic centimeter of water.  

All of the metric units follow a consistent naming scheme,  which consists of attaching a prefix to the unit. For example,  since kilo stands for 1,000, one kilometer equals 1,000 meters.  Centi is the prefix for one hundredth, so one meter equals one  hundred centimeters. Milli is the prefix for one thousandths  and one gram equals one thousand milligrams. Refer to  Figure 3-33  for the names and definitions of metric prefixes.  

# Measurement Systems & Conversions  

The United States primarily uses the conventional (U.S.  or English) system, although it is slowly integrating the  metric system (SI). A recommendation to transition to the  metric system within ten years was initiated in the 1970s.  However, this movement lost momentum, and the United  States continues to use both measurement systems. Therefore,  information to convert between the conventional (U.S.  or English) system and the metric (SI) system has been  included in  Figure 3-23 , Applied Mathematics Formula  Sheet. Examples of its use are as follows:  

To convert inches to millimeters, multiply the number of  inches by 25.4.  

$$
\mathrm{Example:~}20\ \mathrm{lnech}=20\times25.4=508\ \mathrm{mm}
$$  

To convert ounces to grams, multiply the number of ounces  by 28.35.  

Example: 12 ounces  $=12\times28.35=340.2$   grams  

![](images/42c8e477a75d80a5bc39b79450f433e2e40b21ac7c0ea7ff37b0accdcc485dcb.jpg)  
Figure 3-32.   Pythagorean Theorem.  

# The Binary Number System  

The binary number system has only two digits: 0 and 1. The  prefix in the word “binary” is a Latin root for the word “two”  and its use was first published in the late 1700s. The use of  the binary number system is based on the fact that switches  or valves have two states: open or closed (on/off).  

Currently, one of the primary uses of the binary number  system is in computer applications. Information is stored as  a series of 0s and 1s, forming strings of binary numbers. An  early electronic computer, ENIAC (Electronic Numerical  Integrator and Calculator), was built in 1946 at the University  of Pennsylvania and contained 17,000 vacuum tubes, along  with 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays, 6,000  manual switches and 5 million soldered joints. Computers  obviously have changed a great deal since then, but are still  based on the same binary number system. The binary number  system is also useful when working with digital electronics  because the two basic conditions of electricity, on and off,  can be represented by the two digits of the binary number  system. When the system is on, it is represented by the digit  1, and when it is off, it is represented by the digit 0.  

# Place Values  

The binary number system is a Base-2 system. That is,  the place values in the binary number system are based on  powers of 2. An 8-bit binary number system is shown in  Figure 3-34 .  

# Converting Binary Numbers to Decimal Numbers  

To convert a binary number to a decimal number, add up the  place values that have a 1 (place values that have a zero do  not contribute to the decimal number conversion).  

Example: Convert the binary number 10110011 to a decimal  number. Using the place value chart in  Figure 3-35 , add up  the place values of the ‘1s’ in the binary number (ignore the  place values with a zero in the binary number).  

The binary number 10110011

 	  $=128+0+32+16+0+0+2+1$  = 128 + 0 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1  

 	  $=179$   in the decimal number system  

# Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers  

To convert a decimal number to a binary number, the place  values in the binary system are used to create a sum of  numbers that equal the value of the decimal number being  converted. Start with the largest binary place value and  subtract from the decimal number. Continue this process  until all of the binary digits are determined.  

Example: Convert the decimal number 233 to a binary number.  

Start by subtracting 128 (the largest place value from the  8-bit binary number) from 233.  

$233-128=105$  	 A “1” is placed in the first binary 	 	 digit space: 1XXXXXXX.  

Continue the process of subtracting the binary number  place values:  

$105-64=41\$  105 – 64 = 41 	 A “1” is placed in the second binary 	 	 digit space: 11XXXXXX.  $41-32=9$  41 – 32 = 9 	 A “1” is placed in the third binary 	 	 digit space: 111XXXXX.  

![Figure 3-33.   Names and definitions of metric prefixes. ](images/168b294675bc54c4611bc41f3741fc51bcf57960e8638541271cabeae7ae32bf.jpg)  

Since 9 is less than 16 (the next binary place value), a “0” is  placed in the fourth binary digit space, 1110XXXX.  

$9-8=1$  9 – 8 = 1 	 A “1” is placed in the fifth binary 	 	 digit space: 11101XXX  

Since 1 is less than 4 (the next binary place value), a 0 is  placed in the sixth binary digit space: 111010XX.  

Since 1 is less than 2 (the next binary place value), a 0 is  placed in the seventh binary digit space: 1110100X.  

$$
1-1=0
$$  

The decimal number 233 is equivalent to the binary number  11101001, as shown in  Figure 3-36 .  

Three additional decimal number to binary number  conversions are shown in  Figure 3-36.

# Chapter 4 Aircraft Drawings  

# Introduction  

The exchange of ideas is essential to everyone, regardless of  their vocation or position. This exchange is usually carried on  by oral or written word; but under some conditions, the use of  these alone is impractical. The aviation industry discovered  that it could not depend entirely upon written or spoken  words for the exchange of ideas, because misunderstanding  and misinterpretation arose frequently. A written description  of an object can be changed in meaning just by misplacing  a comma, and the meaning of an oral description can be  completely changed by using a wrong word. To avoid these  possible errors, drawings are used to describe objects. For  this reason, drawing is the draftsman’s language.  

Drawing, in the aviation industry, is a method of conveying  ideas concerning the construction or assembly of objects.  This is done with the help of lines, notes, abbreviations, and  symbols. It is important that the aviation mechanic who is  to make or assemble the object understands the meaning of  the different lines, notes, abbreviations, and symbols that  are used in a drawing. (See the “Lines and Their Meanings”  section of this chapter.)  

# Computer Graphics  

From the early days of aviation, development of aircraft,  aircraft engines, and other components relied heavily on  aircraft drawings. For most of the   $20^{\mathrm{th}}$   century, drawings  were created on a drawing “board” with pen or pencil and  paper. With the introduction and advancement of computers  in the later decades of the   $20^{\mathrm{th}}$   century, the way drawings  are created changed dramatically. Computers were used  not only to create drawings, but they were being used to  show items in “virtual reality,” from any possible viewing  angle. Further development of computer software programs  allowed for assembling of separately created parts to check  for proper fit and possible interferences. Additionally, with  nearly instantaneous information sharing capability through  computer networking and the Internet, it became much easier  for designers to share their work with other designers and  manufacturers virtually anytime, anywhere in the world.  Using new computer-controlled manufacturing techniques,  it became possible to design a part and have it precisely  manufactured without ever having shown it on paper. New  terms and acronyms became commonplace. The more  common of these terms are:  

•	 Computer Graphics—drawing with the use of a  computer  

•	 Computer Aided Design (CAD)—where a computer  is used in the design of a part or product •	 Computer Aided Design Drafting (CADD)—where a  computer is used in the design and drafting process  •	 Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)—where a  computer is used in the manufacturing of a part or  product  •	 Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)—where a  computer is used in the engineering of a part or product  

As computer hardware and software continue to evolve, a  greater amount of CAE is completed in less time, at lower  cost. In addition to product design, some of the other uses  of CAE are product analysis, assembly, simulations, and  maintenance information.  [Figure 4-1]  

CATIA, ProEngineer, Solid Works, and Unigraphics are some  of the more popular CAD software packages used for aircraft  design and manufacturing. Most airframe manufacturers use  CATIA software to design their aircraft. The complete aircraft  is designed and assembled in the software package before  it is manufactured. Drawings of all parts of the aircraft are  available and can be accessed using the computer software.  Drawings are no longer limited to 1, 2, or 3 views. Drawings  from every angle can easily be accessed by using the  computer model of the part or product. Technicians can access  drawings and aircraft manuals on laptops or even mobile  devices when performing maintenance on the shop floor.  

# Purpose & Function of Aircraft Drawings  

Drawings and prints are the link between the engineers who  design an aircraft and the workers who build, maintain, and  repair it. A print may be a copy of a working drawing for  an aircraft part or group of parts, or for a design of a system  or group of systems. They are made by placing a tracing of  the drawing over a sheet of chemically-treated paper and  exposing it to a strong light for a short period of time. When  the exposed paper is developed, it turns blue where the light  has penetrated the transparent tracing. The inked lines of the  tracing, having blocked out the light, show as white lines  on a blue background. With other types of sensitized paper,  prints may have a white background with colored lines or a  colored background with white lines.  

Drawings created using computers may be viewed on the  computer monitor or printed out in “hard copy” by use of an  ink jet or laser printer. Larger drawings may be printed by use  of a plotter or large format printer. Large printers can print  drawings up to 42 inches high with widths up to 600 inches  by use of continuous roll paper.  [Figure 4-2]  

# Care & Use of Drawings  

Drawings should be handled carefully as they are both  expensive and valuable. Open drawings slowly and carefully  to prevent tearing of the paper. When the drawing is open,  smooth out the fold lines instead of bending them backward.  

To protect drawings from damage, never spread them on the  floor or lay them on a surface covered with tools or other  objects that may make holes in the paper. Hands should be  free of oil, grease, or other unclean matter that can soil or  smudge the print.  

Never make notes or marks on a print, as they may confuse  others and lead to incorrect work. Only authorized individuals  are permitted to make notes or changes on prints, and they  must sign and date any changes they make.  

When finished with a drawing, fold and return it to its proper  place. Prints are folded originally in an appropriate size for  filing. Care should be taken so that the original folds are  always used.  

# Types of Drawings  

Drawings must give information such as size and shape of  the object and all its parts, specifications for material to be  used, how the material is to be finished, how the parts are to  be assembled, and any other information essential to making  and assembling the object. Drawings may be divided into  three classes: detail, assembly, and installation.  

# Detail Drawing  

A detail drawing is a description of a single part, describing  bylines, notes, and symbols the specifications for size, shape,  material, and methods of manufacture to be used in making  the part. Detail drawings are usually rather simple. When  single parts are small, several detail drawings may be shown  on the same sheet or print.  [Figure 4-3]  

# Assembly Drawing  

An assembly drawing is a description of an object made up  of two or more parts.  [Figure 4-4]  It describes the object’s  size and shape. Its primary purpose is to show the relationship  of the various parts. An assembly drawing is usually more  complex than a detail drawing and is often accompanied by  detail drawings of various parts.  

![](images/51cd03d66c160e0ddc755da7c9e99714e5f3b335d05a5b860734e3e0c90b20b5.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.   Computer graphics work station.  

# Installation Drawing  

An installation drawing is one that includes all necessary  information for a part or an assembly in the final installed  position in the aircraft. It shows the dimensions necessary  for the location of specific parts with relation to the other  parts and reference dimensions that are helpful in later work  in the shop.  [Figure 4-5]  

# Sectional View Drawings  

A section or sectional view is obtained by cutting away part  of an object to show the shape and construction at the cutting  plane. The part or parts cut away are shown by using section  (crosshatching) lines. Types of sections are described in the  following paragraphs.  

# Full Section  

A full section view is used when the interior construction  or hidden features of an object cannot be shown clearly by  exterior views. For example,  Figure 4-6  is a sectional view  of a cable connector and shows the internal construction of  the connector.  

# Half Section  

In a half section, the cutting plane extends only halfway  across the object, leaving the other half of the object as an  exterior view. Half sections are used with symmetrical objects  to show both the interior and exterior.  Figure 4-7  is a half  sectional view of a Capstan servo.  

# Revolved Section  

A revolved section drawn directly on the exterior view shows  the shape of the cross section of a part, such as the spoke  of a wheel. An example of a revolved section is shown in  Figure 4-8 .  

![](images/d0c3b664b15cc3d18abd599eea75f1e4d1fab353673516a514d0d6ed2efc7694.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.   Large format printer.  

# Removed Section  

A removed section illustrates parts of an object. It is drawn  like revolved sections, except it is placed at one side and  often drawn to a larger scale than the view indicated to bring  out pertinent details.  

Figure 4-9  is an illustration of removed sections. Section  A-A shows the cross-sectional shape of the object at cutting  plane line A-A. Section B-B shows the cross-sectional shape  at cutting plane line B-B. These sectional views are drawn  to the same scale as the principal view.  

# Title Blocks  

Every print must have some means of identification.  This is provided by a title block.  [Figure 4-4A]  The title  block consists of a drawing number and certain other data  concerning the drawing and the object it represents. This  information is grouped in a prominent place on the print,  usually in the lower right-hand corner. Sometimes the title  block is in the form of a strip extending almost the entire  distance across the bottom of the sheet.  

Although title blocks do not follow a standard form as far  as layout is concerned, all of them present essentially the  following information:  

1.	 A drawing number to identify the print for filing  purposes and to prevent confusing it with any  other print. 2.	 The name of the part or assembly 3.	 The drawing scale 4.	 The date 5.	 The name of the firm 6.	 The name of the draftsmen, the checker, and the person  approving the drawing  

# Drawing or Print Numbers  

All prints are identified by a number that appears in a number  block in the lower right corner of the title block. It may also  be shown in other places—such as near the top border line,  in the upper right corner, or on the reverse side of the print at  both ends—so that the number shows when the print is folded  or rolled. The purpose of the number is quick identification of  a print. If a print has more than one sheet and each sheet has  the same number, this information is included in the number  block, indicating the sheet number and the number of sheets  in the series.  [Figure 4-4B]  

# Reference and Dash Numbers  

Reference numbers that appear in the title block refer you  to the numbers of other prints. When more than one detail  is shown on a drawing, dash numbers are used. Both parts  would have the same drawing number plus an individual  number, such as 40267-1 and 40267-2.  

In addition to appearing in the title block, dash numbers  may appear on the face of the drawing near the parts they  identify. Dash numbers are also used to identify right-hand  and left-hand parts.  

In aircraft, many parts on the left side are like the  corresponding parts on the right side but in reverse. The left- hand part is always shown in the drawing. The right-hand  part is called for in the title block. Above the title block a  notation is found, such as: 470204-1LH shown; 470204-2RH  opposite. Both parts carry the same number, but the part  called for is distinguished by a dash number. Some prints  have odd numbers for left-hand parts and even numbers for  right-hand parts.  

# Universal Numbering System  

The universal numbering system provides a means of  identifying standard drawing sizes. In the universal  numbering system, each drawing number consists of six or  seven digits. The first digit is always 1, 2, 4, or 5 and indicates  the size of the drawing. The number 1 indicates a drawing of   $8\%\times11"$  ; number 2 indicates an  $11"\times17"$   drawing; number  4 represents a drawing of   $17"\times22"$  ; and 5 indicates a width  of between 17 and 36 inches but on a continuous roll. Letters  are also used (and becoming more prevalent) with the most  common letters being A through E. The letter A is  $8\%\times11"$  ,  B is   $11"\times17"$  , C is   $17"\times22"$  , D is  $22"\times34"$   and E is   $34"$   $\times\,44"$  . There are additional letters, such as D1 at  $24"\times36"$  ,  E1 at   $30"\times42"$   and additional sizes unique to even larger  formats but generally reserved for inter-company operations.  

The remaining digits identify the drawing. Many firms have  modified this basic system to conform to their needs. The  letter or number depicting the standard drawing size may be  

![](images/e6860c764e3462c8e98221e33e6ef68e1dae59838ce8c4a60c05fd5bbb7e04e2.jpg)

Figure 4-6.   Sectional view of a cable connector.  

prefixed to the number, separated from it by a dash. Other  numbering systems provide a separate box preceding the  drawing number for the drawing size identifier. In another  modification of this system, the part number of the depicted  assembly is assigned as the drawing number.

# Drawing Standards  

Drawing standards cover such items as paper sizes, notes,  numbering systems, geometric dimensions and tolerances,  abbreviations, welding symbols, roughness symbols, and  electrical symbols. These standards cover metric and inch  measurements, as well as computer-drafting standards.  Different standards for drawings are used in industry and  some of the more common ones are published by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  

# Bill of Material  

A list of the materials and parts necessary for the fabrication  or assembly of a component or system is often included  on the drawing. The list is usually in ruled columns that  

![](images/38e0067e271fac8718e4d22d4ece5772dcd7bc59f8f261de43736d817de90db1.jpg)

Figure 4-9.   Removed sections.  

provide the part number, name of the part, material the part  is to be constructed of, the quantity required, and the source  of the part or material. A typical bill of material is shown  in  Figure 4-4C . On drawings that do not have a bill of  material, the data may be indicated directly on the drawing.  On assembly drawings, each item is identified by a number  in a circle or square. An arrow connecting the number with  the item assists in locating it in the bill of material.  

# Other Drawing Data  

# Revision Block  

Revisions to a drawing are necessitated by changes in  dimensions, design, or materials. The changes are usually  listed in ruled columns either adjacent to the title block or at  one corner of the drawing. All changes to approved drawings  must be carefully noted on all existing prints of the drawing.  

When drawings contain such corrections, attention is directed  to the changes by lettering or numbering them and listing those  changes against the symbol in a revision block.  [Figure 4-4D] The revision block contains the identification symbol, the  date, the nature of the revision, the authority for the change,  and the name of the draftsman who made the change.  

To distinguish the corrected drawing from its previous  version, many firms are including, as part of the title block,  a space for entering the appropriate symbol to designate that  the drawing has been changed or revised.  

# Notes  

Notes are added to drawings for various reasons. Some of these  notes refer to methods of attachment or construction. Others  give alternatives, so that the drawing can be used for different  styles of the same object. Still others list modifications that  are available. Notes may be found alongside the item that  they refer to. If the notes are lengthy, they may be placed  elsewhere on the drawing and identified by letters or numbers.  Notes are used only when the information cannot be conveyed  in the conventional manner or when it is desirable to avoid  crowding the drawing.  Figure   $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{A}}-{\mathcal{A}}E$   illustrates one method  of depicting notes.  

When the note refers to a specific part, a light line with an  arrowhead leads from the note to the part. If it applies to more  than one part, the note is worded to eliminate ambiguity as  to the parts it pertains to. If there are several notes, they are  generally grouped together and numbered consecutively.  

# Zone Numbers  

Zone numbers on drawings are like the numbers and letters  printed on the borders of a map. They help locate a point.  To find a point, mentally draw horizontal and vertical lines  from the letters and numerals specified; the point where these  lines intersect is the area sought.  Figure  $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{A}}-{\mathcal{A}}F$   shows the zone  numbers on a drawing.  

Use the same method to locate parts, sections, and views  on large drawings, particularly assembly drawings. Parts  numbered in the title block can be located on the drawing  by finding the numbers in squares along the lower border.  Zone numbers read from right to left.  

# Station Numbers & Location Identification on  Aircraft  

A numbering system is used on large assemblies for aircraft  to locate stations, such as fuselage frames. Fuselage station  185 indicates a location that is 185 inches from the datum of  the aircraft. The measurement is usually taken from the nose  or zero station, but in some instances, it may be taken from  the firewall or some other point chosen by the manufacturer.  Just as forward and aft locations on aircraft are made by  reference to the datum, locations left and right of the aircraft’s  longitudinal axis are made by reference to the buttock line  and are called butt stations. Vertical locations on aircraft are  made in reference to the waterline.  

The same station numbering system is used for wing and  stabilizer frames. The measurement is taken from the  centerline or zero station of the aircraft.  Figure 4-10  shows  use of the fuselage stations (FS), waterline locations (WL),  and left and right buttock line locations (RBL and LBL).  

# Allowances & Tolerances  

When a given dimension on a print shows an allowable  variation, the plus  $(+)$   figure indicates the maximum, and the  minus  $(-)$   figure the minimum allowable variation. The sum  of the plus and minus allowance figures is called tolerance.  [Figure 4-4G]  For example, using  $0.225+0.0025-0.0005$  , the  plus and minus figures indicate the part is acceptable if it is not  more than 0.0025 larger than the 0.225 given dimension, or not  more than 0.0005 smaller than the 0.225 dimension. Tolerance  in this example is 0.0030 (0.0025 max plus  $0.0005\,\mathrm{min}$  ).  

If the plus and minus allowances are the same, you will find  them presented as   $0.225\pm0.0025$  . The tolerance would then  be 0.0050. Allowance can be indicated in either fractional or  decimal form. When very accurate dimensions are necessary,  decimal allowances are used. Fractional allowances are  sufficient when precise tolerances are not required. Standard  tolerances of –0.010 or  $-\%_{2}$     may be given in the title block  of many drawings, to apply throughout the drawing.  

# Finish Marks  

Finish marks are used to indicate the surface that must  be machine finished. Such finished surfaces have a better  appearance and allow a closer fit with adjoining parts. During  the finishing process, the required limits and tolerances must  be observed. Do not confuse machined finishes with those of  paint, enamel, chromium plating, and similar coating.  

# Scale  

Some drawings are made the same size as the drawn part;  reflecting a scale of 1:1. Other scales may be used. However,  when drawings are made on a computer, drawing sizes may  be easily increased (zoom in) or decreased (zoom out). Some  electronic printers have the same capability. Furthermore,  when a 1:1 copy of a print is made, the copy size may differ  slightly from that of the original. For accurate information,  refer to the dimensions shown on the drawing.  [Figure 4-4H]  

# Application  

When shown near or in the title block, application may  refer to a specific aircraft, assembly, sub-assembly or  unique application. For example, in  Figure 4-4A  the title  block indicates the bracket assembly is for a Roll Servo  installation for an S-Tec Auto Pilot installation. If this  drawing pertained to a B95 Aircraft equipped with an Aero- Tech air conditioning system and the bracket illustrated was  unique to that installation, the title block would provide that  application information.  The title block may indicate Bracket  Assy., Roll Servo, with Aero-Tech air conditioner (Model  AT103-1) installed.  

# Methods of Illustration  

# Applied Geometry  

Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with  lines, angles, figures, and certain assumed properties in  space. Applied geometry, as used in drawings, makes use  of these properties to accurately and correctly represent  objects graphically. In the past, draftsmen utilized a variety  of instruments with various scales, shapes, and curves to  make their drawings. Today, computer software graphics  programs show drawings at nearly any scale, shape, and curve  imaginable, outdating the need for additional instruments.  

Several methods are used to illustrate objects graphically.  The most common are orthographic projections, pictorial  drawings, diagrams, and flowcharts.  

# Orthographic Projection Drawings  

To show the exact size and shape of all the parts of complex  objects, several views are necessary. This is the system used  in orthographic projection.  

In orthographic projection, there are six possible views of  an object, because all objects have six sides—front, top,  bottom, rear, right side, and left side.  Figure 4-11A  shows  an object placed in a transparent box, hinged at the edges.  The projections on the sides of the box are the views as seen  looking straight at the object through each side. If the outlines  of the object are drawn on each surface of the box, and the  box is then opened  [Figure 4-11B]  to lay flat  [Figure 4-11C] ,  the result is a six-view orthographic projection.  

It is seldom necessary to show all six views to portray an  object clearly; therefore, only those views necessary to  illustrate the required characteristics of the object are drawn.  One-, two-, and three-view drawings are the most common.  Regardless of the number of views used, the arrangement  is generally as shown in  Figure 4-11 , with the front view  as principal view. If the right-side view is shown, it will be  to the right of the front view. If the left-side view is shown,  it will be to the left of the front view. The top and bottom  views, if included, will be shown in their respective positions  relative to the front view.  

One-view drawings are commonly used for objects of  

![](images/158b3386ab189d65237ad9254deb34928dbad38bddc9fb08133c1820cb3f180a.jpg)  
Figure 4-10.   Station numbers and location identification on aircraft.  

uniform thickness, such as gaskets, shims, and plates. A  dimensional note gives the thickness as shown in  Figure 4-12 .  One-view drawings are also commonly used for cylindrical,  spherical, or square parts if all the necessary dimensions can  be properly shown in one view. When space is limited and  two views must be shown, symmetrical objects are often  represented by half views, as illustrated in  Figure 4-13 .  

Aircraft drawings seldom show more than two principal or  complete views of an object. Instead, there will be usually one  complete view and one or more detail views or sectional views.  

Detail View  

A detail view shows only a part of the object, but in greater  detail and to a larger scale than the principal view. The  part that is shown in detail elsewhere on the drawing is  usually encircled by a heavy line on the principal view.  [Figure 4-14]  The principal view shows the complete object,  while the detail view is an enlarged drawing of a portion of  the object.  

# Pictorial Drawings  

A pictorial drawing is like a photograph.  [Figure 4-15] It shows an object as it appears to the eye, but it is not  satisfactory for showing complex forms and shapes. Pictorial  drawings are useful in showing the general appearance  of an object and are used extensively with orthographic  projection drawings. Pictorial drawings are used in Aircraft  Maintenance Manuals (AMM), Structural Repair Manuals  (SRM), and Illustrated Parts Catalogues (IPC). Four types  of pictorial drawings used frequently by aircraft engineers  and technicians are: perspective, isometric, oblique, and  exploded view.  

# Perspective Drawings  

A perspective view shows an object as it appears to an  observer.  [Figure 4-16A]  It most closely resembles the way  an object would look in a photograph. Because of perspective,  some of the lines of an object are not parallel and therefore  the actual angles and dimensions are not accurate.  

# Isometric Drawings  

An isometric view uses a combination of the views of an  orthographic projection and tilts the object forward so  that portions of all three views can be seen in one view.  [Figure 4-16B]  This provides the observer with a three- dimensional view of the object. Unlike a perspective drawing  where lines converge and dimensions are not true, lines in  an isometric drawing are parallel and dimensioned as they  are in an orthographic projection.  

Oblique Drawings  

An oblique view is like an isometric view, except for one  distinct difference. In an oblique drawing, two of the three  drawing axes are always at right angles to each other.  [Figure 4-16C]  

# Exploded View Drawings  

An exploded view drawing is a pictorial drawing of two or  more parts that fit together as an assembly. The view shows  the individual parts and their relative position to the other  parts before they are assembled.  [Figure 4-17]  

Exploded view drawings are often used in IPCs that are used  to order parts. The exploded view drawing has numbers and  the numbers correspond to a list of part numbers. Exploded  views are also used in Maintenance Instruction Manuals  (MIM) for the assembly and repair of aircraft components.  These drawings are often accompanied by notes that explain  the assembly process.  

# Diagrams  

A diagram may be defined as a graphic representation of  an assembly or system, indicating the various parts and  expressing the methods or principles of operation. There are  many types of diagrams; however, those that the aviation  mechanic is concerned with during the performance of their  job may be grouped into four classes or types: installation,  schematic, block, and wiring diagrams.  

# Installation Diagrams  

Figure 4-18  is an example of an installation diagram.  This is a diagram of the installation of the flight guidance  control components of an aircraft. It identifies each of the  components in the systems and shows their location in the  aircraft. Each number (1, 2, 3, and 4) on the detail shows the  location of the individual flight guidance system components  within the flight deck of the aircraft. Installation diagrams are  used extensively in aircraft maintenance and repair manuals,  and are invaluable in identifying and locating components  and understanding the operation of various systems.  

# Schematic Diagrams  

Schematic diagrams do not indicate the location of the  individual components in the aircraft nor do they show  the actual size and shape of the components, but rather  locate components with respect to each other within the  system. Schematics show the principle of operation of an  aircraft system and are often used for troubleshooting and  training purposes.  

Figure 4-19  illustrates a schematic diagram of an aircraft air  conditioning system. High-speed bleed air from the engine is  

![](images/2fc1636fa06b2fda86656e14019c71017a1654eaeb5131372838b85a9c161972.jpg)  
Figure 4-11.   Orthographic projection.  

combined with cold air in the mixing chamber and distributed  via a manifold to various parts of the aircraft.  

Note that each line is coded for ease of reading and tracing  the flow. Each component is identified by name, and its  location within the system can be ascertained by noting  the lines that lead into and out of the unit. Schematic  diagrams and installation diagrams are used extensively in  aircraft manuals.  

Block Diagrams Block diagrams are used to show a simplified relationship of a  

![](images/01fd26ef98a7991bcc552513243aaf4017517b1805502933f0ebddefcf6d1675.jpg)

more complex system of components.  [Figure 4-20]  Individual  components are drawn as a rectangle (block) with lines  connecting it to other components (blocks) that it interfaces  with during operation.  

# Wiring Diagrams  

Wiring diagrams show the electrical wiring and circuitry,  coded for identification, of all the electrical appliances and  devices used on aircraft.  [Figure 4-21]  These diagrams, even  for relatively simple circuits, can be quite complicated. For  

![](images/84117f14383c70977ef26f00f0836956e2f89db3fe02cf579177860d895b9437.jpg)  
Figure 4-15.   Pictorial drawing.  

technicians involved with electrical repairs and installations,  a thorough knowledge of wiring diagrams and electrical  schematics is essential.  

# Flowcharts  

Flowcharts are used to illustrate a sequence or flow of  events. There are two types of flow charts most frequently  

![](images/2aeb2736999af2ffc18ce81e0da87dfeb57c9eeb562b6bec4d76fab040f1da68.jpg)

Figure 4-16.   (A) Perspective,   $(B)$   isometric, and   $(C)$   oblique drawings.  

used in the aviation industry: troubleshooting flowcharts  and logic flowcharts.  

Troubleshooting Flowchart Troubleshooting flowcharts are frequently used for the  detection of faulty components. They often consist of a  3 2 1 series of yes or no questions. If the answer to a question  

![](images/2d91f2f6f5608e2bf1a3957b9ebbc5661e6e3715639ccfef0ca4384853d99dcc.jpg)  
Figure 4-17.   Exploded view drawing.  

is yes, one course of action is followed. If the answer is  no, a different course of action is followed. In this simple  manner, a logical solution to a problem may be achieved.  Figure 4-22  shows a flow chart to determine the repair  options for a composite structure.  

# Logic Flowchart  

Another type of flowchart, developed specifically for analysis  of digitally-controlled components and systems, is the logic  flowchart.  [Figure 4-23]  A logic flowchart uses standardized  symbols to indicate specific types of logic gates and their  relationship to other digital devices in a system. Since digital  systems make use of binary mathematics consisting of 1s and  0s, voltage or no voltage, a light pulse or no light pulse, and  so forth, logic flowcharts consist of individual components  that take an input and provide an output that is either the same  as the input or opposite. By analyzing the input or multiple  inputs, it is possible to determine the digital output or outputs.

Figure 4-18.   Example of an installation diagram (flight guidance components).  

# Lines and Their Meanings  

Every drawing is composed of lines. Lines mark the  boundaries, edges, and intersection of surfaces. Lines are  used to show dimensions and hidden surfaces and to indicate  centers. Obviously, if the same kind of line is used to show  these variations, a drawing becomes a meaningless collection  of lines. For this reason, various kinds of standardized lines  are used on aircraft drawings.  [Figure 4-24]  Examples of  correct line uses are shown in  Figure 4-25 .  

Most drawings use three widths, or intensities, of lines:  thin, medium, or thick. These lines may vary somewhat  on different drawings, but there is a noticeable difference  between a thin and a thick line, with the width of the medium  line somewhere between the two.  

# Centerlines  

Centerlines are made up of alternate long and short  dashes. They indicate the center of an object or part of an  object. Where centerlines cross, the short dashes intersect  

![](images/caae9283bc08d2f09f034e055887df5cc61898a96696744bd83bff558f6cf977.jpg)  
Figure 4-19.   Schematic diagram of an air conditioning system for a B737 NG.  

symmetrically. In the case of very small circles, the  centerlines may be shown unbroken.  

# Dimension Lines  

A dimension line is a light solid line, broken at the midpoint  for insertion of measurement indications, and having opposite  pointing arrowheads at each end to show origin and termination  of a measurement. They are generally parallel to the line that  the dimension is given for, placed outside the outline of the  object, and between views if more than one view is shown.  

All dimensions and lettering are placed so that they read from  left to right. The dimension of an angle is indicated by placing  the degree of the angle in its arc. The dimensions of circular  parts are always given in terms of the diameter of the circle  and are usually marked with the letter D or the abbreviation  DIA following the dimension. The dimension of an arc is  given in terms of its radius and is marked with the letter R  following the dimension. Parallel dimensions are placed so  that the longest dimension is farthest from the outline and the  shortest dimension is closest to the outline of the object. On  a drawing showing several views, the dimensions are placed  upon each view to show its details to the best advantage.  

In dimensioning distances between holes in an object,  dimensions are usually given from center to center rather than  from outside to outside of the holes. When several holes of  various sizes are shown, the desired diameters are given on a  leader followed by notes indicating the machining operations  for each hole. If a part is to have three holes of equal size,  equally spaced, this information is explicitly stated. For  holes, the angle of countersinking and the diameters are  given.  [Figure 4-26]  

The dimensions given for tolerances signify the amount  of clearance allowable between moving parts. A positive  allowance is indicated for a part that is to slide or revolve  upon another part. A negative allowance is one given for a  force fit. Whenever possible, the tolerance and allowances for  desired fits conform to those set up in the American Standard  for Tolerances, Allowances, and Gauges for Metal Fits. The  classes of fits specified in the standard may be indicated on  assembly drawings.  

# Extension Lines  

Extensions are used to extend the line showing the side or  edge of a figure for placing a dimension to that side or edge.  They are very narrow and have a short break where they  extend from the object and extend a short distance past the  arrow of the dimensioning line.  

# Sectioning Lines  

Sectioning lines indicate the exposed surfaces of an object in  a sectional view. They are generally thin full lines, but may  vary with the kind of material shown in section.  

# Phantom Lines  

Phantom lines indicate the alternate position of parts of the  object or the relative position of a missing part. They are  composed of one long and two short evenly spaced dashes.  

![](images/977e6caae1fd6c02fb3f96fc4271c12e58f44c9f46681ccc75483fd1b76cc466.jpg)

precision work, sizes are given in decimals. Diameters and  depths are given for counterbored holes. For countersunk

Figure 4-21.   Wiring diagram.  

referred to as dash lines.  

# Break Lines  

Break lines indicate that a portion of the object is not shown  on the drawing. Short breaks are made by solid, freehand  lines. For long breaks, solid ruled lines with zigzags are used.  Shafts, rods, tubes, and other such parts that have a portion  of their length broken out have the ends of the break drawn  as indicated in  Figure 4-25 .  

# Leader Lines  

Leader lines are solid lines with one arrowhead. They  indicate a part or portion that a note, number, or other  reference applies.  

# Outline or Visible Lines  

The outline or visible line is used for all lines on the drawing  representing visible lines on the object. This is a medium-to- wide line that represents edges and surfaces that can be seen  when the object is viewed directly.  

# Stitch Lines  

Stitch lines are used to indicate the stitching or sewing lines  on an article and consists of a series of very short dashes,  approximately half the length of dash or hidden lines, evenly  spaced. Long lines of stitching may be indicated by a series  of stitch lines connected by phantom lines.  

# Hidden Lines  

Hidden lines indicate invisible edges or contours. Hidden  lines consist of short dashes evenly spaced and are frequently  

![](images/9a0e7bd41bb7cec5b487325680a088a73fdaf66bd1f43d3c480fd8f59d0b9886.jpg)  
Figure 4-22.   Troubleshooting flowchart.  

# Cutting Plane and Viewing Plane Lines  

Cutting plane lines indicate the plane where a sectional view  of the object is taken. In  Figure 4-25 , plane line A indicates  the plane that section AA is taken. Viewing plane lines  indicate the plane from where a surface is viewed.  

# Drawing Symbols  

The drawings for a component are composed largely of  symbols and conventions representing its shape and material.  Symbols are the shorthand of drawing. They graphically  portray the characteristics of a component with a minimal  amount of drawing.  

# Material Symbols  

indicated symbolically if its exact specification is shown  elsewhere on the drawing. In this case, the more easily  drawn symbol for cast iron is used for the sectioning, and  the material specification is listed in the bill of materials or  indicated in a note.  Figure 4-27  illustrates a few standard  material symbols.  

# Shape Symbols  

Symbols can be used to excellent advantage when needed to  show the shape of an object. Typical shape symbols used on  aircraft drawings are shown in  Figure 4-28 . Shape symbols are  usually shown on a drawing as a revolved or removed section.  

# Electrical Symbols  

Electrical symbols represent various electrical devices  rather than an actual drawing of the units.  [Figure 4-29] Having learned what the various symbols indicate, it  becomes relatively simple to look at an electrical diagram  and determine what each unit is, what function it serves, and  how it is connected in the system.  

# Reading and Interpreting Drawings  

Aircraft technicians do not necessarily need to be accomplished  in making drawings. However, they must have a working  knowledge of the information that is to be conveyed to them.  They most frequently encounter drawings for construction  and assembly of new aircraft and components, during  modifications, and for making repairs.  

A drawing cannot be read all at once any more than a whole  page of print can be read at a glance. Both must be read  one line at a time. To read a drawing effectively, follow a  systematic procedure.  

Upon opening a drawing, read the drawing number and the  description of the article. Next, check the model affected,  the latest change letter, and the next assembly listed. Having  determined that the drawing is the correct one, proceed to  read the illustration(s).  

In reading a multiview drawing, first get a general idea of  the shape of the object by scanning all the views. Then select  one view for a more careful study. By referring back and  forth to the adjacent view, it is possible to determine what  each line represents.  

Each line on a view represents a change in the direction of  a surface, but another view must be consulted to determine  what the change is. For example, a circle on one view may  mean either a hole or a protruding boss, as in the top view  of the object in  Figure 4-30 . Looking at the top view, we see  two circles. However, the other view must be consulted to  Section line symbols show the kind of material from which  the part is to be constructed. The material may not be  

![](images/9810cb3bfe8c955902182803306795704cb81508c591bb8954a601aebd3f5c02.jpg)  
Figure 4-23.   Logic flowchart.  

determine what each circle represents.  

A glance at the other view tells us that the smaller circle  represents a hole, and the larger circle represents a protruding  boss. In the same way, the top view must be consulted to  determine the shape of the hole and the protruding boss.  

It can be seen from this example that one cannot read a print  by looking at a single view when more than one view is given.  Two views do not always describe an object and when three  views are given, all three must be consulted to be sure the  shape has been read correctly.  

After determining the shape of an object, determine its size.  Information on dimensions and tolerances is given so that  certain design requirements may be met. Dimensions are  indicated by figures either with or without the inch mark. If no  inch mark is used, the dimension is in inches. It is customary  to give part dimensions and an overall dimension that gives  the greatest length of the part. If the overall dimension is  

![](images/a19760dda30ea160e33d3949a219d74a1b7666c9f6dff7e81dbefff98159a675.jpg)  
Figure 4-24.   The meaning of lines.  

missing, it can be determined by adding the separate part  dimensions. Many drawings used for new aircraft and  components are now using the metric system and millimeter  (mm) is the unit used for these drawings.  

Drawings may be dimensioned in decimals or fractions. This  is especially true about tolerances. Instead of using plus and  minus signs for tolerances, many figures give the complete  dimension for both tolerances. For example, if a dimension is  2 inches with a plus or minus tolerance of 0.01, the drawing  would show the total dimensions as:  

![](images/0a9b3d7de2b7acaba75d2821e61aa1c5875592e63ab45b1831bbdf917874e69c.jpg)  
Figure 4-26.   Dimensioning holes.  

A print tolerance (usually found in the title block) is a  general tolerance that can be applied to parts where the  dimensions are noncritical. Where a tolerance is not shown  on a dimension line, the print tolerance applies.  

To complete the reading of a drawing, read the general notes  and the content of the material block, find the various changes  incorporated, and read the special information given in or  

![](images/5f3b99380090a2b114b8f65e561bed1e373edd7147a941a5c34e4d4543686e92.jpg)

near views and sections.  

# Drawing Sketches  

A sketch is a simple rough drawing that is made rapidly  and without much detail. Sketches may take many forms— from a simple pictorial presentation to a multi-view  orthographic projection.  

Just as aircraft technicians need not be highly skilled in  creating drawings, they need not be accomplished artists.  However, in many situations, they need to prepare a drawing  to present an idea for a new design, a modification, or a repair  method. The medium of sketching is an excellent way of  accomplishing this.  

The rules and conventional practices for making mechanical  drawings are followed to the extent that all views needed  to portray an object accurately are shown in their proper  relationship. It is also necessary to observe the rules for  correct line use and dimensioning.  [Figures  $_{\textrm{\tiny A-24}}$    and  4-25]  

# Sketching Techniques  

To make a sketch, first determine what views are necessary  to portray the object. Then block in the views using light  construction lines. Next, complete the details, darken the  object outline, and sketch extension and dimension lines.  Complete the drawing by adding notes, dimensions, title,  date, and when necessary, the sketcher’s name. The steps in  making a sketch of an object are illustrated in  Figure 4-31 .  

# Basic Shapes  

Depending on the complexity of the sketch, basic shapes may  be drawn in freehand or by use of templates. If the sketch  is quite complicated or the technician is required to make  frequent sketches, use of a variety of templates and other  drafting tools is highly recommended.  

# Repair Sketches  

A sketch is frequently drawn for repairs or for use in  manufacturing a replacement part. Such a sketch must  provide all necessary information to those who must make  the repair or manufacture the part.  

The degree that a sketch is complete depends on its  intended use. Obviously, a sketch used only to represent  an object pictorially need not be dimensioned. If a part is  to be manufactured from the sketch, it should show all the  necessary construction details.  

# Care of Drafting Instruments  

Good drawing instruments are expensive precision tools.  Reasonable care given to them during their use and storage  can prolong their service life.  

T-squares, triangles, and scales should not be used or placed  where their surfaces or edges may be damaged. Use a drawing  board only for its intended purpose and not in a manner that  can mar the working surface.  

Compasses, dividers, and pens provide better results with  less annoyance, if they are correctly shaped and sharpened  and are not damaged by careless handling. Store drawing  instruments in a place where they are not likely to be damaged  by contact with other tools or equipment. Protect compass and  divider points by inserting them into a piece of soft rubber or  similar material. Never store ink pens without first cleaning  and drying them thoroughly.

# Graphs & Charts  

Graphs and charts are frequently used to convey information  graphically or information given certain conditions. They  often utilize values shown on the “x” and “y” axes that can  be projected up and across to arrive at a specific result. Also,  when data is entered into a computer database, software  programs can create a variety of different bar graphs, pie  charts, and so forth, to graphically represent that data.  

# Reading & Interpreting Graphs & Charts  

When interpreting information shown on graphs and charts,  it is extremely important that all the notes and legend  information be carefully understood to eliminate any  misinterpretation of the information presented.  

# Nomograms  

A nomogram is a graph that usually consists of three  sets of data. Knowledge of any two sets of data enables  the interpreter to obtain the value for the third unknown  corresponding value. One type of nomogram consists of three  parallel scales graduated for different variables, so that when  a straight edge connects any two values, the third can be read  directly. Other types may use values on the “x” and “y” axes  of a graph with the third corresponding value determined by  the intersection of the “x” and “y” values with one of a series  of curved lines.  Figure 4-32  is an example of a nomogram  that shows the relationship between aviation fuels, specific  weight, and temperature.  

# Microfilm & Microfiche  

The practice of recording drawings, parts catalogs, and  maintenance and overhaul manuals on microfilms was  utilized extensively in the past. Microfilm is available as  regular   $16\:\mathrm{mm}$   or   $35~\mathrm{mm}$   film. Since  $35~\mathrm{mm}$   film is larger,  it provides a better reproduction of drawings. Microfiche is  a card with pages laid out in a grid format. Microfilm and  microfiche require use of special devices for both reading  and printing the information.  

Most modern aircraft manufacturers have replaced microfilm  and microfiche with digital storage methods utilizing CDs,  DVDs, and other data storage devices. A great deal of service  and repair information for older aircraft has been transferred  to digital storage devices. However, there may still be a need  to access information using the old methods. A well-equipped  shop should have available, both the old microfilm and  microfiche equipment, as well as new computer equipment.  

# Digital Images  

Though not a drawing, a digital image created by a digital  camera can be extremely helpful to aviation maintenance  technicians in evaluating and sharing information concerning  the airworthiness or other information about aircraft. Digital  images can be rapidly transmitted over the World Wide Web  as attachments to e-mail messages. Images of structural  fatigue cracks, failed parts, or other flaws, as well as desired  design and paint schemes, are just a few examples of the types  of digital images that might be shared by any number of users  over the Internet.  Figure 4-33  is a digital image of damage  to a composite structure taken with a simple digital camera.

To provide information about the extent of the damage, a  measurement scale, or other object, such as a coin, can be  placed near the area of concern before the picture is taken.  Also, within the text of the e-mail, the technician should  state the exact location of the damage, referenced to fuselage  station, wing station, and so forth.

# Chapter 5 Physics for Aviation  

Physical science, which is most often called physics, is a very  interesting and exciting topic. For an individual who likes  technical things and is a hands-on type of person, physics  is an invaluable tool. Physics allows us to explain how  engines work, both piston and gas turbine; how airplanes  and helicopters fly; and countless other things related to the  field of aviation and aerospace. In addition to allowing us to  explain the operation of the things around us, it also allows  us to quantify them. For example, through the use of physics  we can explain what the concept of thrust means for a jet  engine, and then follow it up by mathematically calculating  the pounds of thrust being created.  

Physics is the term applied to an area of knowledge regarding  the basic and fundamental nature of matter and energy. It does  not attempt to determine why matter and energy behave as  they do in their relation to physical phenomena, but rather  how they behave. The people who maintain and repair aircraft  should have knowledge of basic physics, which is sometimes  called the science of matter and energy.  

# Matter  

Matter is the foundation, or the building blocks, for any  discussion of physics. According to the dictionary, matter is  what all things are made of; whatever occupies space, has  mass, and is perceptible to the senses in some way. According  to the Law of Conservation, matter cannot be created or  destroyed, although it is possible to change its physical state.  When liquid gasoline vaporizes and mixes with air, and then  burns, it might seem that this piece of matter has disappeared  and no longer exists. Although it no longer exists in the state  of liquid gasoline, the matter still exists in the form of the  gases given off by the burning fuel.  

# Characteristics of Matter  Mass & Weight  

Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object. In  other words, how many molecules are in the object, how  many atoms are in the object, or to be more specific, how  many protons, neutrons, and electrons are in the object. The  mass of an object does not change regardless of where you  take it in the universe, or with a change of state. The only  way to change the mass of an object is to add or take away  atoms. Mathematically, mass can be stated as follows:  

Mass  $=$   Weight  $\div$   Acceleration due to gravity  

The acceleration due to gravity here on earth is 32.2 feet  per second per second   $(32.2~\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s})$  ). An object weighing 32.2  pounds (lb) here on earth is said to have a mass of 1 slug.  A slug is a quantity of mass that will accelerate at a rate of  1 ft.  $/\mathrm{s}^{2}$   when a force of 1 pound is applied. In other words,  under standard atmospheric condition, which is that gravity is  equal to  $32.2\,\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s},$  , a mass of one slug would be equal to 32.2 lb.  

Weight is a measure of the pull from gravity acting on the  mass of an object. The more mass an object has, the more it  will weigh under the earth’s force of gravity. The only way for  an object to be weightless is for gravity to go away, because  it is not possible for the mass of an object to disappear. When  we view astronauts on the space shuttle, it appears that they  are weightless. Even though the shuttle is far from the surface  of the earth, the force of gravity has not completely gone  away, and the astronauts are not weightless. The astronauts  and the space shuttle are actually in a state of free fall, so  relative to the shuttle the astronauts appear to be weightless.  Mathematically, weight can be stated as follows:  

$$
{\mathrm{Weibt}}={\mathrm{Mass}}\times{\mathrm{GIV}}
$$  

# Attraction  

Attraction is mutual force acting between particles of matter,  which tends to draw them together. Sir Isaac Newton called  this the “Law of Universal Gravitation.” Newton showed  how each particle of matter attracts every other particle,  how people are bound to the earth, and how the planets are  attracted in the solar system.  

# Porosity  

Porosity means having pores or spaces where smaller  particles may fit when a mixture takes place. This is  sometimes referred to as granular—consisting or appearing  to consist of small grains or granules.  

# Impenetrability  

Impenetrability means that no two objects can occupy the  same place at the same time. Thus, two portions of matter  cannot at the same time occupy the same space.  

The density of a substance is its weight per unit volume.  The unit volume selected for use in the English system of  measurement is 1 cubic foot   $(\mathrm{ft}^{3})$  . In the metric system, it  is 1 cubic centimeter  $(\mathrm{cm}^{3})$  . Therefore, density is expressed  in pounds per cubic foot (lb⁄ft 3 ) or in grams per cubic  centimeter   $\mathsf{\Gamma}(\mathsf{g}\mathsf{c m}^{3})$  .  

To find the density of a substance, its weight and volume must  be known. Its weight is then divided by its volume to find  the weight per unit volume. For example, the liquid which  fills a certain container weighs 1,497.6 lb. The container  is 4 ft long, 3 ft wide and 2 ft deep. Its volume is   $24~\mathrm{ft}^{3}$  (4 ft.  $\times\,3$   ft.  $\times\,2$   ft.). If  $24\,\mathrm{ft}^{3}$   of liquid weighs 1,497.6 lb, then   $1~\mathrm{ft}^{3}$   weighs   $1{,}497.6\div24$  , or   $62.4\,\mathrm{lb}$  . Therefore, the density  of the liquid is  $62.4\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{ft}^{3}$  . This is the density of water at  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Centigrade) and is usually used as the standard for comparing  densities of other substances. In the metric system, the density  of water is  $1\;\mathsf{g}\mathsf{e}\mathsf{m}^{3}$  . The standard temperature of  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   is used  when measuring the density of liquids and solids. Changes  in temperature will not change the weight of a substance,  but will change the volume of the substance by expansion or  contraction, thus changing its weight per unit volume.  

The procedure for finding density applies to all substances;  however, it is necessary to consider the pressure when finding  the density of gases. Pressure is more critical when measuring  the density of gases than it is for other substances. The  density of a gas increases in direct proportion to the pressure  exerted on it. Standard conditions for the measurement of  the densities of gases have been established at   $0~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  temperature and a pressure of  $76\,\mathrm{cm}$   of mercury   $(\mathrm{Hg})$  , which  is the average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level. Density  is computed based on these conditions for all gases.  

# Specific Gravity  

It is often necessary to compare the density of one substance  with another substance. For this purpose, a standard is  needed. Water is the standard that physicists have chosen to  use when comparing the densities of all liquids and solids.  For gases, air is most commonly used, but hydrogen is also  sometimes used as a standard for gases. In physics, the word  “specific” implies a ratio. Thus, specific gravity is calculated  by comparing the weight of a definite volume of the given  substance with the weight of an equal volume of water. The  terms “specific weight” or “specific density” are sometimes  used to express this ratio.  

The following formulas are used to find the specific gravity  of liquids and solids.  

Weight of the substance Specific Gravity  $=$     Weight of an equal volume of water  

The same formulas are used to find the density of gases by  substituting air or hydrogen for water.  

Specific gravity is not expressed in units, but as pure numbers.  For example, if a certain hydraulic fluid has a specific gravity  of 0.8, 1 ft 3  of the liquid weighs 0.8 times as much as 1 ft 3 of water: 62.4 times 0.8, or 49.92 lb.  

Specific gravity and density are independent of the size of  the sample under consideration and depend only upon the  substance of which it is made. See  Figure 5-1  for typical  values of specific gravity for various substances.  

A device called a hydrometer is used for measuring specific  gravity of liquids. This device consists of a tubular glass float  contained in a larger glass tube.  [Figure 5-2]  The larger glass  tube provides the container for the liquid. A rubber suction  bulb draws the liquid up into the container. There must be  enough liquid raising the float to prevent it from touching the  bottom. The float is weighted and has a vertically graduated  scale. To determine specific gravity, the scale is read at the  surface of the liquid in which the float is immersed. An  indication of 1000 is read when the float is immersed in pure  water. When immersed in a liquid of greater density, the float  rises, indicating a greater specific gravity. For liquids of lesser  density, the float sinks, indicating a lower specific gravity.  

An example of the use of the hydrometer is to determine  the specific gravity of the electrolyte (battery liquid) in an  aircraft battery. When a battery is discharged, the calibrated  float immersed in the electrolyte will indicate approximately  1150. The indication of a charged battery is between 1275  and 1310. The values 1150, 1275, and 1310 represent 1.150, 

 1.275, and 1.310. The electrolyte in a discharged battery is 

 1.15 times denser than water, and in a charged battery 1.275  to 1.31 times denser than water.  

# Energy  

Energy is typically defined as something that gives us the  capacity to perform work. As individuals, saying that we  feel full of energy is an indicator that we can perform a lot  of work. Energy can be classified as one of two types: either  as potential energy or kinetic energy.  

# Potential Energy  

Potential energy is defined as being energy at rest, or energy  that is stored. Potential energy may be classified into three  groups: (1) energy due to position, (2) energy due to distortion  of an elastic body, and (3) energy which produces work  through chemical action. Examples of the first group are  water in an elevated reservoir or an airplane raised off the  ground with jacks; a stretched bungee cord on a Piper Tri- Pacer or compressed spring are examples of the second group;  and energy in aviation gasoline, food, or storage batteries are  examples of the third group.  

To calculate the potential energy of an object due to its  position, as in height, the following formula is used:  

#  ${\mathrm{potential~Energy}}={\mathrm{Weibant}}\times{\mathrm{Hei}}$  

A calculation based on this formula will produce an answer  that has units of foot-pounds (ft-lb) or inch-pounds (in-lb),  which are the same units that apply to work. Work, which  is covered later in this chapter, is described as a force being  applied over a measured distance, with the force being pounds  and the distance being feet or inches. Potential energy and  work have a lot in common.  

Example: A Boeing 747 weighing 450,000 pounds needs to  be raised 4 feet in the air so maintenance can be done on the  landing gear. How much potential energy does the airplane  possess because of this raised position?  

Potential Energy  $=$  Weight  $\times$   Height	  $\mathrm{PE}=450{,}000\;\mathrm{lb}\times4$   ft	  $\mathrm{PE}=1{,}800{,}000\ \mathrm{t}$  ft-lb  

As previously mentioned, aviation gasoline possesses  potential energy because of its chemical nature. Gasoline  has the potential to release heat energy, based on its British  thermal unit (BTU) content. One pound of aviation gas  contains 18,900 BTU of heat energy, and each BTU is  capable of 778 ft-lb of work. So, when we multiply 778 by  18,900, we find that one pound of aviation gas is capable of  14,704,200 ft-lb of work. Imagine the potential energy in the  completely serviced fuel tanks of an airplane.  

# Kinetic Energy  

Kinetic energy is defined as being energy that is in motion.  An airplane rolling down the runway or a rotating flywheel  on an engine are both examples of kinetic energy. Kinetic  energy has the same units as potential energy, namely foot- pounds or inch-pounds. To calculate the kinetic energy for  something in motion, the following formula is used:  

$$
\mathrm{Kinetic~Energy}=\mathrm{}{}^{1}\!/\!2\mathrm{\;Mass}\times\mathrm{Velovity}^{2}
$$  

To use the formula, we will show the mass as weight divided  by gravity and the velocity of the object will be in feet per  second. This is necessary to end up with units in foot-pounds.  

![Figure 5-1.   Specific gravity of various substances. ](images/d966b76812818472b3fa4e9d20e91d6e19c8befb4db08300d454ba0c464fc511.jpg)

Figure 5-2.   Hydrometer for checking battery specific gravity.  

Example: An Airbus A380 weighing 600,000 lb is moving  down the runway on its takeoff roll with a velocity of 200 fps.  How many foot-pounds of kinetic energy does the airplane  possess?  [Figure 5-3]  

Kinetic Energy  $=\%$   Mass  $\times$   Velocity 2 Kinetic Energy	=   $=1/2\times600,\!000\div32.2\times200^{2}$   $\mathrm{KE}=372{,}670{,}000\;\mathrm{ft{-}l b}$  

In the metric system, the force is identified in newtons (N)  and the distance in meters, with the resultant units being  joules. One pound of force is equal to  $4.448\,\mathrm{N}$   and one meter  is equal to 3.28 feet. One joule is equal to 0.74 ft-lb.  

Example: How much work is accomplished by jacking a  150,000-lb Airbus A-320 airplane a vertical height of 4 ft?  [Figure 5-4]  

# Force, Work, Power, & Torque  

# Force  

Before the concept of work, power, or torque can be discussed,  we need to understand what force means. According to the  dictionary, force is the intensity of an impetus, or the intensity  of an input. For example, if we apply a force to an object, the  tendency will be for the object to move. Another way to look  at it is that for work, power, or torque to exist, there must be  a force that initiates the process.  

The unit for force in the English system of measurement  is pounds, and in the metric system it is newtons. One  pound of force is equal to 4.448 newtons. When we  calculate the thrust of a turbine engine, we use the formula  “Force  $\mathbf{\Delta}\,=\mathbf{Mas}\mathbf{\Omega}\times\mathbf{A}$  cceleration,” and the thrust of the engine is  expressed in pounds. The GE90-115 turbofan engine (power  plant for the Boeing 777-300), for example, has 115,000  pounds of thrust.  

# Work  

The study of machines, both simple and complex, can be  seen as a study of the energy of mechanical work. This is  true because all machines transfer input energy, or the work  done on the machine, to output energy, or the work done by  the machine.  

Work, in the mechanical sense of the term, is done when a  resistance is overcome by force acting through a measurable  distance. Two factors are involved: (1) force and (2) movement  through a distance. As an example, suppose a small aircraft  is stuck in the snow. Two men push against it for a period of  time, but the aircraft does not move. According to the technical  definition, no work had been done when the men were pushing  against the aircraft. By definition, work is accomplished only  when an object is displaced some distance against a resistive  force. To calculate work, the following formula is used:  

$$
\mathrm{Work=Force\left(F\right)\times d i s t a n c e\left(d\right)}
$$  

In the English system, the force will be identified in pounds  and the distance either in feet or inches, so the units will be  foot-pounds or inch-pounds. Notice these are the same units  that were used for potential and kinetic energy.  

Example: How much work is accomplished when a tow  tractor is hooked up to a tow bar and a Boeing 737-800  airplane weighing 130,000 lb is pushed 80 ft. into the hangar?  The force on the tow bar is 5,000 lb.  

In this last example, notice the force does not equal the weight  of the airplane. This is because the airplane is being moved  horizontally and not lifted vertically. In almost all cases, it  takes less work to move something horizontally than it does  to lift it vertically. Most people can push their car a short  distance if it runs out of gas, but they cannot get under their  car and lift it off the ground.  

# Friction & Work  

In calculating work done, the actual resistance overcome is  measured. This is not necessarily the weight of the object  being moved.  [Figure 5-5]  A 900-lb load is being pulled a  distance of 200 ft. This does not mean that the work done  (force  $\times$   distance) is 180,000 ft-lb   $900~\mathtt{l b}\times200$   ft). This is  

![](images/d6e418dac748971693d59802b8e309c8ae90a9da091eea304a3ce88609614a13.jpg)  
Figure 5-3.   Kinetic energy (Airbus A380 taking off).  

because the person pulling the load is not working against the  total weight of the load, but rather against the rolling friction  of the cart, which may be no more than 90 lb.  

Friction is an important aspect of work. Without friction,  it would be impossible to walk. One would have to shove  oneself from place to place, and would have to bump against  some obstacle to stop at a destination. Yet friction is a liability  as well as an asset, and requires consideration when dealing  with any moving mechanism.  

In experiments relating to friction, measurement of the  applied forces reveals that there are three kinds of friction.  One force is required to start a body moving, while another  is required to keep the body moving at constant speed. Also,  after a body is in motion, a definitely larger force is required  to keep it sliding than to keep it rolling.  

Thus, the three kinds of friction may be classified as:  (1) starting or static friction, (2) sliding friction, and (3)  rolling friction.  

# Static Friction  

When an attempt is made to slide a heavy object along a  surface, the object must first be broken loose or started. Once  in motion, it slides more easily. The “breaking loose” force  is, of course, proportional to the weight of the body. The  force necessary to start the body moving slowly is designated  “F,” and “F'” is the normal force pressing the body against  the surface which is usually its weight. Since the nature of  the surfaces rubbing against each other is important, they  must be considered. The nature of the surfaces is indicated  by the coefficient of starting friction which is designated by  the letter  ${}^{\bullet}\mathbf{k}$  .” This coefficient can be established for various  materials and is often published in tabular form. Thus, when  the load (weight of the object) is known, starting friction can  be calculated by using the following formula:  

$$
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{k}\mathrm{F^{\prime}}
$$  

For example, if the coefficient of sliding friction of a  smooth iron block on a smooth, horizontal surface is 0.3,  the force required to start a 10 lb block would be 3 lb; a  40-lb block,   $12\,1{\mathfrak{b}}$  .  

Starting friction for objects equipped with wheels and roller  bearings is much smaller than that for sliding objects. For  example, a locomotive would have difficulty getting a long  train of cars in motion all at one time. Therefore, the couples  between the cars are purposely made to have a few inches of  play. When starting the train, the engineer backs the engine  until all the cars are pushed together. Then, with a quick  start forward the first car is set in motion. This technique is  

![](images/8c55948c7ddef27df2a76d4856f4aaf83e458c887f7a62ba6b38c378a0765932.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.   Airplane on jacks.  

employed to overcome the static friction of each wheel as  well as the inertia of each car. It would be impossible for the  engine to start all of the cars at the same instant, for static  friction, which is the resistance of being set in motion, would  be greater than the force exerted by the engine. However, once  the cars are in motion, the static friction is greatly reduced  and a smaller force is required to keep the train in motion  than was required to start it.  

# Sliding Friction  

Sliding friction is the resistance to motion offered by an object  sliding over a surface. It pertains to friction produced after the  object has been set in motion, and is always less than starting  friction. The amount of sliding resistance is dependent on the  nature of the surface of the object, the surface over which  it slides, and the normal force between the object and the  surface. This resistive force may be computed by using the  following formula:  

$$
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{mN}
$$  

In the formula above, “F” is the resistive force due to friction  expressed in pounds; “N” is the force exerted on or by the  object perpendicular (normal) to the surface over which it  slides; and “m” (mu) is the coefficient of sliding friction. On  a horizontal surface,  $_\mathrm{N}$   is equal to the weight of the object in  pounds. The area of the sliding object exposed to the sliding  surface has no effect on the results. A block of wood, for  

![](images/db62fd3b029825c7df9ffb8c7468a54b26ba01895295eb27227d234f30f45160.jpg)  
Figure 5-5.   The effect of friction on work.  

example, will not slide any easier on one of the broad sides  than it will on a narrow side, assuming all sides have the  same smoothness. Therefore, area does not enter into the  equation above.  

# Rolling Friction  

Resistance to motion is greatly reduced if an object is  mounted on wheels or rollers. The force of friction for  objects mounted on wheels or rollers is called rolling friction.  This force may be computed by the same equation used in  computing sliding friction, but the values of   $\mathrm{"m"}$   will be  much smaller. For example, the value of “m” for rubber tires  on concrete or macadam is about 0.02. The value of “m” for  roller bearings is very small, usually ranging from 0.001 to  0.003 and is often disregarded.  

Example: An aircraft with a gross weight of 79,600 lb is  towed over a concrete ramp. What force must be exerted  by the towing vehicle to keep the airplane rolling after once  set in motion?  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{F=mN}}\\ {\mathrm{\Gamma=0.02\mu\times79{,}600\,l b}}\\ {\mathrm{\Gamma=1{,}592\,l b}}\end{array}
$$  

# Power  

The concept of power involves the previously discussed  topic of work, which was a force being applied over a  measured distance, but adds one more consideration—time.  In other words, how long it takes to accomplish the work.  If someone asked the average person if they could lift one  million pounds 5 feet off the ground, the answer most  assuredly would be no. This person would probably assume  that they are to lift it all at once. What if they are given 365  days to lift it, and could lift small amounts of weight at a  time? The work involved would be the same, regardless of  how long it took to lift the weight, but the power required  is different.  If the weight is to be lifted in a shorter period  of time, it will take more power. The formula for power is  as follows:  

#  $\mathrm{Power}=\mathrm{Force}\times\mathrm{distance}\div\mathrm{time}$  

The units for power will be foot-pounds per minute, foot- pounds per second, inch-pounds per minute or second, and  possibly mile-pounds per hour. The units depend on how  distance and time are measured.  

Many years ago, there was a desire to compare the power  of the newly evolving steam engine to that of horses.  People wanted to know how many horses the steam engine  was equivalent to. The value we know currently as one  horsepower (hp) was developed, and it is equal to 550 foot- pounds per second (ft-lb/s) because of this. It was found that  the average horse could lift a weight of  $550\,1\mathbf{b}$  , one foot off  the ground, in one second. The values we use today, in order  to convert power to horsepower, are as follows:  

$1\;\mathrm{hp}=550$   ft-lb/s  $1\;\mathrm{h}\mathfrak{p}=33{,}000$   ft-lb/min.  $1\;\mathrm{h}\mathfrak{p}=375$   mile pounds per hour (mi-lb/hr.)  $1{\mathrm{~hpm}}=746$   watts (electricity conversion)  

To convert power to horsepower, divide the power by the  appropriate conversion based on the units being used.  

Example: What power would be needed, and also horsepower,  to raise the GE-90 turbofan engine into position to install  it on a Boeing 777-300 airplane? The engine weighs  19,000 lb, and it must be lifted 4 ft in 2 minutes.  

Power  $=$  Force  $\times$   distance  $\div$   time  $\begin{array}{r}{=19{,}000\;1\mathrm{b}\times4\;\mathrm{ft}\div2\;\mathrm{min}.}\end{array}$  	= 38,000 ft-lb/min.  $\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{H\mathbf{p}=38,\!000\ f t\!-\!\!1b/\!min.:-33,\!000\ f t\!-\!\!1b/\!\operatorname*{min}.}}\\ {\mathrm{H\mathbf{p}=1.15}}\end{array}$  

The hoist that will be used to raise this engine into position  will need to be powered by an electric motor because the  average person will not be able to generate   $1.15\;\mathrm{hr}$   in their  arms for the necessary 2 minutes.  

# Torque  

Torque is a very interesting concept and occurrence, and it is  definitely something that needs to be discussed in conjunction  with work and power. Whereas work is described as force  acting through a distance, torque is described as force acting  along a distance. Torque is something that creates twisting  If we push on an object with a force of   $10\;1{\mathfrak{b}}$   and it moves  10 inches in a straight line, we have done 100 in-lb of  work. By comparison, if we have a wrench 10 inches long  that is on a bolt, and we push down on it with a force of 10  lb, a torque of 100 lb-in is applied to the bolt. If the bolt  was already tight and did not move as we pushed down on  the wrench, the torque of 100 lb-in would still exist. The  formula for torque is:  

$$
{\mathrm{Torque}}={\mathrm{Force}}\times{\mathrm{distance}}
$$  

Even though this formula looks the same as the other formula  for calculating work, recognize that the distance value in this  formula is not the linear distance an object moves, but rather  the distance along which the force is applied.  

Notice that with torque nothing had to move, because the  force is being applied along a distance and not through a  distance. Notice also that although the units of work and  torque appear to be the same, they are not. The units of work  were inch-pounds and the units of torque were pound-inches,  and that is what differentiates the two.  

Torque is very important when thinking about how engines  work, both piston engines and gas turbine engines. Both  types of engines create torque in advance of being able  to create work or power. With a piston engine, a force in  pounds pushes down on the top of the piston and tries to  make it move. The piston is attached to the connecting rod,  which is attached to the crankshaft at an offset. That offset  would be like the length of the wrench discussed earlier,  and the force acting along that length is what creates torque.  [Figure 5-6]  

For the cylinder in  Figure 5-6 , there is a force of   $500~1\textb$    pushing down on the top of the piston. The connecting rod  attaches to the crankshaft at an offset distance of 4 in. The  product of the force and the offset distance is the torque, in  this case 2,000 lb-in.  

In a turbine engine, the turbine blades at the back of the engine  extract energy from the high velocity exhaust gases. The energy  extracted becomes a force in pounds pushing on the turbine  blades, which happen to be a certain number of inches from  the center of the shaft they are trying to make rotate. The  number of inches from the turbine blades to the center of the  shaft would be like the length of the wrench discussed earlier.  

Mathematically, there is a relationship between the  horsepower of an engine and the torque of an engine. The  formula that shows this relationship is as follows:  

Example: A Cessna 172R has a Lycoming IO-360 engine that  creates 180 horsepower at  $2{,}700\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . How many pound-feet  of torque is the engine producing?  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{Torque}=180\times5{,}252\div2{,}700}\\ {=350\;\mathrm{lb}{\cdot}\mathrm{ft}.}\end{array}
$$  

# Simple Machines  

A machine is any device with which work may be  accomplished. For example, machines can be used for any of  the following purposes, or combinations of these 5 purposes:  

1.	 Machines are used to transform energy, as in the case  of a generator transforming mechanical energy into  electrical energy.  2.	 Machines are used to transfer energy from one place  to another, as in the examples of the connecting rods,  crankshaft, and reduction gears transferring energy  from an aircraft’s engine to its propeller. 3.	 Machines are used to multiply force; for example, a  system of pulleys may be used to lift a heavy load. The  pulley system enables the load to be raised by exerting  a force that is smaller than the weight of the load. 4.	 Machines can be used to multiply speed. A good  example is the bicycle, by which speed can be gained  by exerting a greater force. 5.	 Machines can be used to change the direction of  a force. An example of this use is the flag hoist. A  downward force on one side of the rope exerts an  upward force on the other side, raising the flag toward  the top of the pole.  

There are only six simple machines. They are the lever, the  pulley, the wheel and axle, the inclined plane, the screw,  and the gear. Physicists, however, recognize only two basic  principles in machines: the lever and the inclined plane.  The pulley (block and tackle), the wheel and axle, and gears  operate on the machine principle of the lever. The wedge and  the screw use the principle of the inclined plane.  

An understanding of the principles of simple machines provides  a necessary foundation for the study of compound machines,  which are combinations of two or more simple machines.  

# Mechanical Advantage of Machines  

As identified in statements 3 and 4 under simple machines, a  machine can be used to multiply force or to multiply speed. It  cannot, however, multiply force and speed at the same time.  In order to gain one force, it must lose the other force. To do  otherwise would mean the machine has more power going  

![](images/2919f674f375535c8275ab0b48330561b393cdb788bf2a4c3f67dc248e4bdd80.jpg)

out than coming in, and that is not possible.  

In reference to machines, mechanical advantage is a  comparison of the output force to the input force, or the  output distance to the input distance. If there is a mechanical  advantage in terms of force, there will be a fractional  disadvantage in terms of distance.  The following formulas  can be used to calculate mechanical advantage.  

Mechanical Advantage  $=$   Force Out  $\div$   Force In Mechanical Advantage  $=$   Distance Out  $\div$   Distance In  

# The Lever  

The simplest machine, and perhaps the most familiar one, is  the lever. A seesaw is a familiar example of a lever, with two  people sitting on either end of a board and a pivoting point  in the middle. There are three basic parts in all levers. They  are the fulcrum “F,” a force or effort “E,” and a resistance  “R.” Shown in  Figure 5-7  are the pivot point “F” (fulcrum),  the effort “E” which is applied at a distance “L” from the  fulcrum, and a resistance “R” which acts at a distance “l”  from the fulcrum. Distances “L” and “l” are the lever arms.  

The concept of torque was discussed earlier in this chapter,  and torque is very much involved in the operation of a lever.  When a person sits on one end of a seesaw, that person applies  a downward force in pounds which acts along the distance  to the center of the seesaw. This combination of force and  distance creates torque, which tries to cause rotation.  

# First Class Lever  

In the first class lever, the fulcrum is located between the  effort and the resistance. As mentioned earlier, the seesaw  is a good example of a lever, and it happens to be a first  class lever. The amount of weight and the distance from  the fulcrum can be varied to suit the need. Increasing the  distance from the applied effort to the fulcrum, compared to  the distance from the fulcrum to the weight being moved,  increases the advantage provided by the lever. Crowbars,  shears, and pliers are common examples of this class of lever.  The proper balance of an airplane is also a good example,  with the center of lift on the wing being the pivot point, or  fulcrum, and the weight fore and aft of this point being the  effort and the resistance.  

When calculating how much effort is required to lift a specific  weight, or how much weight can be lifted by a specific effort,  the following formula can be used.  

Effort  $(\mathrm{E})\times$   Effort Arm (L)  $=$   Resistance  $(\mathrm{R})\,\times$   Resistance Arm (l) What this formula really shows is the input torque (effort  $\times$  effort arm) equals the output torque (resistance  $\times$   resistance  arm). This formula and concept apply to all three classes of  levers and to all simple machines in general.  

Example: A first class lever is to be used to lift a 500-lb  weight. The distance from the weight to the fulcrum is  12 inches and from the fulcrum to the applied effort is 60  inches. How much force is required to lift the weight?  

Effort  $(\mathrm{E})\times$   Effort Arm  $\mathrm{(L)}=$   Resistance  $(\mathrm{R})\,\times$   Resistance Arm (l)  

$\mathrm{E}\times60\;\mathrm{in}=500\,\mathrm{lb}\times12$  

$\mathrm{E}=500\,1\mathrm{b}\times12\,\mathrm{in}\div60$  

The mechanical advantage of the lever in this example  would be:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{Mechanical~Advantage}=\mathrm{Force~Out}\div\mathrm{Force}\;\mathrm{In}}\\ {=500\;\mathrm{lb}\div100\;\mathrm{lb}}\\ {=5,\mathrm{or}\;5\;\mathrm{to}\;1}\end{array}
$$  

An interesting thing to note with this example lever is if the  applied effort moved down 10 inches, the weight on the other  end would only move up 2 inches. The weight being lifted  would only move one-fifth as far. The reason for this is the  concept of work. If it allows you to lift 5 times more weight,  you will only move it  $\%$   as far as you move the effort, because  a lever cannot have more work output than input.  

# Second Class Lever  

The second class lever has the fulcrum at one end and the  effort is applied at the other end. The resistance is somewhere  between these points. A wheelbarrow is a good example of  a second class lever, with the wheel at one end being the  fulcrum, the handles at the opposite end being the applied  effort, and the bucket in the middle being where the weight  or resistance is placed.  [Figure 5-8]  

Both first and second class levers are commonly used to help  in overcoming big resistances with a relatively small effort.  The first class lever, however, is more versatile. Depending  on how close or how far away the weight is placed from the  fulcrum, the first class lever can be made to gain force or  gain distance, but not both at the same time. The second class  lever can only be made to gain force.  

Example: The distance from the center of the wheel to the  handles on a wheelbarrow is 60 inches. The weight in the  bucket is 18 inches from the center of the wheel. If 300 lb is  placed in the bucket, how much force must be applied at the  handles to lift the wheelbarrow?  

Effort  $(\mathrm{E})\times$   Effort  $\mathrm{Arm(L)}=$  Resistance  $(\mathrm{R})\,\times$   Resistance Arm (l)

 	  $\mathrm{E}\times60$   inches  $=300\;\mathsf{l b}\times18$   in

 	  $\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{E}=300\;\mathrm{l}\flat\times18\;\mathrm{in}\div60\;\mathrm{in}}\\ {\mathrm{E}=90\;\mathrm{l}\flat}\end{array}$  E	 = 300 lb × 18 in ÷ 60 in  

The mechanical advantage of the lever in this example  would be:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Mechanical~Advantage=Fore~Out\divForce~In}}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad=300\;\mathrm{lb\div~90~lb}}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad=3.33,\mathrm{or}\;3.33\;\mathrm{to}\;1}\end{array}}\end{array}
$$  

# Third Class Lever  

There are occasions when it is desirable to speed up the  movement of the resistance even though a large amount of  effort must be used. Levers that help accomplish this are third  

![](images/ea871a844bed719d84f951812e9d1c63252506f5ed3de906b6d1b8e1d97014ff.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.   First class lever.  

class levers. As shown in  Figure 5-9 , the fulcrum is at one end  of the lever and the weight or resistance to be overcome is at  the other end, with the effort applied at some point between.  Third class levers are easily recognized because the effort is  applied between the fulcrum and the resistance. The retractable  main landing gear on an airplane is a good example of a third  class lever. The top of the landing gear, where it attaches to the  airplane, is the pivot point. The wheel and brake assembly at  the bottom of the landing gear is the resistance. The hydraulic  actuator that makes the gear retract is attached somewhere in  the middle, and that is the applied effort.  

# The Pulley  

Pulleys are simple machines in the form of a wheel mounted  on a fixed axis and supported by a frame. The wheel, or disk,  is normally grooved to accommodate a rope. The wheel is  sometimes referred to as a “sheave,” or sometimes “sheaf.”  The frame that supports the wheel is called a block. A block and  tackle consists of a pair of blocks. Each block contains one or  more pulleys and a rope connecting the pulley(s) of each block.  

# Single Fixed Pulley  

A single fixed pulley is really a first class lever with equal arms.  In  Figure 5-10 , the arm from point “R” to point “F” is equal to  the arm from point “F” to point “E,” with both distances being  equal to the radius of the pulley. When a first class lever has  equal arms, the mechanical advantage is 1. Thus, the force of  the pull on the rope must be equal to the weight of the object  being lifted. The only advantage of a single fixed pulley is to  change the direction of the force, or pull on the rope.  

# Single Movable Pulley  

A single pulley can be used to magnify the force exerted. In  Figure 5-11 , the pulley is movable, and both ropes extending  up from the pulley are sharing in the support of the weight.  This single, movable pulley will act like a second class lever.  The effort arm (EF) being the diameter of this pulley and the  resistance arm (FR) being the radius of this pulley. This type of  pulley would have a mechanical advantage of two because the  diameter of the pulley is double the radius of the pulley. In use,  if someone pulled in 4 ft of the effort rope, the weight would  only rise off the floor 2 ft. If the weight was   $100\,\mathrm{lb}$  , the effort  

![](images/53c2786ab5b636c97096bf0628978543bf9da60a96f03abd470488e50c8ac07b.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.   Second class lever.  

applied would only need to be 50 lb. With this type of pulley,  the effort will always be one-half of the weight being lifted.  

# Block and Tackle  

A block and tackle is made up of multiple pulleys, some of  them fixed and some movable. In  Figure 5-12 , the block and  tackle is made up of four pulleys, the top two being fixed and  the bottom two being movable. Viewing the figure from right  to left, notice there are four ropes supporting the weight and  a fifth rope where the effort is applied. The number of weight  supporting ropes determines the mechanical advantage of a  block and tackle, so in this case the mechanical advantage  is four. If the weight was   $200~1\textb$  , it would require a   $50~1\textb$  effort to lift it.  

# The Gear  

Two gears with teeth on their outer edges, as shown in  Figure 5-13 , act like a first class lever when one gear drives  the other. The gear with the input force is called the drive  gear, and the other is called the driven gear. The effort arm  is the diameter of the driven gear, and the resistance arm is  the diameter of the drive gear.  

Notice that the two gears turn in opposite directions: the  bottom one clockwise and the top one counterclockwise. The  gear on top is 9 inches in diameter and has 45 teeth, and the  gear on the bottom is 12 inches in diameter and has 60 teeth.  

Imagine that the blue gear is driving the yellow one, which  makes the blue the drive and the yellow the driven. The  mechanical advantage in terms of force would be the effort  arm divided by the resistance arm, or  $9\div12$  , which is 0.75.  This would actually be called a fractional disadvantage,  because there would be less force out than force in. The  mechanical advantage in terms of distance, in rpm in this  case, would be   $12\div9$  , or 1.33.  

This analysis tells us that when a large gear drives a small  one, the small one turns faster and has less available force. In  order to be a force gaining machine, the small gear needs to  turn the large one. When the terminology reduction gearbox  is used, such as a propeller reduction gearbox, it means that  there is more rpm going in than is coming out. The end result  

![](images/2e617c08568fe9dd657af6d29c3a4c9fbdc828f8731c5cb776a247bdb22e0b1b.jpg)  
Figure 5-9.   Third class lever.  

is an increase in force, and ultimately torque.  

Bevel gears are used to change the plane of rotation, so that  a shaft turning horizontally can make a vertical shaft rotate.  The size of the gears and their number of teeth determine the  mechanical advantage, and whether force is being increased  or rpm is being increased. If each gear has the same number of  teeth, there would be no change in force or rpm.  [Figure 5-14]  

The worm gear has an extremely high mechanical advantage.  The input force goes into the spiral worm gear, which drives  the spur gear. One complete revolution of the worm gear only  makes the spur gear move an amount equal to one tooth.  The mechanical advantage is equal to the number of teeth  on the spur gear, which in this case there are 25. This is a  force gaining machine, to the tune of 25 times more output  force.  [Figure 5-15]  

The planetary sun gear system is typical of what would be  found in a propeller reduction gearbox. The power output  shaft of the engine would drive the sun gear in the middle,  

![](images/2ff0998fe743f1ea43899637a9e16d2481c75603c5427138c20bd65c0ee0683f.jpg)

which rotates the planetary gears and ultimately the ring gear.  In this example, the sun gear has 28 teeth, each planet gear  has 22 teeth, and the ring gear has 82 teeth. To figure how  much gear reduction is taking place, the number of teeth on  the ring gear is divided by the number of teeth on the sun gear.  In this case, the gear reduction is 2.93, meaning the engine has  an rpm 2.93 times greater than the propeller.  [Figure 5-16]  

#  

The inclined plane is a simple machine that facilitates the  raising or lowering of heavy objects by application of a small  force over a relatively long distance. Some familiar examples  

![](images/5c2cc5daad5c417ed1a9a441a4aa23f66a5f9572bc3ce232fdc56c127d9c5b82.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.   Block and tackle.  

of the inclined plane are mountain highways and a loading  ramp on the back of a moving truck. When weighing a small  airplane, like a Cessna 172, an inclined plane, or ramp, can  be used to get the airplane on the scales by pushing it, rather  than jacking it. A ramp can be seen in  Figure 5-17 , where a  Cessna 172 right main gear is sitting on an electronic scale.  The airplane was pushed up the ramps to get it on the scales.  

With an inclined plane, the length of the incline is the effort  arm and the vertical height of the incline is the resistance  arm. If the length of the incline is five times greater than  the height, there will be a force advantage, or mechanical  advantage, of five. The Mooney M20 in  Figure 5-17  weighed  1,600 lb on the day of the weighting. The ramp it is sitting on  is 6 inches tall, which is the resistance arm, and the length of  the ramp is 24 inches, which is the effort arm. To calculate  

![](images/a311866ded7d2f3dbb8ae7a54dbbb235665ebaeb277e011f50bd2e4f2a591bf0.jpg)  
Figure 5-13.   Spur gears.  

the force needed to push the airplane up the ramps, use the  same formula introduced earlier when levers were discussed,  as follows:  

Effort  $(\mathrm{{E})\times}$   Effort  $\mathrm{Arm\left(L\right)}\mathrm{=}$  Resistance   $(\mathrm{R})\,\times$   Resistance Arm (l)

 	  $\mathrm{E}\times24\;\mathrm{in}=1,600\;\mathrm{lb}\times6$  E × 24 in	 = 1,600 lb × 6 in

 	  $\mathrm{E}=1{,}600\,\mathsf{l{-}b}\times6\,\mathrm{in}\div24\,\mathrm{in}$  E	 = 1,600 l-b × 6 in ÷ 24 in

 	  $\mathrm{E}=400$  lb  

Bolts, screws, and wedges are also examples of devices  that operate on the principle of the inclined plane. A  bolt, for example, has a spiral thread that runs around  its circumference. As the thread winds around the bolt’s  circumference, it moves a vertical distance equal to the  space between the threads. The circumference of the bolt  is the effort arm and the distance between the threads is the  resistance arm.  [Figure 5-18]  Based on this analysis, a fine  threaded bolt, which has more threads per inch, has a greater  mechanical advantage than a coarse threaded bolt.  

A chisel is a good example of a wedge. A chisel might be  8 inches long and only   $\%$   inch wide, with a sharp tip and  tapered sides. The 8-inch length is the effort arm and the  $\%\cdot$  - inch width is the resistance arm. This chisel would provide  a force advantage, or mechanical advantage, of 16.  

# Stress  

Whenever a machine is in operation, be it a simple machine  like a lever or a screw, or a more complex machine like an  aircraft piston engine or a hydraulically operated landing  gear, the parts and pieces of that machine will experience  something called stress. Whenever an external force is  applied to an object, like a weight pushing on the end of a  lever, a reaction will occur inside the object which is known  as stress. Stress is typically measured in pounds per square  foot or pounds per square inch (psi).  

External force acting on an object causes the stress to  manifest itself in one of five forms, or combination of those  five. The five forms are tension, compression, torsion,  bending, and shear.  

# Tension  

Tension is a force that tries to pull an object apart. In the  block and tackle system discussed earlier in this chapter,  the upper block that housed the two fixed pulleys was  secured to an overhead beam. The movable lower block  

![](images/1c0f9c6a3a5b8ac3cc596e3d6e7e9053412395448b0b4e5e896664f27ec0c726.jpg)

Figure 5-15.   Worm gear.  

and its two pulleys were hanging by ropes, and the weight  was hanging below the entire assembly. The weight being  lifted would cause the ropes and the blocks to be under  tension. The weight is literally trying to pull the rope apart,  and ultimately would cause the rope to break if the weight  was too great.  

# Compression  

Compression is a force that tries to crush an object. An  excellent example of compression is when a sheet metal  airplane is assembled using the fastener known as a rivet. The  rivet passes through a hole drilled in the pieces of aluminum,  and then a rivet gun on one side and a bucking bar on the  other apply a force. This applied force tries to crush the rivet  

![](images/a0ece76ac3de391f3f45eb7b0e6d86d785c91d41de17a320096ed95e43611fe8.jpg)

Figure 5-17.   Ramp in use with a Mooney M20.  

and makes it expand to fill the hole and securely hold the  aluminum pieces together.  [Figure 5-19]  

# Torsion  

Torsion is the stress an object experiences when it is  twisted, which is what happens when torque is applied to a  shaft. Torsion is made up of two other stresses: tension and  compression. When a shaft is twisted, tension is experienced  at a diagonal to the shaft and compression acts 90 degrees to  the tension.  [Figure 5-20]  

The turbine shaft on a turbofan engine, which connects to  the compressor in order to drive it, is under a torsion stress.  The turbine blades extract energy from the high velocity air  as a force in pounds. This force in pounds acts along the  length from the blades to the center of the shaft, and creates  the torque that causes rotation.  [Figure 5-21]  

# Bending  

An airplane in flight experiences a bending force on the wing  as aerodynamic lift tries to raise the wing. This force of lift  causes the skin on the top of the wing to compress and the  skin on the bottom of the wing to be under tension. When the  airplane is on the ground sitting on its landing gear, the force  of gravity tries to bend the wing downward, subjecting the  bottom of the wing to compression and the top of the wing  tension.  [Figure 5-22]  During the testing that occurs prior  to FAA certification, an airplane manufacturer intentionally  bends the wing up and down to make sure it can take the  stress without failing.  

# Shear  

When a shear stress is applied to an object, the force tries  to cut or slice through, like a knife cutting through butter.  A clevis bolt, which is often used to secure a cable to a part  of the airframe, has shear stress acting on it. As shown in  Figure 5-23 , a fork fitting is secured to the end of the cable,  

![](images/023ca6c75d1946de7cac6e35b327f7a389512ff537607157a62b9d684a65edc1.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.   A bolt and nut as an inclined plane.  

and the fork attaches to an eye on the airframe with the clevis  bolt. When the cable is put under tension, the fork tries to  slide off the eye by cutting through the clevis bolt. This bolt  would be designed to take very high shear loads.  

# Strain  

If the stress acting on an object is great enough, it can cause  the object to change its shape or to become distorted. One  characteristic of matter is that it tends to be elastic, meaning  it can be forced out of shape when a force is applied and then  return to its original shape when the force is removed. When  an object becomes distorted by an applied force, the object  is said to be strained.  

On turbine engine test cells, the thrust of the engine is  typically measured by what are called strain gages. When  the force, or thrust, of the engine is pulling out against the  strain gages, the amount of distortion is measured and then  translated into the appropriate thrust reading.  

A deflecting beam style of torque wrench uses the strain on the  drive end of the wrench and the resulting distortion of the beam  to indicate the amount of torque on a bolt or nut.  [Figure 5-24]  

# Motion  

The study of the relationship between the motion of bodies  or objects and the forces acting on them is often called the  study of “force and motion.” In a more specific sense, the  relationship between velocity, acceleration, and distance is  known as kinematics.

# Uniform Motion  

Motion may be defined as a continuing change of position  or place, or as the process in which a body undergoes  displacement. When an object is at different points in space  at different times, that object is said to be in motion, and if  the distance the object moves remains the same for a given  period of time, the motion may be described as uniform. Thus,  an object in uniform motion always has a constant speed.  

# Speed and Velocity  

In everyday conversation, speed and velocity are often used  as if they mean the same thing. In physics, they have definite  

![](images/43fd7832484edbc5d1f18c323f2666f63dd4194b728fd9589c0837667a7f4d8a.jpg)  
Figure 5-20.   Torsion on a rotating shaft, made up of tension and  compression.  

and distinct meanings. Speed refers to how fast an object is  moving, or how far the object will travel in a specific time.  The speed of an object tells nothing about the direction an  object is moving. For example, if the information is supplied  that an airplane leaves New York City and travels 8 hours at  a speed of   $150\,\mathrm{mph}$  , this information tells nothing about the  direction in which the airplane is moving. At the end of 8  hours, it might be in Kansas City, or if it traveled in a circular  route, it could be back in New York City.  

Velocity is that quantity in physics which denotes both the  speed of an object and the direction in which the object  moves. Velocity can be defined as the rate of motion in a  particular direction. Velocity is also described as being a  vector quantity, a vector being a line of specific length,  having an arrow on one end or the other. The length of the  line indicates the number value and the arrow indicates the  direction in which that number is acting.  

Two velocity vectors, such as one representing the velocity of

Figure 5-22.   Airplane on the ground, wing under tension and  compression.  

an airplane and one representing the velocity of the wind, can  be added together in what is called vector analysis.  Figure 5-25 demonstrates this, with vectors “A” and “B” representing the  velocity of the airplane and the wind, and vector “C” being the  resultant. With no wind, the speed and direction of the airplane  would be that shown by vector “A.” When accounting for the  wind direction and speed, the airplane ends up flying at the  speed and direction shown by vector “C.”  

Imagine that an airplane is flying in a circular pattern at a  constant speed. The airplane is constantly changing direction  because of the circular pattern, which means the airplane is  constantly changing velocity. The reason for this is the fact  that velocity includes direction.  

To calculate the speed of an object, the distance it travels is  divided by the elapsed time. If the distance is measured in  miles and the time in hours, the units of speed will be miles  per hour (mph). If the distance is measured in feet and the  time in seconds, the units of speed will be feet per second  (fps). To convert mph to fps, divide by 1.467. Velocity is  calculated the same way, the only difference being it must  be recalculated every time the direction changes.  

# Acceleration  

Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. If  the velocity of an object is increased from  $20\,\mathrm{mph}$   to  $30\,\mathrm{mph}$  ,  the object has been accelerated. If the increase in velocity is  10 mph in 5 seconds, the rate of change in velocity is  $10\,\mathrm{mph}$  in 5 seconds, or 2 mph per second. If this were multiplied  

![](images/d5e1e825a7619358a4cb747f7c90a74a6c8dac79b2b3b9ba806f0ed1d8dc5ebf.jpg)

Figure 5-24.   Deflecting beam torque wrench measures strain by  distortion.  

by 1.467, it could also be expressed as an acceleration of  2.93 feet per second per second (fps/s). By comparison, the  acceleration due to gravity is   $32.2~\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s}$  .  

To calculate acceleration, the following formula is used.  

Velocity Final (Vf) − Velocity Initial (Vi) Acceleration (A)  $=$  Time (t)  

Example: An Air Force F-15 fighter is cruising at  $400\,\mathrm{mph}$  The pilot advances the throttles to full afterburner and  accelerates to  $1{,}200\,\mathrm{mph}$   in 20 seconds. What is the average  acceleration in  $\mathrm{\Deltamph/s}$   and fps/s?  

$$
\mathrm{A}={\frac{\mathrm{V}\mathrm{f}-\mathrm{Vi}}{\mathrm{t}}}
$$  

$$
\mathbf{A}\,{=}\,\,\frac{1200-400}{20}
$$  

In the example just shown, the acceleration was found to be   $58.7\,\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s}$  . Since  $32.2\,\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s}$   is equal to the acceleration due  to gravity, divide the F-15’s acceleration by 32.2 to find out  how many G forces the pilot is experiencing. In this case,  it would be 1.82 Gs.  

# Newton’s Law of Motion  

When a magician snatches a tablecloth from a table and  leaves a full setting of dishes undisturbed, he is not displaying  a mystic art; he is actually demonstrating the principle of  inertia. Inertia is responsible for the discomfort felt when an  airplane is brought to a sudden halt in the parking area and  the passengers are thrown forward in their seats. Inertia is a  property of matter. This property of matter is described by  Newton’s first law of motion, which states:  

Objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion  tend to remain in motion at the same speed and in the same  direction, unless acted on by an external force.  

# Second Law  

Bodies in motion have the property called momentum. A body  that has great momentum has a strong tendency to remain  in motion and is therefore hard to stop. For example, a train  moving at even low velocity is difficult to stop because of  its large mass. Newton’s second law applies to this property.  It states:  

When a force acts upon a body, the momentum of that body  is changed. The rate of change of momentum is proportional  to the applied force. Based on Newton’s second law, the  formula for calculating thrust is derived, which states that  force equals mass times acceleration   $\mathrm{F}\,{=}\,\mathrm{MA}$  ). Earlier in this  chapter, it was determined that mass equals weight divided by  gravity, and acceleration equals velocity final minus velocity  initial divided by time. Putting all these concepts together,  the formula for thrust is:  

$$
\mathrm{Force}=\mathrm{\frac{W\left(Vf-Vi\right)}{G t}}
$$  

Example: A turbojet engine is moving   $150~1\mathrm{b}$   of air per  second through the engine. The air enters going 100 fps and  leaves going 1,200 fps. How much thrust, in pounds, is the  engine creating?  

$$
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{\frac{W\,(Vf-Vi)}{G t}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{F}=\ \frac{150\,(1200-100)}{32.2(1)}
$$

Figure 5-25.   Vector analysis for airplane velocity and wind velocity.  

# Third Law  

Newton’s third law of motion is often called the law of action  and reaction. It states that for every action there is an equal  and opposite reaction. This means that if a force is applied  to an object, the object will supply a resistive force exactly  equal to and in the opposite direction of the force applied.  It is easy to see how this might apply to objects at rest. In  application, as a man stands on the floor, the floor exerts a  force against his feet exactly equal to his weight. This law is  also applicable when a force is applied to an object in motion.  

Forces always occur in pairs. The term “acting force” means  the force one body exerts on a second body, and reacting  force means the force the second body exerts on the first.  

When an aircraft propeller pushes a stream of air backward  with a force of 500 lb, the air pushes the blades forward with  a force of 500 lb. This forward force causes the aircraft to  move forward. A turbofan engine exerts a force on the air  entering the inlet duct, causing it to accelerate out the fan  duct and the tailpipe. The air accelerating to the rear is the  action, and the force inside the engine that makes it happen  is the reaction, also called thrust.  

# Circular Motion  

Circular motion is the motion of an object along a curved  path that has a constant radius. For example, if one end of a  string is tied to an object and the other end is held in the hand,  the object can be swung in a circle. The object is constantly  deflected from a straight (linear) path by the pull exerted on  the string, as shown in  Figure 5-26 . When the weight is at  point A, due to inertia it wants to keep moving in a straight  line and end up at point B. It is forced to move in a circular  path and end up at point C because of the force being exerted  on the string.  

The string exerts a centripetal force on the object, and the  object exerts an equal but opposite force on the string,  obeying Newton’s third law of motion. The force that is equal  to centripetal force, but acting in an opposite direction, is  called centrifugal force.  

Centripetal force is always directly proportional to the mass  of the object in circular motion. Thus, if the mass of the  object in  Figure 5-26  is doubled, the pull on the string must  be doubled to keep the object in its circular path, provided  the speed of the object remains constant.  

Centripetal force is inversely proportional to the radius  of the circle in which an object travels. If the string in  Figure   $^{5.26}$   is shortened and the speed remains constant,  the pull on the string must be increased since the radius is  decreased, and the string must pull the object from its linear  path more rapidly. Using the same reasoning, the pull on the  string must be increased if the object is swung more rapidly  in its orbit. Centripetal force is thus directly proportional  to the square of the velocity of the object. The formula for  centripetal force is:  

Centripetal Force  $=$  Mass (Velocity 2 )  $\div$   Radius For the formula above, mass would typically be converted  to weight divided by gravity, velocity would be in feet per  second, and the radius would be in feet.  

Example: What would the centripetal force be if a 10-pound  weight was moving in a 3-ft radius circular path at a velocity  of 500 fps?  

Centripetal Force  $=$  Mass (Velocity 2 )  $\div$   Radius

 	 Centripetal Force  $=10\,(500^{2})\div32.2$   (3)  $=25{,}880$   lb  

In the condition identified in the example, the object acts like  it weighs 2,588 times more than it actually does. It can also  be said that the object is experiencing 2,588 Gs, or force of  gravity. The fan blades in a large turbofan engine, when the  engine is operating at maximum rpm, are experiencing many  thousands of Gs for the same reason.  

# Heat  

Heat is a form of energy. It is produced only by the conversion  of one of the other forms of energy. Heat may also be defined  as the total kinetic energy of the molecules of any substance.  

Some forms of energy which can be converted into heat  energy are as follows:  

•	 Mechanical Energy—this includes all methods of  producing increased motion of molecules such as  friction, impact of bodies, or compression of gases. •	 Electrical Energy—electrical energy is converted to  heat energy when an electric current flows through  any form of resistance such as an electric iron, electric  light, or an electric blanket. •	 Chemical Energy—most forms of chemical reaction  convert stored potential energy into heat. Some  examples are the explosive effects of gunpowder, the  burning of oil or wood, and the combining of oxygen  and grease. •	 Radiant Energy—electromagnetic waves of certain  frequencies produce heat when they are absorbed by  the bodies they strike such as x-rays, light rays, and  infrared rays. •	 Nuclear Energy—energy stored in the nucleus of  atoms is released during the process of nuclear fission  in a nuclear reactor or atomic explosion. •	 Sun—all heat energy can be directly or indirectly  traced to the nuclear reactions occurring in the sun.  

When a gas is compressed, work is done and the gas becomes  warm or hot. Conversely, when a gas under high pressure is  allowed to expand, the expanding gas becomes cool. In the  first case, work was converted into energy in the form of  heat; in the second case heat energy was expended. Since  heat is given off or absorbed, there must be a relationship  between heat energy and work. Also, when two surfaces are  rubbed together, the friction develops heat. However, work  was required to cause the heat, and by experimentation, it  has been shown that the work required and the amount of  heat produced by friction is proportional. Thus, heat can be  

![](images/c292cd16fe1a90d9365812da544a3c5f2d4c1334ba04496192a6d56fdac48e18.jpg)  
Figure 5-26.   Circular motion.  

regarded as a form of energy.  

According to this theory of heat as a form of energy, the  molecules, atoms, and electrons in all bodies are in a continual  state of motion. In a hot body, these small particles possess  relatively large amounts of kinetic energy, but in cooler  bodies they have less. Because the small particles are given  motion, and hence kinetic energy, work must be done to  slide one body over the other. Mechanical energy apparently  is transformed, and what we know as heat is really kinetic  energy of the small molecular subdivisions of matter.  

# Heat Energy Units  

Two different units are used to express quantities of heat  energy. They are the calorie and the BTU. One calorie is equal  to the amount of heat required to change the temperature of  1 gram of water 1 degree Centigrade.  

This term “calorie” (spelled with a lower case c) is 1/1,000 of  the Calorie (spelled with a capital C) used in the measurement  of the heat energy in foods. One BTU is defined as the amount  of heat required to change the temperature of 1 lb of water  1 degree Fahrenheit   $(1\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  . The calorie and the gram are  seldom used in discussing aviation maintenance. The BTU,  however, is commonly referred to in discussions of engine  thermal efficiencies and the heat content of aviation fuel.  

A device known as the calorimeter is used to measure  quantities of heat energy. In application, it may be used to  determine the quantity of heat energy available in 1 pound of  aviation gasoline. A given weight of the fuel is burned in the  calorimeter, and the heat energy is absorbed by a large quantity  of water. From the weight of the water and the increase in its  temperature, it is possible to compute the heat yield of the fuel.  A definite relationship exists between heat and mechanical  energy. This relationship has been established and verified by  many experiments which show that:  

One BTU of heat energy  $=778$   ft-lb of work  

As discussed earlier in this chapter under the topic “Potential  Energy,” one pound of aviation gasoline contains 18,900 BTU  of heat energy. Since each BTU is capable of 778 ft-lb of work,  1 lb of aviation gasoline is capable of 14,704,200 ft-lb of work.  

# Heat Energy and Thermal Efficiency  

Thermal efficiency is the relationship between the potential  for power contained in a specific heat source, and how much  usable power is created when that heat source is used. The  formula for calculating thermal efficiency is:  

Thermal Efficiency  $=$   	    Horsepower Produced  $\div$   Potential Horsepower in Fuel  

For example, consider the piston engine used in a small  general aviation airplane, which typically consumes 0.5  lb of fuel per hour for each horsepower it creates. Imagine  that the engine is creating 200 hp. If we multiply 0.5 by the  horsepower of 200, we find the engine is consuming 100 lb of  fuel per hour, or 1.67 lb per minute. Earlier in this chapter, one  horsepower was found to be 33,000 ft-lb of work per minute.  

The potential horsepower in the fuel burned for this example  engine would be:  

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{\mathrm{H\mathbf{p}=\frac{1.67\,\mathrm{lb/min}*\times18,900\,\mathrm{BTU/\mathrm{lb}\times778\,\mathrm{ft}\,\mathrm{lb/BTU}}}{33,000\,\mathrm{ft-lb/min}}}}\\ {\mathrm{H\mathbf{p}=744}}\end{array}
$$  

The example engine is burning enough fuel that it has the  potential to create 744 horsepower, but it is only creating 200.  The thermal efficiency of the engine would be:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Theoretical~Eddagger~bigcup~}=\mathrm{Tp}\;\mathrm{Production}\;\dot{\overline{{\mathbf{\tau}}}}\;\mathrm{Np}\;\mathrm{in}\;\mathrm{Fuel}}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad=200\div744}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad=.2688\;\mathrm{or}\;26.88\%}\end{array}
$$  

More than 70 percent of the energy in the fuel is not being  used to create usable horsepower. The wasted energy is in  the form of friction and heat. A tremendous amount of heat  is given up to the atmosphere and not used inside the engine  to create power.  

# Heat Transfer  

There are three methods by which heat is transferred from one  location to another or from one substance to another. These  three methods are conduction, convection, and radiation.  

# Conduction  

Heat transfer always takes place by areas of high heat energy  migrating to areas of low heat energy. Heat transfer by  conduction requires that there be physical contact between  an object that has a large amount of heat energy and one that  has a smaller amount of heat energy.  

Everyone knows from experience that the metal handle of  a heated pan can burn the hand. A plastic or wood handle,  however, remains relatively cool even though it is in direct  contact with the pan. The metal transmits the heat more  easily than the wood because it is a better conductor of heat.  Different materials conduct heat at different rates. Some  metals are much better conductors of heat than others.  Aluminum and copper are used in pots and pans because  they conduct heat very rapidly. Woods and plastics are used  for handles because they conduct heat very slowly.  

Figure 5-27  illustrates the different rates of conduction of  various metals. Of those listed, silver is the best conductor  and lead is the poorest. As mentioned previously, copper and  aluminum are used in pots and pans because they are good  conductors. It is interesting to note that silver, copper, and  aluminum are also excellent conductors of electricity.  

Liquids are poorer conductors of heat than metals. Notice  that the ice in the test tube shown in  Figure 5-28  is not  melting rapidly even though the water at the top is boiling.  The water conducts heat so poorly that not enough heat  reaches the ice to melt it.  

Gases are even poorer conductors of heat than liquids. It is  possible to stand quite close to a stove without being burned  because air is such a poor conductor. Since conduction is a  process whereby the increase in molecular energy is passed  along by actual contact, gases are poor conductors.  

At the point of application of the heat source, the molecules  become violently agitated. These molecules strike adjacent  molecules causing them to become agitated. This process  continues until the heat energy is distributed evenly  throughout the substance. The gases are much poorer  conductors of heat because molecules are farther apart in  gases than in solids.  

Materials that are poor conductors are used to prevent the  transfer of heat and are called heat insulators. A wooden  handle on a pot or a soldering iron serves as a heat insulator.  Certain materials, such as finely spun glass or asbestos,  are particularly poor heat conductors. These materials are  therefore used for many types of insulation.  

# Convection  

Convection is the process by which heat is transferred by  movement of a heated fluid (gas or liquid). For example,  an incandescent light bulb will, when heated, become  increasingly hotter until the air surrounding it begins to move.  The motion of the air is upward. This upward motion of the  heated air carries the heat away from the hot light bulb by  convection. Transfer of heat by convection may be hastened  by using a ventilating fan to move the air surrounding a hot  object. The rate of cooling of a hot electronics component,  such as the CPU in a computer, can be increased if it is  provided with copper fins that conduct heat away from the  hot surface. The fins provide large surfaces against which  cool air can be blown.  

A convection process may take place in a liquid as well as in  a gas. A good example of this is a pan of water sitting on the  stove. The bottom of the pan becomes hot because it conducts  heat from the surface it is in contact with. The water on the  bottom of the pan also heats up because of conduction. As  the heated water starts to rise and cooler water moves in to  take its place, the convection process begins.  

When the circulation of gas or liquid is not rapid enough to  remove sufficient heat, fans or pumps are used to accelerate  the motion of the cooling material. In some installations,  pumps are used to circulate water or oil to help cool large  equipment. In airborne installations, electric fans and blowers  are used to aid convection.  

An aircraft air-cooled piston engine is a good example of  convection being used to transfer heat. The engine shown in  Figure 5-29  is a Continental IO-520, with six heavily finned  air-cooled cylinders. This engine does not depend on natural  convection for cooling, but rather forced air convection  coming from the propeller on the engine. The heat generated  inside the engine finds its way to the cylinder cooling fins by  conduction, meaning transfer within the metal of the cylinder.  Once the heat gets to the fins, forced air flowing around the  cylinders carries the heat away.  

# Radiation  

Conduction and convection cannot wholly account for some  of the phenomena associated with heat transfer. For example,  the heat one feels when sitting in front of an open fire cannot  

![](images/b4dc2809afa8b00962dad85700fbbe4ba8514c932aec7487b89101048dd979f8.jpg)  
Figure 5-27.   Conductivity of various metals.  

be transferred by convection because the air currents are  moving toward the fire. It cannot be transferred through  conduction because the conductivity of the air is very small,  and the cooler currents of air moving toward the fire would  more than overcome the transfer of heat outward. Therefore,  there must be some way for heat to travel across space other  than by conduction and convection.  

The existence of another process of heat transfer is still more  evident when the heat from the sun is considered. Since  conduction and convection take place only through some  medium, such as a gas or a liquid, heat from the sun must  reach the earth by another method, since space is an almost  perfect vacuum. Radiation is the name given to this third  method of heat transfer.  

![](images/df8e3a59a794d9114084d1a26057af1393830b3c201cfedc0cb2666350a2555c.jpg)  
Figure 5-28.   Water as a poor conductor.  

The term “radiation” refers to the continual emission of  energy from the surface of all bodies. This energy is known  as “radiant energy.” It is in the form of electromagnetic  waves, radio waves, or x-rays, which are all alike except  for a difference in wave length. These waves travel at the  velocity of light and are transmitted through a vacuum more  easily than through air because air absorbs some of them.  Most forms of energy can be traced back to the energy of  sunlight. Sunlight is a form of radiant heat energy that travels  through space to reach the earth. These electromagnetic  heat waves are absorbed when they come in contact with  nontransparent bodies. The result is that the motion of the  molecules in the body is increased as indicated by an increase  in the temperature of the body.  

The differences between conduction, convection, and radiation  may now be considered. First, although conduction and  convection are extremely slow, radiation takes place at the  speed of light. This fact is evident at the time of an eclipse of  the sun when the shutting off of the heat from the sun takes  place at the same time as the shutting off of the light. Second,  radiant heat may pass through a medium without heating  it. In application, the air inside a greenhouse may be much  warmer than the glass through which the sun’s rays pass. Third,  although heat transfer by conduction or convection may travel  in roundabout routes, radiant heat always travels in a straight  line. For example, radiation can be cut off with a screen placed  between the source of heat and the body to be protected.  

# Specific Heat  

One important way in which substances differ is in the  requirement of different quantities of heat to produce the  same temperature change in a given mass of the substance.  Each substance requires a quantity of heat, called its specific  heat capacity, to increase the temperature of a unit of its  mass  $1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The specific heat of a substance is the ratio of its  specific heat capacity to the specific heat capacity of water.  Specific heat is expressed as a number which, because it is  a ratio, has no units and applies to both the English and the  metric systems.  

It is fortunate that water has a high specific heat capacity.  The larger bodies of water on the earth keep the air and  solid matter on or near the surface of the earth at a constant  temperature. A great quantity of heat is required to change  the temperature of a large lake or river. Therefore, when  the temperature falls below that of such bodies of water,  they give off large quantities of heat. This process keeps  the atmospheric temperature at the surface of the earth from  changing rapidly.  

The specific heat values of some common materials are listed  in  Figure 5-30 .

# Temperature  

Temperature is a dominant factor affecting the physical  properties of fluids. It is of particular concern when  calculating changes in the state of gases.  

The three temperature scales used extensively are the  Centigrade, the Fahrenheit, and the absolute or Kelvin scales.  The Centigrade scale is constructed by using the freezing and  boiling points of water, under standard conditions, as fixed  points of zero and 100, respectively, with 100 equal divisions  between. The Fahrenheit scale uses  $32^{\circ}$   as the freezing point  of water and   $212^{\circ}$   as the boiling point, and has 180 equal  divisions between. The absolute or Kelvin scale is constructed  with its zero point established as minus   $273\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , meaning   $273^{\circ}$   below the freezing point of water. The relationships of  the other fixed points of the scales are shown in  Figure 5-31 .  

When working with temperatures, always make sure which  system of measurement is being used and know how to  convert from one to another. The conversion formulas are  as follows:  

Degrees Fahrenheit  $=$   (1.8 × Degrees Celsius) + 32

 	 Degrees Celsius  $=$  (Degrees Fahrenheit – 32) ×  5 ⁄ 9

 	 Degrees Kelvin  $=$  Degrees Celsius  $+\,273$    

      Degrees Rankine  $=$   Degrees Fahrenheit + 460  

For purposes of calculations, the Rankine scale is commonly  used to convert Fahrenheit to absolute. For Fahrenheit  readings above zero,   $460^{\circ}$   is added. Thus,   $72\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   equals   $460^{\circ}$   plus  $72^{\circ}$  , or  $532^{\circ}$   absolute. If the Fahrenheit reading is  below zero, it is subtracted from  $460^{\circ}$  . Thus  $-40~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   equals   $460^{\circ}$   minus  $40^{\circ}$  , or  $420^{\circ}$   absolute. It should be stressed that  the Rankine scale does not indicate absolute temperature  readings in accordance with the Kelvin scale, but these  conversions may be used for the calculations of changes in  

# Expansion  $=(11\times10^{-6})\times(9\;\mathrm{fect})\times34^{\circ}$  Expansion  $=0.003366$   feet  

The Kelvin and Centigrade scales are used more extensively  in scientific work; therefore, some technical manuals may use  these scales in giving directions and operating instructions.  The Fahrenheit scale is commonly used in the United States,  and most people are familiar with it. Therefore, the Fahrenheit  scale is used in most areas of this book.  

# Thermal Expansion/Contraction  

Thermal expansion takes place in solids, liquids, and  gases when they are heated. With few exceptions, solids  will expand when heated and contract when cooled. The  expansion of solids when heated is very slight in comparison  to the expansion in liquids and gases because the molecules  of solids are much closer together and are more strongly  attracted to each other. The expansion of fluids is discussed  in the study of Boyle’s law. Thermal expansion in solids must  be explained in some detail because of its close relationship  to aircraft metals and materials.  

It is necessary to measure experimentally the exact rate of  expansion of each one because some substances expand more  than others. The amount that a unit length of any substance  expands for a one degree rise in temperature is known as  the coefficient of linear expansion for that substance. The  coefficient of linear expansion for various materials is shown  in  Figure 5-32.  

To estimate the expansion of any object, such as a steel rail,  it is necessary to know three things about it: its length, the  rise in temperature to which it is subjected, and its coefficient  of expansion. This relationship is expressed by the equation:  

Expansion  $=$   (coefficient)  $\times$   (length)  $\times$   (rise in temperature)  

If a steel rod measures exactly 9 ft at  $21\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , what is its length  at  $55\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C?}$   The coefficient of expansion for steel is  $11\times10^{-6}$  .

Figure 5-30.   Specific heat value for various substances.  

This amount, when added to the original length of the rod,  makes the rod 9.003366 ft long. Its length has only increased  by  $\%_{100}$   of an inch.  

The increase in the length of the rod is relatively small, but  if the rod were placed where it could not expand freely,  there would be a tremendous force exerted due to thermal  expansion. Thus, thermal expansion must be taken into  consideration when designing airframes, power plants, or  related equipment.  

# Pressure  

Pressure is the amount of force acting on a specific amount  of surface area. The force is typically measured in pounds  and the surface area in square inches, making the units of  pressure pounds per square inch or psi. If a 100-lb weight  was placed on top of a block with a surface area of   $10\;\mathrm{{in}}^{2}$  ,  the average weight distribution would be   $10~1\textb$   for each of  the square inches   $[100\div10)$  , or 10 psi.  

When atmospheric pressure is being measured, in addition  to psi, other means of pressure measurement can be used.  These include inches or millimeters of mercury, and millibars.  Standard day atmospheric pressure is equal to 14.7 psi, 

 29.92 inches of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  , 760 millimeters of mercury 

  $(\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{bg})$  , or 1013.2 millibars. The relationship between these  units of measure is as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{1\ \mathrm{psi}=2.04\ \mathrm{"Hz}}\\ {1\ \mathrm{psi}=51.7\ \mathrm{mm}\ \mathrm{Hg}}\\ {1\ \mathrm{psi}=68.9\ \mathrm{milliars}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 5-31.   Comparison of temperature scales.  

involves filling a test tube with the liquid mercury and then  covering the top. The test tube is then turned upside down  and placed in an open container of mercury, and the top is  uncovered. Gravity acting on the mercury in the test tube  will try to make the mercury run out. Atmospheric pressure  pushing down on the mercury in the open container tries to  make the mercury stay in the test tube. At some point these two  forces, gravity and atmospheric pressure, will equal out and  the mercury will stabilize at a certain height in the test tube.  Under standard day atmospheric conditions, the air in a  $\scriptstyle{1-\sin^{2}}$  column extending all the way to the top of the atmosphere  would weigh 14.7 lb. A 1 in2 column of mercury, 29.92  inches tall, would also weigh 14.7 lb. That is why 14.7 psi  is equal to 29.92 "Hg.  Figure 5-33  demonstrates this point.  

# Gauge Pressure  

A gauge pressure (psig) is a reading that refers to when an  instrument, such as an oil pressure gauge, fuel pressure gauge,  or hydraulic system pressure gauge, displays pressure which  is over and above ambient. This can be seen on the fuel  pressure gauge shown in  Figure 5-34.  When the oil, fuel, or  hydraulic pump is not turning, and there is no pressure being  created, the gauge will read zero.  

# Absolute Pressure  

A gauge that includes atmospheric pressure in its reading  is measuring what is known as absolute pressure, or psia.  Absolute pressure is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric  pressure. If someone hooked up a psia indicating instrument  to an engine’s oil system, the gauge would read atmospheric  pressure when the engine was not running. Since this would  not make good sense to the typical operator, psia gauges are not  used in this type of application. For the manifold pressure on  a piston engine, a psia gauge does make good sense. Manifold  pressure on a piston engine can read anywhere from less than  atmospheric pressure if the engine is not supercharged, to more  

![Figure 5-32.   Coefficient of expansion for various materials. ](images/f73318d9531e520612b13a54a5d70a8dcc5d77744c3b7881491f208fce551f5f.jpg)  

than atmospheric if it is supercharged. The only gauge that has  the flexibility to show this variety of readings is the absolute  pressure gauge.  Figure 5-35  shows a manifold pressure gauge,  with a readout that ranges from  $10\,"\mathrm{Hg}$   to  $35\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Remember  that  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   is standard day atmospheric.  

# Differential Pressure  

Differential pressure, or psid, is the difference between  pressures being read at two different locations within a  system. For example, in a turbine engine oil system the  pressure is read as it enters the oil filter, and as it leaves the  filter. These two readings are sent to a transmitter which  powers a light located on the flight deck. Across anything  that poses a resistance to flow, like an oil filter, there will  be a drop in pressure. If the filter starts to clog, the pressure  drop will become greater, eventually causing the advisory  light on the flight deck to come on.  

Figure 5-36  shows a differential pressure gauge for the  pressurization system on a Boeing 737. In this case, the  difference in pressure is between the inside and the outside  of the airplane. If the pressure difference becomes too great,  the structure of the airplane could become overstressed.  

# Gas Laws  

The simple structure of gases makes them readily adaptable  to mathematical analysis from which has evolved a detailed  theory of the behavior of gases. This is called the kinetic theory  of gases. The theory assumes that a body of gas is composed of  identical molecules which behave like minute elastic spheres,  spaced relatively far apart and continuously in motion.  

The degree of molecular motion is dependent upon the  temperature of the gas. Since the molecules are continuously  striking against each other and against the walls of the  container, an increase in temperature with the resulting  increase in molecular motion causes a corresponding  increase in the number of collisions between the molecules.  The increased number of collisions results in an increase in  pressure because a greater number of molecules strike against  the walls of the container in a given unit of time.  

If the container were an open vessel, the gas would expand  and overflow from the container. However, if the container  is sealed and possesses elasticity, such as a rubber balloon,  the increased pressure causes the container to expand. For  instance, when making a long drive on a hot day, the pressure  in the tires of an automobile increases, and a tire which  appeared to be somewhat “soft” in cool morning temperature  may appear normal at a higher midday temperature.  

Such phenomena as these have been explained and set forth  in the form of laws pertaining to gases and tend to support

the kinetic theory.  

# Boyle’s Law  

As previously stated, compressibility is an outstanding  characteristic of gases. The English scientist, Robert Boyle,  was among the first to study this characteristic that he called  the “springiness of air.” By direct measurement he discovered  that when the temperature of a combined sample of gas was  

![](images/1e3e1bd2ef5e5d62326b7f3f7a1249dedb1f27abae286b239a24f5f2b819cf09.jpg)  
Figure 5-34.   Psig read on a fuel pressure gauge.  

kept constant and the absolute pressure doubled, the volume  was reduced to half the former value. As the applied absolute  pressure was decreased, the resulting volume increased.  From these observations, he concluded that for a constant  temperature the product of the volume and absolute pressure  of an enclosed gas remains constant. Boyle’s law is normally  stated: “The volume of an enclosed dry gas varies inversely  with its absolute pressure, provided the temperature remains  constant.” The following formula is used for Boyle’s law  calculations. Remember, pressure needs to be in the absolute.  

$$
\mathrm{V}_{1}\mathrm{P}_{1}=\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{P}_{2}
$$  

Example:   $10~\mathrm{ft}^{3}$   of nitrogen is under a pressure of 500 psia.  If the volume is reduced to  $7\;\mathrm{ft}^{3}$  , what will the new pressure  be?  [Figure 5-37]  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{V}_{1}\mathrm{P}_{1}=\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{P}_{2}}\\ {10\;(500)=7\;(\mathrm{P}_{2})}\\ {10\;(500)\div7=\mathrm{P}_{2}}\\ {\mathrm{P}_{2}=714.29\;\mathrm{psi}}\end{array}
$$  

The useful applications of Boyle’s law are many and varied.  Some applications more common to aviation are: (1) the  carbon dioxide   $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$   bottle used to inflate life rafts and life  vests; (2) the compressed oxygen and the acetylene tanks  used in welding; (3) the compressed air brakes and shock  absorbers; and (4) the use of oxygen tanks for high altitude  flying and emergency use.

# Charles’ Law  

The French scientist, Jacques Charles, provided much of the  foundation for the modern kinetic theory of gases. He found  that all gases expand and contract in direct proportion to the  change in the absolute temperature, provided the pressure is  held constant. As a formula, this law is shown as follows:  

Volume  $1\times$   Absolute Temperature  $2=$  Volume  $2\times$   Absolute Temperature 1  

$$
\mathrm{V}_{1}\mathrm{T}_{2}=\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{T}_{1}
$$  

Charles’ law also works if the volume is held constant, and  pressure and temperature are the variables. In this case, the  formula would be as follows:  

$$
\mathrm{P}_{1}\mathrm{T}_{2}=\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{T}_{1}
$$  

For this second formula, pressure and temperature must be  in the absolute.  

Example: A 15-ft 3  cylinder of oxygen is at a temperature of   $70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and a pressure of 750 psig. The cylinder is placed in the  sun and the temperature of the oxygen increases to   $140\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  What would be the new pressure in psig?  

70 degrees Fahrenheit  $=530$   degrees Rankine  140 degrees Fahrenheit  $=600$   degrees Rankine	  $750\,\mathrm{psig}+14.7=764.7$   psia  

$$
\mathrm{P}_{1}\mathrm{T}_{2}=\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{T}_{1}
$$  

$$
764.7\left(600\right)=\mathrm{P}_{2}\left(530\right)
$$  

$\mathrm{P}_{2}=764.7\,(600)\div530$  

# General Gas Law  

By combining Boyle’s and Charles’ laws, a single expression  can be derived which states all the information contained in  both. The formula which is used to express the general gas  law is as follows:  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{Pressure\1\(Volume\ 1)}}{\mathrm{Termcirc\1}}\ =\ \frac{\mathrm{Pressure\2\(Volume\ 2)}}{\mathrm{Termcirc}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{P_{1}\left(V_{1}\right)\left(T_{2}\right)=P_{2}\left(V_{2}\right)\left(T_{1}\right)}
$$  

When using the general gas law formula, temperature and  pressure must be in the absolute.  

Example: 20 ft 3  of the gas argon is compressed to   $15~\mathrm{ft}^{3}$  .  The gas starts out at a temperature of   $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and a pressure of  1,000 psig. After being compressed, its temperature is  $90\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  What would its new pressure be in psig?  

60 degrees Fahrenheit  $=520$   degrees Rankine	 90 degrees Fahrenheit  $=550$   degrees Rankine  

$$
\mathrm{P_{1}\left(V_{1}\right)\left(T_{2}\right)=P_{2}\left(V_{2}\right)\left(T_{1}\right)}
$$  

$$
1{,}014.7\left(20\right)\left(550\right)=\mathrm{P}_{2}\left(15\right)\left(520\right.
$$  

# Dalton’s Law  

If a mixture of two or more gases that do not combine  chemically is placed in a container, each gas expands  throughout the total space and the absolute pressure of each  gas is reduced to a lower value, called its partial pressure. This  

![](images/5c64b86ab56d34a1c4acfc224aab8c3341d6e900d34dcf3bf70aa5835483fd10.jpg)  
Figure 5-37.   Boyle’s law example.  

reduction is in accordance with Boyle’s law. The pressure of  the mixed gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures.  This fact was discovered by Dalton, an English physicist,  and is set forth in Dalton’s law: “A mixture of several gases  which do not react chemically exerts a pressure equal to the  sum of the pressures which the several gases would exert  separately if each were allowed to occupy the entire space  alone at the given temperature.”  

# Fluid Mechanics  

By definition, a fluid is any substance that is able to flow if it  is not in some way confined or restricted. Liquids and gases  are both classified as fluids, and often act in a very similar  way. One significant difference comes into play when a  force is applied to these fluids. In this case, liquids tend  to be incompressible and gases are highly compressible.  Many of the principles that aviation is based on, such as  the theory of lift on a wing and the force generated by a  hydraulic system, can be explained and quantified by using  the laws of fluid mechanics.  

# Buoyancy  

A solid body submerged in a liquid or a gas weighs less than  when weighed in free space. This is because of the upward  force, called buoyant force, which any fluid exerts on a body  submerged in it. An object will float if this upward force of the  fluid is greater than the weight of the object. Objects denser  than the fluid, even though they sink readily, appear to lose  a part of their weight when submerged. A person can lift a  larger weight under water than they can possibly lift in the air.  

The following experiment is illustrated in  Figure 5-38 . The  overflow can is filled to the spout with water. The heavy  metal cube is first weighed in still air and weighs 10 lb. It is  then weighed while completely submerged in the water and  it weighs 3 lb. The difference between the two weights is  the buoyant force of the water. As the cube is lowered into  the overflow can, the water is caught in the catch bucket.  The volume of water which overflows equals the volume  of the cube. The volume of irregular shaped objects can  also be measured by using this method. If this experiment  is performed carefully, the weight of the water displaced by  the metal cube exactly equals the buoyant force of the water,  which the scale shows to be 7 lb.  

Archimedes (287–212 B.C.) performed similar experiments.  As a result, he discovered that the buoyant force which a fluid  exerts upon a submerged body is equal to the weight of the fluid  the body displaces. This statement is referred to as Archimedes’  principle. This principle applies to all fluids, gases as well as  liquids. Just as water exerts a buoyant force on submerged  objects, air exerts a buoyant force on objects submerged in it.  

The amount of buoyant force available to an object can be  calculated by using the following formula:  

Buoyant Force  $=$   V olume of Object  $\times$   Density of Fluid Displaced If the buoyant force is more than the object weighs, the object  will float. If the buoyant force is less than the object weighs,  the object will sink. For the object that sinks, its measurable  weight will be less by the weight of the displaced fluid.  

Example: A 10-ft 3  object weighing 700 lb is placed in pure  water. Will the object float? If the object sinks, what is  its measurable weight in the submerged condition? If the  object floats, how many cubic feet of its volume is below  the water line?  

Buoyant Force  $=$   V olume of Object  $\times$   Density of Fluid Displaced

 	  $=10$   (62.4)

 	  $=624\,\mathsf{l b}$  

The object will sink because the buoyant force is less than the  object weighs. The difference between the buoyant force and  the object’s weight will be its measurable weight, or 76 lb.  

Two good examples of buoyancy are a helium filled  airship and a seaplane on floats. An airship is able to float  in the atmosphere and a seaplane is able to float on water.  That means both have more buoyant force than weight.  Figure 5-39  is a DeHavilland Twin Otter seaplane, with a  gross takeoff weight of 12,500 lb. At a minimum, the floats  on this airplane must be large enough to displace a weight  in water equal to the airplane’s weight. According to Title  14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 23, the  floats must be 80 percent larger than the minimum needed  to support the airplane. For this airplane, the necessary size  of the floats would be calculated as follows:  

Divide the airplane weight by the density of water.   $12{,}500\div62.4=200.3\$   ft 3  

Multiply this volume by  $80\%$   $200.3\times80\%=160.2$   ft 3  

Add the two volumes together to get the total volume of  the floats.  $200.3+160.2=360.5$   ft 3  

By looking at the Twin Otter in  Figure 5-39 , it is obvious  that much of the volume of the floats is out of the water. This  is accomplished by making sure the floats have at least 80  percent more volume than the minimum necessary.  

Some of the large Goodyear airships have a volume of  230,000 ft 3 . Since the fluid they are submerged in is air,  to find the buoyant force of the airship, the volume of the  airship is multiplied by the density of air   $(.07651\,\%_{\mathrm{f}^{3}})$  ). For this  Goodyear airship, the buoyant force is 17,597 lb.  Figure 5-40 shows an inside view of the Goodyear airship.  

The forward and aft ballonets are air chambers within the  airship. Through the air scoop, air can be pumped into  the ballonets or evacuated from the ballonets in order to  control the weight of the airship. Controlling the weight of  the airship controls how much positive or negative lift it  has. Although the airship is classified as a lighter-than-air  aircraft, it is in fact flown in a condition slightly heavier  than air.  

# Fluid Pressure  

The pressure exerted on the bottom of a container by a  liquid is determined by the height of the liquid and not by  the shape of the container. This can be seen in  Figure 5-41 ,  where three different shapes and sizes of containers are full  of colored water. Even though they are different shapes and  have different volumes of liquid, each one has a height of  231 inches. Each one would exert a pressure on the bottom  of 8.34 psi because of this height. The container on the left,  with a surface area of   $1\ \mathrm{in}^{2}$  , contains a volume of   $231\ \mathrm{in}^{3}$  (one gallon). One gallon of water weighs   $8.34\,\mathrm{lb}$  , which is  why the pressure on the bottom is 8.34 psi.  

![](images/24dd2bc16d3504076f2f76139086b42f1a0996766d4360a0537beb04ba7f0552.jpg)  
Figure 5-38.   Example of buoyancy.  

Still thinking about  Figure 5-41 , if the pressure was measured  half way down, it would be half of 8.34, or 4.17 psi. In other  words, the pressure is adjustable by varying the height of the  column. Pressure based on the column height of a fluid is  known as static pressure. With liquids, such as gasoline, it  is sometimes referred to as a head of pressure. For example,  if a carburetor needs to have 2 psi supplied to its inlet, or  head of pressure, this could be accomplished by having the  fuel tank positioned the appropriate number of inches higher  than the carburetor.  

As identified in the previous paragraph, pressure due to the  height of a fluid column is known as static pressure. When  a fluid is in motion, and its velocity is converted to pressure,  that pressure is known as ram. When ram pressure and static  pressure are added together, the result is known as total  pressure. In the inlet of a gas turbine engine, for example,  total pressure is often measured to provide a signal to the  fuel metering device or to provide a signal to a gauge on  the flight deck.  

# Pascal’s Law  

The foundations of modern hydraulics and pneumatics were  established in 1653 when Pascal discovered that pressure set  up in a fluid acts equally in all directions. This pressure acts  at right angles to containing surfaces. When the pressure in  the fluid is caused solely by the fluid’s height, the pressure  against the walls of the container is equal at any given level,  but it is not equal if the pressure at the bottom is compared to  the pressure half way down. The concept of the pressure set  up in a fluid, and how it relates to the force acting on the fluid  and the surface area through which it acts, is Pascal’s law.  

In  Figure 5-41 , if a piston is placed at the top of the cylinder  and an external force pushes down on the piston, additional  pressure will be created in the liquid. If the additional pressure  is 100 psi, this 100 psi will act equally and undiminished  from the top of the cylinder all the way to the bottom. The  

![](images/2a80816e5135fbb7ba2d8af90bc08a34cc06609b9b61ab20762cc1546ec2d20e.jpg)  
Figure 5-39.   DeHavilland Twin Otter seaplane.  

gauge at the bottom will now read 108.34 psi, and if a gauge  were positioned half way down the cylinder, it would read  104.17 psi, which is found by adding 100 plus half of 8.34.  

Pascal’s law, when dealing with the variables of force, pressure,  and area, is dealt with by way of the following formula.  

#  $\mathrm{Force}=\mathrm{pressure}\times\mathrm{Area}$  

In this formula, the force is in units of pounds, the pressure  is in pounds per square inch (psi), and the area is in square  inches. By transposing the original formula, we have two  additional formulas, as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Pressure=Force\divArea}}\\ &{\mathrm{\qquad\quad\and}}\\ &{\mathrm{Area=Force\divresure}}\end{array}
$$  

An easy and convenient way to remember the formulas for  Pascal’s law, and the relationship between the variables, is  with the triangle shown in  Figure 5-42 . If the variable we  want to solve for is covered up, the position of the remaining  two variables shows the proper math relationship. For  example, if the “A,” or area, is covered up, what remains is  the “F” on the top and the “P” on the bottom, meaning force  divided by pressure.  

The simple hydraulic system in  Figure 5-43  has 5 lb force  acting on a piston with a  $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{1}}/_{2-i{\mathrm{n}}^{2}}$   surface area. Based on Pascal’s  law, the pressure in the system would be equal to the force  applied divided by the area of the piston, or 10 psi. As shown  in  Figure 5-43 , the pressure of 10 psi is present everywhere  in the fluid.  

The hydraulic system in  Figure 5-44  is a little more complex  than the one in  Figure 5-43 . In  Figure 5-44 , the input force  of   $5~1\mathrm{b}$   is acting on a   $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{1}}/_{2}-\sin^{2}$   piston, creating a pressure of  10 psi. The input cylinder and piston is connected to a second  

![](images/d6035a7c52411a155e0b4f0a7714cedb3396f98d0eed48b64115988b5eb97215.jpg)

cylinder, which contains a  ${\mathsf{5}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{n}}^{2}$   piston. The pressure of 10 psi  created by the input piston pushes on the piston in the second  cylinder, creating an output force of 50 pounds.  

Often, the purpose of a hydraulic system is to generate a  large output force, with the input force being much less.  In  Figure 5-44 , the input force is 5 lb and the output force  is   $50~1\textb$  , or 10 times greater. The relationship between  the output force and the input force, as discussed earlier  in this chapter, is known as mechanical advantage. The  mechanical advantage in  Figure 5-44  would be 50 divided  by 5, or 10. The following formulas can be used to calculate  mechanical advantage.  

Mechanical Advantage  $=$   Force Out  $\div$   Force In or  

Mechanical Advantage  Distance Out  Distance In  

Earlier in this chapter when simple machines, such as levers  and gears were discussed, it was identified that no machine  allows us to gain work. The same statement holds true for a  hydraulic system, that we get no more work out of a hydraulic  system than we put in. Since work is equal to force times  distance, if we gain force with a hydraulic system, we must  lose distance. We only get the same work out, if the system  is 100 percent efficient.  

In order to think about the distance that the output piston will  move in response to the movement of the input piston, the  volume of fluid displaced must be considered. In the study  of geometry, one learns that the volume of a cylinder is equal  to the cylinder’s surface area multiplied by its height. So,  when a piston of  $2\,\mathrm{in}^{2}$   moves down in a cylinder a distance of   $10\;\mathrm{in}$  , it displaces a volume of fluid equal to  $20\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$     $2\;\mathrm{in}^{2}\times$     $10\,\mathrm{in}$  ). The  $20\,\mathrm{in}^{3}$   displaced by the first piston is what moves  over to the second cylinder and causes its piston to move.  In a simple two-piston hydraulic system, the relationship  between the piston area and the distance moved is shown  by the following formula.  

Input Piston Area (Distance Moved)  $=$  Output Piston Area (Distance Moved)  

This formula shows that the volume in is equal to the volume  out. This concept is shown in  Figure 5-45 , where a small input  piston moves a distance of 20 inches, and the larger output  piston only moves a distance of 1 inch.  

Example: A two-piston hydraulic system, like that shown in  Figure 5-45 , has an input piston with an area of    $\%\,\mathrm{in}^{2}$   and  an output piston with an area of   $15~\mathrm{in}^{2}$  . An input force of  50 lb is applied, and the input piston moves 30 inches. What  is the pressure in the system, how much force is generated  by the output piston, how far would the output piston move,  and what is the mechanical advantage?

Part of understanding Pascal’s law and hydraulics involves  utilizing formulas, and recognizing the relationship  between the individual variables. Before the numbers are  plugged into the formulas, it is often possible to analyze  the variables in the system and come to a realization about  what is happening. For example, look at the variables in  Figure   $5{\mathrm{-}}45$   and notice that the output piston is 20 times  larger than the input piston,   $5\;\mathrm{in}^{2}$   compared to  $\%\;\mathrm{in}^{2}$  . That  comparison tells us that the output force will be 20 times  greater than the input force, and also that the output piston  will only move  $\%$   as far. Without doing any formula based  calculations, we can conclude that the hydraulic system in  question has a mechanical advantage of 20.  

# Bernoulli’s Principle  

Bernoulli’s principle was originally stated to explain the  action of a liquid flowing through the varying cross-sectional  

![](images/1be4055b7266c056ad478af6821a10637efab61444b891bb851588b2365c27dc.jpg)

areas of tubes. In  Figure 5-46  a tube is shown in which  the cross-sectional area gradually decreases to a minimum  diameter in its center section. A tube constructed in this  manner is called a “venturi,” or “venturi tube.” Where the  cross-sectional area is decreasing, the passageway is referred  to as a converging duct. As the passageway starts to spread  out, it is referred to as a diverging duct.  

As a liquid, or fluid, flows through the venturi tube, the  gauges at points “A,” “B,” and “C” are positioned to register  the velocity and the static pressure of the liquid. The venturi  in  Figure 5-46  can be used to illustrate Bernoulli’s principle,  which states that: The static pressure of a fluid, liquid or gas,  decreases at points where the velocity of the fluid increases,  provided no energy is added to nor taken away from the  fluid. The velocity of the air is kinetic energy and the static  pressure of the air is potential energy.  

In the wide section of the venturi (points A and C of  Figure 5-46 ), the liquid moves at low velocity, producing a  high static pressure, as indicated by the pressure gauge. As the  tube narrows in the center, it must contain the same volume  of fluid as the two end areas. As indicated by the velocity  gauge reading high and the pressure gauge reading low, in  this narrow section, the liquid moves at a higher velocity,  producing a lower pressure than that at points A and C. A  good application for the use of the venturi principle is in a  float-type carburetor. As the air flows through the carburetor  on its way to the engine, it goes through a venturi, where the  static pressure is reduced. The fuel in the carburetor, which is  under a higher pressure, flows into the lower pressure venturi  area and mixes with the air.  

Bernoulli’s principle is extremely important in understanding  how some of the systems used in aviation work, including  how the wing of an airplane generates lift or why the inlet  duct of a turbine engine on a subsonic airplane is diverging  in shape. The wing on a slow-moving airplane has a curved

top surface and a relatively flat bottom surface. The curved  top surface acts like half of the converging shaped middle  of a venturi. As the air flow over the top of the wing, the  air speeds up, and its static pressure decreases. The static  pressure on the bottom of the wing is now greater than the  pressure on the top, and this pressure difference creates the  lift on the wing. Bernoulli’s principle and the concept of lift  on a wing are covered in greater depth in “Aircraft Theory  of Flight” located in this chapter.  

# Sound  

Sound has been defined as a series of disturbances in matter  that the human ear can detect. This definition can also be  applied to disturbances which are beyond the range of human  hearing. There are three elements which are necessary for the  transmission and reception of sound. These are the source, a  medium for carrying the sound, and the detector. Anything  which moves back and forth, or vibrates, and disturbs the  medium around it may be considered a sound source.  

An example of the production and transmission of sound  is the ring of a bell. When the bell is struck and begins to  vibrate, the particles of the medium, or the surrounding air, in  contact with the bell also vibrate. The vibrational disturbance  is transmitted from one particle of the medium to the next,  and the vibrations travel in a “wave” through the medium  until they reach the ear. The eardrum, acting as detector, is  set in motion by the vibrating particles of air, and the brain  interprets the eardrum’s vibrations as the characteristic sound  associated with a bell.  

# Wave Motion  

Since sound is a wave motion in matter, it can best be  understood by first considering water waves, like a series  of circular waves travel away from the disturbance of an  object thrown into a pool. In  Figure 5-47  such waves are  seen from a top perspective, with the waves traveling  out from the center. In the cross-section perspective in  Figure 5-47 , notice that the water waves are a succession  of crests and troughs. The wavelength is the distance from  the crest of one wave to the crest of the next. Water waves  are known as transverse waves because the motion of the  water molecules is up and down, or at right angles to the  direction in which the waves are traveling. This can be seen  by observing a cork on the water, bobbing up and down as  the waves pass by.  

Sound travels through matter in the form of longitudinal wave  motions. These waves are called longitudinal waves because the  particles of the medium vibrate back and forth longitudinally  in the direction of propagation.  [Figure 5-48]  When the  tine of a tuning fork moves in an outward direction, the air  immediately in front of the tine is compressed so that its  momentary pressure is raised above that at other points in the  surrounding medium. Because air is elastic, this disturbance  is transmitted progressively in an outward direction from the  tine in the form of a compression wave.  

When the tine returns and moves in an inward direction,  the air in front of the tine is rarefied so that its momentary  pressure is reduced below that at other points in the  surrounding medium. This disturbance is transmitted in the  form of a rarefaction, or expansion, wave and follows the  compression wave through the medium. The progress of  any wave involves two distinct motions: (1) The wave itself  moves forward with constant speed, and (2) simultaneously,  the particles of the medium that convey the wave vibrate  harmonically. Examples of harmonic motion are the motion  of a clock pendulum, the balance wheel in a watch, and the  piston in a reciprocating engine.  

# Speed of Sound  

In any uniform medium, under given physical conditions,  the sound travels at a definite speed. In some substances, the  velocity of sound is higher than in others. Even in the same  medium under different conditions of temperature, pressure,  and so forth, the velocity of sound varies. Density and  elasticity of a medium are the two basic physical properties  which govern the velocity of sound.  

In general, a difference in density between two substances  is sufficient to indicate which one will be the faster  transmission medium for sound. For example, sound travels  faster through water than it does through air at the same  temperature. However, there are some surprising exceptions  to this rule of thumb. An outstanding example among these  exceptions involves comparison of the speed of sound in  lead and aluminum at the same temperature. Sound travels  at 16,700 fps in aluminum at   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , and only 4,030 fps  

![](images/73af11e7b6149117c97a4d288e654e800f05156c39e22908a63c0aa85e0b70a4.jpg)  
Figure 5-46.   Bernoulli’s principle and a venturi.  

in lead at   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , despite the fact that lead is much denser  than aluminum. The reason for such exceptions is found in  the fact, mentioned above, that sound velocity depends on  elasticity as well as density.  

Using density as a rough indication of the speed of sound  in a given substance, it can be stated as a general rule that  sound travels fastest in solid materials, slower in liquids, and  slowest in gases. The velocity of sound in air at   $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  is 1,087 fps and increases by 2 fps for each Centigrade degree  of temperature rise, or 1.1 fps for each degree Fahrenheit.  

# Mach Number  

In the study of aircraft that fly at supersonic speeds, it is  customary to discuss aircraft speed in relation to the velocity  of sound, which is approximately 761 miles per hour (mph)  at   $59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The term “Mach number” has been given to the  ratio of the speed of an aircraft to the speed of sound, in  honor of Ernst Mach, an Austrian scientist. If the speed of  sound at sea level is  $761\;\mathrm{mph}$  , an aircraft flying at a Mach  number of 1.2 at sea level would be traveling at a speed of   $761\ \mathrm{mph}\times1.2=913\ \mathrm{mph}$  .  

# Frequency of Sound  

The term “pitch” is used to describe the frequency of a sound.  The outstanding recognizable difference between the tones  produced by two different keys on a piano is a difference in  pitch. The pitch of a tone is proportional to the number of  compressions and rarefactions received per second, which  in turn, is determined by the vibration frequency of the  sounding source. A good example of frequency is the noise  generated by a turbofan engine on a commercial airliner. The  

![](images/729723eb6c89a115d5a3284753131c690ec5bf27eb91af67dabf2329db59527c.jpg)  
Figure 5-47.   Relationship between sound and waves in water.  

high tip speeds of the fan in the front of the engine create  a high frequency sound, and the hot exhaust creates a low  frequency sound.  

# Loudness  

When a bell rings, the sound waves spread out in all directions  and the sound is heard in all directions. When a bell is struck  lightly, the vibrations are of small amplitude and the sound  is weak. A stronger blow produces vibrations of greater  amplitude in the bell, and the sound is louder. It is evident  that the amplitude of the air vibrations is greater when the  amplitude of the vibrations of the source is increased. Hence,  the loudness of the sound depends on the amplitude of the  vibrations of the sound waves. As the distance from the  source increases, the energy in each wave spreads out, and  the sound becomes weaker.  

As the sound wave advances, variations in pressure occur  at all points in the transmitting medium. The greater the  pressure variations, the more intense the sound wave is.  The intensity is proportional to the square of the pressure  variation regardless of the frequency. Thus, by measuring  pressure changes, the intensities of sounds having different  frequencies can be compared directly.  

# Measurement of Sound Intensity  

Sound intensity is measured in decibels, with a decibel  being the ratio of one sound to another. One decibel (dB)  is the smallest change in sound intensity the human ear can  detect. A faint whisper would have an intensity of  $20\,\mathrm{dB}$  , and  a pneumatic drill would be   $80\ \mathrm{dB}$  . The engine on a modern  jetliner, at takeoff thrust, would have a sound intensity of   $90\,\mathrm{dB}$   when heard by someone standing 150 ft. away. A 110 dB  

![](images/db69e507672597a6150ab5716f2631a15b03bfcea3764336ae572b6951cc418d.jpg)  
Figure 5-48.   Sound propagation by a tuning fork.  

noise, by comparison, would sound twice as loud as the  jetliner’s engine.  Figure 5-49  shows the sound intensity from  a variety of different sources.  

# Doppler Effect  

When sound is coming from a moving object, the object’s  forward motion adds to the frequency as sensed from the front  and takes away from the frequency as sensed from the rear.  This change in frequency is known as the Doppler Effect, and  it explains why the sound from an airplane seems different as it  approaches compared to how it sounds as it flies overhead. As  it approaches, it becomes both louder and higher pitched. As  it flies away, the loudness and pitch both decrease noticeably.  If an airplane is flying at or higher than the speed of sound,  the sound energy cannot travel out ahead of the airplane,  because the airplane catches up to it the instant it tries to  leave. The sound energy being created by the airplane piles  up, and attaches itself to the structure of the airplane. As the  airplane approaches, a person standing on the ground will not  be able to hear it until it gets past their position, because the  sound energy is actually trailing behind the airplane. When  the sound of the airplane is heard, it will be in the form of  what is called a sonic boom.  

# Resonance  

All types of matter, regardless of whether it is a solid, liquid,  or gas, have a natural frequency at which the atoms within  that matter vibrate. If two pieces of matter have the same  natural frequency, and one of them starts to vibrate, it can  transfer its wave energy to the other one and cause it to  vibrate. This transfer of energy is known as resonance. Some  piston engine powered airplanes have an rpm range that they  are placarded to avoid, because spinning the prop at that  rpm can cause vibration problems. The difficulty lies in the  natural frequency of the metal in the prop, and the frequency  of vibration that will be set up with a particular tip speed for  the prop. At that particular rpm, stresses can be set up that  could lead to the propeller coming apart.  

# The Atmosphere  

Aviation is so dependent upon that category of fluids called  gases and the effect of forces and pressures acting upon gases  that a discussion of the subject of the atmosphere is important  to the persons maintaining and repairing aircraft.  

Data available about the atmosphere may determine whether  a flight will succeed, or whether it will even become airborne.  The various components of the air around the earth, the  changes in temperatures and pressures at different levels  above the earth, the properties of weather encountered by  aircraft in flight, and many other detailed data are considered  in the preparation of flight plans.  

Pascan and Torricelli have been credited with developing  the barometer, an instrument for measuring atmospheric  pressure. The results of their experiments are still used today  with very little improvement in design or knowledge. They  determined that air has weight which changes as altitude is  changed with respect to sea level. Today scientists are also  interested in how the atmosphere affects the performance of  the aircraft and its equipment.  

# Composition of the Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is a complex and ever changing mixture. Its  ingredients vary from place to place and from day to day.  In addition to a number of gases, it contains quantities of  foreign matter such as pollen, dust, bacteria, soot, volcanic  ash, spores, and dust from outer space. The composition  of the air remains almost constant from sea level up to  its highest level, but its density diminishes rapidly with  altitude. Six miles up, for example, it is too thin to support  respiration, and 12 miles up, there is not enough oxygen  to support combustion, except in some specially designed  turbine engine powered airplanes. At a point several  hundred miles above the earth, some gas particles spray out  into space, some are dragged by gravity and fall back into  the ocean of air below, while others never return. Physicists  disagree as to the boundaries of the outer fringes of the  atmosphere. Some think it begins 240 miles above the earth  and extends to 400 miles; others place its lower edge at  

![](images/2348d4fdb3b02c28cfae26a7a49913e1e9c784bd36adaa27d5ed3c9efa713fb6.jpg)  
Figure 5-49.   Sound intensity from different sources.  

There are also certain nonconformities at various levels.  Between 12 and 30 miles, high solar ultraviolet radiation  reacts with oxygen molecules to produce a thin curtain of  ozone, a very poisonous gas without which life on earth could  not exist. This ozone filters out a portion of the sun’s lethal  ultraviolet rays, allowing only enough coming through to  give us sunburn, kill bacteria, and prevent rickets. At 50 to  65 miles up, most of the oxygen molecules begin to break  down under solar radiation into free atoms, and to form  hydroxyl ions (OH) from water vapor. Also in this region,  all the atoms become ionized.  

Studies of the atmosphere have revealed that the temperature  does not decrease uniformly with increasing altitude; instead it  gets steadily colder up to a height of about 7 miles, where the  rate of temperature change slows down abruptly and remains  almost constant at  $-55^{\circ}$   Centigrade (  $218^{\circ}$   Kelvin) up to about  20 miles. Then the temperature begins to rise to a peak value of   $77^{\circ}$   Centigrade (  $350^{\circ}$   Kelvin) at the 55 mile level. Thereafter it  climbs steadily, reaching  $_{2,270^{\circ}}$   Centigrade   $(2{,}543^{\circ}\operatorname{Kelvin})$  ) at  a height of 250 to 400 miles. From the 50 mile level upward, a  man or any other living creature, without the protective cover  of the atmosphere, would be broiled on the side facing the sun  and frozen on the other.  

The atmosphere is divided into concentric layers or levels.  Transition through these layers is gradual and without sharply  defined boundaries. However, one boundary, the tropopause,  exists between the first and second layer. The tropopause is  defined as the point in the atmosphere at which the decrease  in temperature, with increasing altitude, abruptly ceases. The  four atmosphere layers are the troposphere, stratosphere,  ionosphere, and the exosphere. The upper portion of the  stratosphere is often called the chemosphere or ozonosphere,  and the exosphere is also known as the mesosphere.  

The troposphere extends from the earth’s surface to about  35,000 ft at middle latitudes, but varies from 28,000 ft at the  poles to about 54,000 ft at the equator. The troposphere is  characterized by large changes in temperature and humidity and  by generally turbulent conditions. Nearly all cloud formations  are within the troposphere. Approximately three-fourths of the  total weight of the atmosphere is within the troposphere. The  stratosphere extends from the upper limits of the troposphere  and the tropopause to an average altitude of 60 miles.  

The ionosphere ranges from the 50-mile level to a level of  300 to 600 miles. Little is known about the characteristics  of the ionosphere, but it is thought that many electrical  phenomena occur there. Basically, this layer is characterized  by the presence of ions and free electrons, and the ionization  

# Atmospheric Density  

The exosphere, or mesosphere, is the outer layer of the  atmosphere. It begins at an altitude of 600 miles and extends  to the limits of the atmosphere. In this layer, the temperature  is fairly constant at  $_{2,500^{\circ}}$   Kelvin, and propagation of sound  is thought to be impossible due to lack of molecular substance.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

The human body is under pressure, since it exists at the  bottom of a sea of air. This pressure is due to the weight of the  atmosphere. On a standard day at sea level, if a  $\scriptstyle{1-\sin^{2}}$   column  of air extending to the top of the atmosphere was weighed, it  would weigh 14.7 lb. That is why standard day atmospheric  pressure is said to be 14.7 pounds per square inch (14.7 psi).  

Since atmospheric pressure at any altitude is due to the weight  of air above it, pressure decreases with increased altitude.  Obviously, the total weight of air above an area at 15,000 ft  would be less than the total weight of the air above an area  at 10,000 ft.  

Atmospheric pressure is often measured by a mercury  barometer. A glass tube somewhat over 30 inches in length  is sealed at one end and then filled with mercury. It is then  inverted and the open end placed in a dish of mercury.  Immediately, the mercury level in the inverted tube will drop  a short distance, leaving a small volume of mercury vapor at  nearly zero absolute pressure in the tube just above the top of  the liquid mercury column. Gravity acting on the mercury in  the tube will try to make the mercury run out. Atmospheric  pressure pushing down on the mercury in the open container  tries to make the mercury stay in the tube. At some point these  two forces (gravity and atmospheric pressure) will equilibrate  out and the mercury will stabilize at a certain height in the  tube. Under standard day atmospheric conditions, the air in a  1 square inch column extending to the top of the atmosphere  would weigh 14.7 lb. A 1-in 2  column of mercury, 29.92 inches
 tall, would also weigh 14.7 lb. That is why 14.7 psi is equal  to 29.92 "Hg.  Figure 5-50  demonstrates this point.  

A second means of measuring atmospheric pressure is with  an aneroid barometer. This mechanical instrument is a much  better choice than a mercury barometer for use on airplanes.  Aneroid barometers, or altimeters, are used to indicate  altitude in flight. The calibrations are made in thousands of  feet rather than in psi or inches of mercury. For example, the  standard pressure at sea level is  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , or 14.7 psi. At  10,000 feet above sea level, standard pressure is  $20.58\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  or 10.10 psi. Altimeters are calibrated so that if the pressure  exerted by the atmosphere is   $10.10\ \mathrm{psi}$  , the altimeter will  point to 10,000 ft.  [Figure 5-51]  

Since both temperature and pressure decrease with altitude,  it might appear that the density of the atmosphere would  remain fairly constant with increased altitude. This is not  true, however, because pressure drops more rapidly with  increased altitude than does the temperature. The result is  that density decreases with increased altitude.  

By use of the general gas law, studied earlier, it can be shown  that for a particular gas, pressure and temperature determine  the density. Since standard pressure and temperatures have  been associated with each altitude, the density of the air  at these standard temperatures and pressures must also be  considered standard. Thus, a particular atmospheric density is  associated with each altitude. This gives rise to the expression  “density altitude,” symbolized “Hd.” A density altitude of  15,000 ft is the altitude at which the density is the same as  that considered standard for 15,000 ft. Remember, however,  that density altitude is not necessarily true altitude. For  example, on a day when the atmospheric pressure is higher  than standard and the temperature is lower than standard,  the density which is standard at 10,000 ft might occur at  12,000 ft. In this case, at an actual altitude of 12,000 ft, we  have air that has the same density as standard air at 10,000 ft.  Density altitude is a calculated altitude obtained by correcting  pressure altitude for temperature.  

# Water Content of the Atmosphere  

In the troposphere, the air is rarely completely dry. It contains  water vapor in one of two forms: (1) fog or (2) water vapor.  Fog consists of minute droplets of water held in suspension by  the air. Clouds are composed of fog. The height to which some  clouds extend is a good indication of the presence of water in  the atmosphere almost up to the stratosphere. The presence of  water vapor in the air is quite evident in  Figure 5-52 , with a  military F-18 doing a high-speed fly-by at nearly Mach 1. The  temperature and pressure changes that occur as the airplane  approaches supersonic flight cause the water vapor in the air  to condense and form the vapor cloud that is visible.  

As a result of evaporation, the atmosphere always contains  some moisture in the form of water vapor. The moisture in  the air is called the humidity of the air. Moisture does not  consist of tiny particles of liquid held in suspension in the air  as in the case of fog, but is an invisible vapor truly as gaseous  as the air with which it mixes. Fog and humidity both affect  the performance of an aircraft. In flight, at cruising power,  the effects are small and receive no consideration. During  takeoff, however, humidity has important effects. Two things  are done to compensate for the effects of humidity on takeoff  performance. Since humid air is less dense than dry air, the  allowable takeoff gross weight of an aircraft is generally  reduced for operation in areas that are consistently humid.  

Second, because the power output of reciprocating engines  is decreased by humidity, the manifold pressure may need  to be increased above that recommended for takeoff in dry  air in order to obtain the same power output.  

Engine power output is calculated on dry air. Since water  vapor is incombustible, its pressure in the atmosphere is a  total loss as far as contributing to power output. The mixture  of water vapor and air is drawn through the carburetor, and  fuel is metered into it as though it were all air. This mixture  of water vapor, air, and fuel enters the combustion chamber  where it is ignited. Since the water vapor will not burn, the  effective air-fuel ratio is enriched and the engine operates as  though it were on an excessively rich mixture. The resulting  horsepower loss under humid conditions can therefore be  attributed to the loss in volumetric efficiency due to displaced  air, and the incomplete combustion due to an excessively rich  fuel and air mixture.  

The reduction in power that can be expected from humidity  is usually given in charts in the flight manual. There are  several types of charts in use. Some merely show the expected  reduction in power due to humidity; others show the boost  in manifold pressure necessary to restore full takeoff power.  

The effect of fog on the performance of an engine is very  noticeable, particularly on engines with high compression  ratios. Normally, some detonation will occur during  acceleration, due to the high BMEP, which stands for brake  mean effective pressures, developed. However, on a foggy  

![](images/0f45274660396bd1a4c742fffa05d82f21877482c4f7622018e3c6bdb5178b22.jpg)

Figure 5-51.   An airplane’s altimeter is an aneroid barometer.  

day it is difficult to cause detonation to occur. The explanation  of this lies in the fact that fog consists of particles of water  that have not vaporized. When these particles enter the  cylinders, they absorb a tremendous amount of heat energy  in the process of vaporizing. The temperature is thus lowered,  and the decrease is sufficient to prevent detonation.  

Fog will generally cause a decrease in horsepower output.  However, with a supercharged engine, it will be possible to  use higher manifold pressures without danger of detonation.  

# Absolute Humidity  

Absolute humidity is the actual amount of the water vapor  in a mixture of air and water. It is expressed either in grams  per cubic meter or pounds per cubic foot. The amount of  water vapor that can be present in the air is dependent upon  the temperature and pressure. The higher the temperatures,  the more water vapor the air is capable of holding, assuming  constant pressure. When air has all the water vapor it can  hold at the prevailing temperature and pressure, it is said to  be saturated.  

# Relative Humidity  

Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor  actually present in the atmosphere to the amount that  would be present if the air were saturated at the prevailing  temperature and pressure. This ratio is usually multiplied by  100 and expressed as a percentage. Suppose, for example, that  a weather report includes the information that the temperature  is  $75\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and the relative humidity is 56 percent. This indicates  that the air holds 56 percent of the water vapor required to  

![](images/1573e3ce8cba7e88552aab51aa6baf92d5520e30a87a6fda7eb93b446d0539c6.jpg)

saturate it at  $75\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . If the temperature drops and the absolute  humidity remain constant, the relative humidity will increase.  This is because less water vapor is required to saturate the  air at the lower temperature.  

# Dew Point  

The dew point is the temperature to which humid air must  be cooled at constant pressure to become saturated. If the  temperature drops below the dew point, condensation occurs.  People who wear eyeglasses have experience going from cold  outside air into a warm room and having moisture collect  quickly on their glasses. This happens because the glasses  were below the dew point temperature of the air in the room.  The air immediately in contact with the glasses was cooled  below its dew point temperature, and some of the water vapor  was condensed out. This principle is applied in determining  the dew point. A vessel is cooled until water vapor begins  to condense on its surface. The temperature at which this  occurs is the dew point.  

# Vapor Pressure  

Vapor pressure is the portion of atmospheric pressure that  is exerted by the moisture in the air, which is expressed in  tenths of an inch of mercury. The dew point for a given  condition depends on the amount of water pressure present;  thus, a direct relationship exists between the vapor pressure  and the dew point.  

# Standard Atmosphere  

If the performance of an aircraft is computed, either through  flight tests or wind tunnel tests, some standard reference  condition must be determined first in order to compare results  with those of similar tests. The conditions in the atmosphere  vary continuously, and it is generally not possible to obtain  exactly the same set of conditions on two different days or  even on two successive flights. For this reason, a set group  of standards must be used as a point of reference. The set  of standard conditions presently used in the United States is  known as the U.S. Standard Atmosphere.  

The standard atmosphere approximates the average conditions  existing at  $40^{\circ}$   latitude, and is determined on the basis of the  following assumptions. The standard sea level conditions are:  

Pressure at 0 altitude   $\mathrm{(P0)}=29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  Temperature at 0 altitude   $(\mathrm{T}0)=15\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Gravity at 0 altitude   $(\mathrm{G}0)=32.174~\mathrm{fps}/\mathrm{s}$  s  

The U.S. Standard Atmosphere is in agreement with the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard  Atmosphere over their common altitude range. The ICAO  Standard Atmosphere has been adopted as standard by most  of the principal nations of the world.  

# Aircraft Theory of Flight  

Before a technician can consider performing maintenance  on an aircraft, it is necessary to understand the pieces that  make up the aircraft. Names like fuselage, empennage, wing,  and so many others, come into play when describing what  an airplane is and how it operates. For helicopters, names  like main rotor, anti-torque rotor, and autorotation come  to mind as a small portion of what needs to be understood  about rotorcraft. The study of physics, which includes basic  aerodynamics, is a necessary part of understanding why  aircraft operate the way they do.  

# Four Forces of Flight  

During flight, there are four forces acting on an airplane.  These forces are lift, weight, thrust, and drag.  [Figure 5-53 ]  Lift is the upward force created by the wing, weight is the  pull of gravity on the mass, thrust is the force created by the  airplane’s propeller or turbine engine, and drag is the friction  caused by the air flowing around the airplane.  

All four of these forces are measured in pounds. Any time  the forces are not in balance, something about the airplane’s  condition is changing. The possibilities are as follows:  

1.	 When an airplane is accelerating, it has more thrust  than drag.  2.	 When an airplane is decelerating, it has less thrust  than drag.  3.	 When an airplane is at a constant velocity, thrust and  drag are equal.  

4.	 When an airplane is climbing, it has more lift than  weight.  5.	 When an airplane is descending, it has more weight  than lift.  6.	 When an airplane is at a constant altitude, lift and  weight are equal.  

# Bernoulli’s Principle and Subsonic Flow  

The basic concept of subsonic airflow and the resulting  pressure differentials was discovered by Daniel Bernoulli,  a Swiss physicist. Bernoulli’s principle, as we refer to it  today, states that “as the velocity of a fluid increases, the  static pressure of that fluid will decrease, provided there is  no energy added or energy taken away.” A direct application  of Bernoulli’s principle is the study of air as it flows through  either a converging or a diverging passage, and to relate the  findings to some aviation concepts.  

A converging shape is one whose cross-sectional area gets  progressively smaller from entry to exit. A diverging shape is  just the opposite, with the cross-sectional area getting larger  from entry to exit.  Figure 5-54  shows a converging shaped  duct, with the air entering on the left at subsonic velocity and  exiting on the right. Notice that the air exits at an increased  velocity and a decreased static pressure when looking at  the pressure and velocity gauges, and the indicated velocity  and pressure. The unit leaving must increase its velocity as  it flows into a smaller space, because a unit of air must exit  the duct when another unit enters.  

In a diverging duct, just the opposite would happen. From  the entry point to the exit point, the duct is spreading out and  the area is getting larger.  [Figure 5-55]  With the increase  in cross-sectional area, the velocity of the air decreases  and the static pressure increases. The total energy in the  air has not changed. What has been lost in velocity, which  is kinetic energy, is gained in static pressure, which is  potential energy.  

In the discussion of Bernoulli’s principle earlier in this  chapter, a venturi was shown in  Figure 5-46 . In  Figure 5-56 , a  venturi is shown again, only this time a wing is shown tucked  up into the recess where the venturi’s converging shape is.  There are two arrows showing airflow. The large arrow shows  airflow within the venturi, and the small arrow shows airflow  on the outside heading toward the leading edge of the wing.  

In the converging part of the venturi, velocity would increase  and static pressure would decrease. The same thing would  happen to the air flowing around the wing, with the velocity  over the top increasing and static pressure decreasing.  

In  Figure 5-56 , the air reaching the leading edge of the wing  separates into two separate flows. Some of the air goes over  the top of the wing and some travels along the bottom. The  air going over the top, because of the curvature, has farther  to travel. With a greater distance to travel, the air going over  the top must move at a greater velocity. The higher velocity  on the top causes the static pressure on the top to be less than  it is on the bottom, and this difference in static pressures is  what creates lift.  

For the wing shown in  Figure 5-56 , imagine it is 5 ft. wide  and 15 ft. long, for a surface area of 75 ft 2    $(10{,}800\ \mathrm{in}^{2})$  ). If  the difference in static pressure between the top and bottom  is 0.1 psi, there will be   $\%$   lb of lift for each square inch of  surface area. Since there are  $10{,}800\,\mathrm{in}^{2}$   of surface area, there  would be 1,080 lb of lift   $(0.1\times10{,}800)$  .  

# Lift and Newton’s Third Law  

Newton’s third law identifies that for every force there is an  equal and opposite reacting force. In addition to Bernoulli’s  principle, Newton’s third law can also be used to explain the lift  being created by a wing. As the air travels around a wing and  leaves the trailing edge, the air is forced to move in a downward  direction. Since a force is required to make something change  direction, there must be an equal and opposite reacting force.  In this case, the reacting force is what we call lift. In order to  calculate lift based on Newton’s third law,  

Newton’s second law and the formula “Force  $={\mathrm{Mass}}\ \times$    Acceleration” would be used. The mass would be the  weight of air flowing over the wing every second, and  the acceleration would be the change in velocity the wing  imparts to the air.  

The lift on the wing as described by Bernoulli’s principle,  and lift on the wing as described by Newton’s third law, is  

![](images/927b01284dd6242d44793f9643dcb1b2138ed8070d73a58465eca248c8e42a3d.jpg)  
Figure 5-53.   Four forces acting on an airplane.  

not separate or independent of each other. They are just two  different ways to describe the same thing, namely the lift  on a wing.  

# Airfoils  

An airfoil is any device that creates a force, based on  Bernoulli’s principles or Newton’s laws, when air is caused  to flow over the surface of the device. An airfoil can be the  wing of an airplane, the blade of a propeller, the rotor blade of  a helicopter, or the fan blade of a turbofan engine. The wing  of an airplane moves through the air because the airplane  is in motion, and generates lift by the process previously  described. By comparison, a propeller blade, helicopter rotor  blade, or turbofan engine fan blade rotates through the air.  These rotating blades could be referred to as rotating wings,  as is common with helicopters when they are called rotary  wing aircraft. The rotating wing can be viewed as a device  that creates lift, or just as correctly, it can be viewed as a  device that creates thrust.  

In  Figure 5-57  an airfoil, or wing, is shown, with some of  the terminology that is used to describe a wing. The terms  and their meaning are as follows:  

# Camber  

The camber of a wing is the curvature which is present on top  and bottom surfaces. The camber on the top is much more  pronounced, unless the wing is a symmetrical airfoil, which has  the same camber top and bottom. The bottom of the wing, more  often than not, is relatively flat. The increased camber on top  

![](images/9d7551fc85e098c744972827a26523b9cbaa65c620e4894141eecff399157b68.jpg)

Figure 5-55.   Bernoulli’s principle and a diverging duct.  

is what causes the velocity of the air to increase and the static  pressure to decrease. The bottom of the wing has less velocity  and more static pressure, which is why the wing generates lift.  

# Chord Line  

The chord line is an imaginary straight line running from the  wing’s leading edge to its trailing edge. The angle between  the chord line and the longitudinal axis of the airplane is  known as the angle of incidence.  

# Relative Wind  

The relative wind is a relationship between the direction of  airflow and the aircraft wing. In normal flight circumstances, the  relative wind is the opposite direction of the aircraft flightpath.  

•	 If the flightpath is forward then the relative wind is backward. •	 If the flightpath is forward and upward, then the relative wind is backward and downward. •	 If the flightpath is forward and downward, then the relative wind is backward and upward.  

Therefore, the relative wind is parallel to the flightpath, and  travels in the opposite direction.  

# Angle of  Attack  

The angle between the chord line and the relative wind is  the angle of attack. As the angle of attack increases, the lift  on the wing increases. If the angle of attack becomes too  great, the airflow can separate from the wing and the lift  

![](images/d92645f1e9aea4de0803a300229b19e02603d9516403fc8459d1261d2d81fdc5.jpg)  
Figure 5-56.   Venturi with a superimposed wing.  

will be destroyed. When this occurs, a condition known as  a stall takes place.  

There are a number of different shapes, known as planforms  that a wing can have. A wing in the shape of a rectangle is  very common on small general aviation airplanes. An elliptical  shape or tapered wing can also be used, but these do not have  as desirable a stall characteristic. For airplanes that operate at  high subsonic speeds, sweptback wings are common, and for  supersonic flight, a delta shape might be used.  

The aspect ratio of a wing is the relationship between its  span, or a wingtip to wingtip measurement, and the chord of  the wing. If a wing has a long span and a very narrow chord,  it is said to have a high aspect ratio. A higher aspect ratio  produces less drag for a given flight speed, and is typically  found on glider type aircraft.  

The angle of incidence of a wing is the angle formed by the  intersection of the wing chord line and the horizontal plane  passing through the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. Many  airplanes are designed with a greater angle of incidence at  the root of the wing than at the tip, and this is referred to as  washout. This feature causes the inboard part of the wing to  stall before the outboard part, which helps maintain aileron  control during the initial stages of a wing stall.  

# Boundary Layer Airflow  

The boundary layer is a very thin layer of air lying over the  surface of the wing and, for that matter, all other surfaces of  the airplane. Because air has viscosity, this layer of air tends  to adhere to the wing. As the wing moves forward through  the air the boundary layer at first flows smoothly over the  streamlined shape of the airfoil. Here the flow is called the  laminar layer.  

As the boundary layer approaches the center of the wing,  it begins to lose speed due to skin friction and it becomes  thicker and turbulent. Here it is called the turbulent layer. The  point at which the boundary layer changes from laminar to  turbulent is called the transition point. Where the boundary  

![](images/d86f0a4db30d87e2c190d8cb678f59d6ea348da5de01f0c5b390df3315fa1f17.jpg)  
Figure 5-57.   Wing terminology.  

layer becomes turbulent, drag due to skin friction is  relatively high. As speed increases, the transition point  tends to move forward. As the angle of attack increases, the  transition point also tends to move forward. With higher  angles of attack and further thickening of the boundary layer,  the turbulence becomes so great the air breaks away from  the surface of the wing. At this point, the lift of the wing is  destroyed and a condition known as a stall has occurred.  In  Figure 5-58 , view A shows a normal angle of attack and  the airflow staying in contact with the wing. View B shows  an extreme angle of attack and the airflow separating and  becoming turbulent on the top of the wing. In view B, the  wing is in a stall.  

# Boundary Layer Control  

One way of keeping the boundary layer air under control, or  lessening its negative effect, is to make the wing’s surface  as smooth as possible and to keep it free of dirt and debris.  As the friction between the air and the surface of the wing  increases, the boundary layer thickens and becomes more  turbulent and eventually a wing stall occurs. With a smooth  and clean wing surface, the onset of a stall is delayed and  the wing can operate at a higher angle of attack. One of the  reasons ice forming on a wing can be such a serious problem  is because of its effect on boundary layer air. On a high-speed  airplane, even a few bugs splattered on the wing’s leading  edge can negatively affect boundary layer air.  

Other methods of controlling boundary layer air include wing  leading edge slots, air suction through small holes on the wing’s  upper surface, and the use of devices called vortex generators.  

A wing leading edge slot is a duct that allows air to flow from  the bottom of the wing, through the duct, to the top of the  wing. As the air flows to the top of the wing, it is directed  along the wing’s surface at a high velocity and helps keep  the boundary layer from becoming turbulent and separating  from the wing’s surface.  

Another way of controlling boundary layer air is to create  suction on the top of the wing through a large number of  small holes. The suction on the top of the wing draws away  the slow-moving turbulent air, and helps keep the remainder  of the airflow in contact with the wing.  

Vortex generators are used on airplanes that fly at high  subsonic speed, where the velocity of the air on the top of the  wing can reach Mach 1. As the air reaches Mach 1 velocity, a  shock wave forms on the top of the wing, and the subsequent  shock wave causes the air to separate from the wing’s upper  surface. Vortex generators are short airfoils, arranged in pairs,  located on the wing’s upper surface. They are positioned such  that they pull high-energy air down into the boundary layer  region and prevent airflow separation.  

# Wingtip Vortices  

Wingtip vortices are caused by the air beneath the wing,  which is at the higher pressure, flowing over the wingtip  and up toward the top of the wing. The end result is a  spiral or vortex that trails behind the wingtip anytime lift  is being produced. This vortex is also referred to as wake  turbulence, and is a significant factor in determining how  closely one airplane can follow behind another on approach  to land. The wake turbulence of a large airplane can cause  a smaller airplane, if it is following too closely, to be  thrown out of control. Vortices from the wing and from the  horizontal stabilizer are quite visible on the MD-11 shown  in  Figure 5-59.  

Upwash and downwash refer to the effect an airfoil has on  the free airstream. Upwash is the deflection of the oncoming  airstream, causing it to flow up and over the wing. Downwash  is the downward deflection of the airstream after it has passed  over the wing and is leaving the trailing edge. This downward  deflection is what creates the action and reaction described  under lift and Newton’s third law.  

# Axes of an Aircraft  

An airplane in flight is controlled around one or more of three  axes of rotation. These axes of rotation are the longitudinal,  lateral, and vertical. On the airplane, all three axes intersect  at the center of gravity. As the airplane pivots on one of these  axes, it is in essence pivoting around the center of gravity (CG).  

![](images/3702482ef20e8388b476c7f51a80f09eb63e113e5e5c9ed779fea92bbedd3965.jpg)  
Figure 5-58.   Wing boundary layer separation.  

The center of gravity is also referred to as the center of rotation.  

On the brightly colored airplane shown in  Figure 5-60 , the  three axes are shown in the colors red (vertical axis), blue  (longitudinal axis), and orange (lateral axis). The flight  control that makes the airplane move around the axis is shown  in a matching color.  

The rudder, in red, causes the airplane to move around the  vertical axis and this movement is described as being a yaw.  The elevator, in orange, causes the airplane to move around  the lateral axis and this movement is described as being  a pitch. The ailerons, in blue, cause the airplane to move  around the longitudinal axis and this movement is described  as being a roll.  

# Aircraft Stability  

When an airplane is in straight-and-level flight at a constant  velocity, all the forces acting on the airplane are in equilibrium.  If that straight-and-level flight is disrupted by a disturbance in  the air, such as wake turbulence, the airplane might pitch up  or down, yaw left or right, or go into a roll. If the airplane has  what is characterized as stability, once the disturbance goes  away, the airplane will return to a state of equilibrium.  

# Static Stability  

The initial response that an airplane displays after its  equilibrium is disrupted is referred to as its static stability. If  the static stability is positive, the airplane will tend to return  to its original position after the disruptive force is removed.  If the static stability is negative, the airplane will continue to  move away from its original position after the disruptive force  is removed. If an airplane with negative static stability has  the nose pitch up because of wake turbulence, the tendency  will be for the nose to continue to pitch up even after the  turbulence goes away. If an airplane tends to remain in a  displaced position after the force is removed, but does not  continue to move toward even greater displacement, its static  stability is described as being neutral.  

# Dynamic Stability  

The dynamic stability of an airplane involves the amount of  time it takes for it to react to its static stability after it has  been displaced from a condition of equilibrium. Dynamic  stability involves the oscillations that typically occur as the  airplane tries to return to its original position or attitude. Even  though an airplane may have positive static stability, it may  have dynamic stability which is positive, neutral, or negative.  

Imagine that an airplane in straight-and-level flight is  disturbed and pitches noseup. If the airplane has positive  static stability, the nose will pitch back down after the  disturbance is removed. If it immediately returns to straight-  

![](images/3e7b0f78908687ee4251a6aafd13ed8ade4911f3f986f6a9be1b8bc059d057cc.jpg)  
Figure 5-59.   Wing and horizontal stabilizer vortices on an MD-11.  

and-level flight, it is also said to have positive dynamic  stability. The airplane, however, may pass through level flight  and remain pitched down, and then continue the recovery  process by pitching back up. This pitching up and then  down is known as an oscillation. If the oscillations lessen  over time, the airplane is still classified as having positive  dynamic stability. If the oscillations increase over time, the  airplane is classified as having negative dynamic stability.  If the oscillations remain the same over time, the airplane is  classified as having neutral dynamic stability.  

Figure 5-61  shows the concept of dynamic stability. In view  A, the displacement from equilibrium goes through three  oscillations and then returns to equilibrium. In view B,  the displacement from equilibrium is increasing after two  oscillations, and will not return to equilibrium. In view C,  the displacement from equilibrium is staying the same with  each oscillation.  

# Longitudinal Stability  

Longitudinal stability for an airplane involves the tendency  for the nose to pitch up or pitch down, rotating around the  lateral axis, which is measured from wingtip to wingtip. If an  airplane is longitudinally stable, it will return to a properly  trimmed angle of attack after the force that upset its flightpath  is removed.  

The weight and balance of an airplane, which is based on  both the design characteristics of the airplane and the way  it is loaded, is a major factor in determining longitudinal  stability. There is a point on the wing of an airplane, called  the center of pressure or center of lift, where all the lifting  forces concentrate. In flight, the airplane acts like it is being  lifted from or supported by this point. This center of lift  runs from wingtip to wingtip. There is also a point on the  airplane, called the center of gravity, where the mass or  weight of the airplane is concentrated. For an airplane to have  good longitudinal stability, the center of gravity is typically  located forward of the center of lift. This gives the airplane  a nosedown pitching tendency, which is balanced out by the  force generated at the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. The  center of gravity has limits within which it must fall. If it is  too far forward, the forces at the tail might not be able to  compensate and it may not be possible to keep the nose of  the airplane from pitching down.  

In  Figure 5-62 , the center of lift, center of gravity, and center  of gravity limits are shown. It can be seen that the center  of gravity is not only forward of the center of lift, it is also  forward of the center of gravity limit. At the back of the  airplane, the elevator trailing edge is deflected upward to  create a downward force on the tail, to try and keep the nose  

![](images/98362c714fa314334707b33e1faa93d5bd864e14bc8e3e3e9318d300aebf6968.jpg)  
Figure 5-60.   The three axes intersect at the airplane’s center of gravity. The flight control that produces motion around the indicated  axis is a  matching color.  

of the airplane up. This airplane would be highly unstable  longitudinally, especially at low speed when trying to land.  It is especially dangerous if the center of gravity is behind  the aft limit. The airplane will now have a tendency to pitch  noseup, which can lead to the wing stalling and possible loss  of control of the airplane.  

# Lateral Stability  

Lateral stability of an airplane takes place around the  longitudinal axis, which is from the airplane’s nose to its  tail. If one wing is lower than the other, good lateral stability  will tend to bring the wings back to a level flight attitude.  One design characteristic that tends to give an airplane good  lateral stability is called dihedral. Dihedral is an upward  wing angle, with respect to the horizontal, and it is usually  just a few degrees.  

Imagine a low wing airplane with a few degrees of dihedral  experiencing a disruption of its flightpath such that the left  wing drops. When the left wing drops, this will cause the  airplane to experience a sideslip toward the low wing. The  sideslip causes the low wing to experience a higher angle  of attack, which increases its lift and raises it back to a level  flight attitude. The dihedral on a wing is shown in  Figure 5-63.  

# Directional Stability  

Movement of the airplane around its vertical axis, and the  airplane’s ability to not be adversely affected by a force creating  a yaw type of motion, is called directional stability. The vertical  fin gives the airplane this stability, causing the airplane to  align with the relative wind. In flight, the airplane acts like the  weather vane we use around our home to show the direction  the wind is blowing. The distance from the pivot point on a  weather vane to its tail is greater than the distance from its  pivot point to the nose. So, when the wind blows, it creates a  greater torque force on the tail and forces it to align with the  wind. On an airplane, the same is true. With the CG being the  pivot point, it is a greater distance from the CG to the vertical  stabilizer than it is from the CG to the nose.  [Figure 5-64]  

![](images/69d132103660b86dc48a8bcdb0162b24ea5499e072827f41bb147b9725b8b6e1.jpg)  
Figure 5-61.   Dynamic stability.  

# Dutch Roll  

The dihedral of the wing tries to roll the airplane in the opposite  direction of how it is slipping, and the vertical fin will try to  yaw the airplane in the direction of the slip. These two events  combine in a way that affects lateral and directional stability. If  the wing dihedral has the greatest effect, the airplane will have  a tendency to experience a Dutch roll. A Dutch roll is a small  amount of oscillation around both the longitudinal and vertical  axes. Although this condition is not considered dangerous,  it can produce an uncomfortable feeling for passengers.  Commercial airliners typically have yaw dampers that sense  a Dutch roll condition and cancel it out.  

# Flight Control Surfaces  

The purpose of flight controls is to allow the pilot to maneuver  the airplane, and to control it from the time it starts the takeoff  roll until it lands and safely comes to a halt. Flight controls  are typically associated with the wing and the vertical and  horizontal stabilizers, because these are the parts of the airplane  that flight controls most often attach to. In flight, and to some  extent on the ground, flight controls provide the airplane with  the ability to move around one or more of the three axes.  Flight controls function by changing the shape or aerodynamic  characteristics of the surface they are attached to.  

# Flight Controls & the Lateral Axis  

The lateral axis of an airplane is a line that runs below  the wing, from wingtip to wingtip, passing through the  airplane’s center of gravity. Movement around this axis  is called pitch, and control around this axis is called  longitudinal control. The flight control that handles this  job is the elevator attached to the horizontal stabilizer, a  fully moving horizontal stabilizer, or on a v-tail configured  airplane, it is called ruddervators. An elevator on a Cessna  182 can be seen in  Figure 5-65 . In  Figure 5-66 , a fully  moving horizontal stabilizer, known as a stabilator, can  be seen on a Piper Cherokee Cruiser PA-28-140, and  Figure 5-67  shows a ruddervator on a Beechcraft Bonanza. Depending on the airplane being discussed, movement around  the lateral axis happens as a result of the pilot moving the  

![](images/486d2085013dae5b0f2c696243042afb36e9ad116a213ba3fc2c42fe43c3d740.jpg)

control wheel or yoke, the control stick, or on some airplanes,  a side stick. On the airplanes shown in  Figures 5-70  and  5-71 ,  a control wheel or yoke is used.  

On the Cessna 182 shown in  Figure 5-65 , pulling back on  the control wheel causes the trailing edge of the elevator to  deflect upward, causing an increased downward force that  raises the nose of the airplane. Movement of the elevator  causes the nose of the airplane to pitch up or pitch down by  rotating around the lateral axis. The Cessna 182 control wheel  can be seen in  Figure 5-68.  

On the Piper Cherokee Cruiser PA-28-140 shown in  Figure 5-66 , pulling back on the control wheel causes the  entire horizontal surface, or stabilator, to move, with the  trailing edge deflecting upward. The anti-servo tab seen on  the Cherokee provides a control feel similar to what would  be experienced by moving an elevator. Without this tab,  the stabilator might be too easy to move and a pilot could  overcontrol the airplane.  

The ruddervators shown on the Beechcraft Bonanza in  Figure 5-67  are also moved by the control wheel, with their  trailing edges deflecting upward when the control wheel is  pulled back. As the name implies, these surfaces also act as  the rudder for this airplane.  

# Flight Controls and the Longitudinal Axis  

The longitudinal axis of the airplane runs through the  middle of the airplane, from nose to tail, passing through  the center of gravity. Movement around this axis is known  as roll, and control around this axis is called lateral control.  Movement around this axis is controlled by the ailerons,  and on jet transport airplanes, it is aided by surfaces on the  wing known as spoilers.  

The ailerons move as a result of the pilot rotating the control  wheel to the left or to the right, much the same as turning the  steering wheel on an automobile.  [Figure 5-68]  When a pilot  turns the control wheel to the left, the airplane is being asked  to turn or bank to the left. Turning the control wheel to the  left causes the trailing edge of the aileron on the left wing to

rise up into the airstream, and the aileron on the right wing  lowers down into the airstream. This increases the lift on the  right wing and decreases the lift on the left wing, causing the  right wing to move up and the airplane to bank to the left.  

In  Figure 5-69 , an aircraft can be seen doing an aileron roll.  Notice that the left aileron is up and the right aileron is down,  which would cause the airplane to roll around the longitudinal  axis in a counterclockwise direction.  

# Flight Controls and the Vertical Axis  

The vertical axis of an airplane runs from top to bottom  through the middle of the airplane, passing through the center  of gravity. Movement around this axis is known as yaw, and  control around this axis is called directional control. Movement  around this axis is controlled by the rudder, or in the case of  the Beechcraft Bonanza in  Figure 5-67 , by the ruddervators.  

The feet of the pilot are on the rudder pedals, and pushing  on the left or right rudder pedal makes the rudder move left  or right. The trailing edge of the rudder moves to the right,  and the nose of the airplane yaws to the right, when the right  rudder pedal is pushed. The rudder pedals of a Cessna 182  can be seen in  Figure 5-68 .  

Even though the rudder of the airplane will make the nose  yaw to the left or the right, the rudder is not what turns the

airplane. For what is called a coordinated turn to occur, both  the ailerons and rudder come into play. Let’s say we want to  turn the airplane to the right. We start by turning the control  wheel to the right, which raises the right aileron and lowers  the left aileron and initiates the banking turn. The increased  lift on the left wing also increases the induced drag on the left  wing, which tries to make the nose of the airplane yaw to the  left. To counteract this, when the control wheel is moved to  the right, a small amount of right rudder is used to keep the  nose of the airplane from yawing to the left. Once the nose of  the airplane is pointing in the right direction, pressure on the  rudder is no longer needed. The rudder of a Piper Cherokee  Arrow can be seen in  Figure 5-70.  

# Tabs  

Trim Tabs  

Trim tabs are small movable surfaces that attach to the trailing  edge of flight controls. These tabs can be controlled from the  flight deck, and their purpose is to create an aerodynamic  force that keeps the flight control in a deflected position. Trim  

![](images/5596dddb0e62a236d7a6f268130e397e8c24afdd3ed68bafe5a6639f5887f53b.jpg)

Figure 5-68.   Cessna 182 control wheel and rudder pedals.  

tabs can be installed on any of the primary flight controls.  

A very common flight control to find fitted with a trim tab  is the elevator. In order to be stable in flight, most airplanes  have the center of gravity located forward of the center of lift  on the wing. This causes a nose heavy condition, which needs  to be balanced out by having the elevator deflect upwards  and create a downward force. To relieve the pilot of the need  to hold back pressure on the control wheel, a trim tab on the  elevator can be adjusted to hold the elevator in a slightly  deflected position. An elevator trim tab for a Cessna 182 is  shown in  Figure 5-71.  

# Anti-servo Tab  

Some airplanes, like a Piper Cherokee Arrow, do not have  a fixed horizontal stabilizer and movable elevator. The  Cherokee uses a moving horizontal surface known as a  stabilator. Because of the location of the pivot point for this  movable surface, it has a tendency to be extremely sensitive  to pilot input. To reduce the sensitivity, a full length anti-servo  tab is installed on the trailing edge of the stabilator. As the  trailing edge of the stabilator moves down, the anti-servo tab  moves down and creates a force trying to raise the trailing  edge. With this force acting against the movement of the  stabilator, it reduces the sensitivity to pilot input. The anti- servo tab on a Piper Cherokee Arrow is shown in  Figure 5-70. Balance Tab  

On some airplanes, the force needed to move the flight  controls can be excessive. In these cases, a balance tab can  be used to generate a force that assists in the movement of the  flight control. Just the opposite of anti-servo tabs, balance tabs  move in the opposite direction of the flight control’s trailing  edge, providing a force that helps the flight control move.  

# Servo Tab  

On large airplanes, because the force needed to move the  flight controls is beyond the capability of the pilot, hydraulic  actuators are used to provide the necessary force. In the event  

![](images/c7a048bcc0a1aadb2d4fcadac8315402f5d3f70d449cb8038339d06651f5766c.jpg)  
Figure 5-69.   Aircraft performing an aileron roll.  

of a hydraulic system malfunction or failure, some of these  airplanes have servo tabs on the trailing edge of the primary  flight controls. When the control wheel is pulled back in an  attempt to move the elevator, the servo tab moves and creates  enough aerodynamic force to move the elevator. The servo tab  is acting like a balance tab, but rather than assisting the normal  force that moves the elevator, it becomes the sole force that  makes the elevator move. Like the balance tab, the servo tab  moves in the opposite direction of the flight control’s trailing  edge. The Boeing 727 has servo tabs that back up the hydraulic  system in the event of a failure. During normal flight, the servo  tabs act like balance tabs.  [Figure 5-72]  

# Supplemental Lift-Modifying Devices  

If the wing of an airplane was designed to produce the  maximum lift possible at low airspeed, to accommodate  takeoffs and landings, it would not be suited for higher speed  flight because of the enormous amount of drag it would  produce. To give the wing the ability to produce maximum  low speed lift without being drag prohibitive, retractable high  lift devices, such as flaps and slats, are utilized.  

# Flaps  

The most often used lift-modifying device, for small  airplanes and large, is the wing flap. Flaps can be installed  on the leading edge or trailing edge, with the leading edge  versions used only on larger airplanes. Flaps change the  camber of the wing, and they increase both the lift and  the drag for any given angle of attack. The four different  types of flaps in use are called the plain, split, slotted, and  Fowler.  [Figure 5-73]  

Plain flaps attach to the trailing edge of the wing, inboard  of the ailerons, and form part of the wing’s overall surface.  When deployed downward, they increase the effective  camber of the wing and the wing’s chord line. Both of these  

![](images/c636f5a45ef41d673319280d3492ac3447ac1d097bc34de0a5eb6bc2e2dac7a5.jpg)  
Figure 5-70.   Rudder and anti-servo tab on a Piper Cherokee Arrow.  

factors cause the wing to create more lift and more drag. The split flap attaches to the bottom of the wing, and deploys  downward without changing the top surface of the wing. This  type of flap creates more drag than the plain flap because of  the increase in turbulence.  

The slotted flap is similar to the plain flap, except when it  deploys, the leading edge drops down a small amount. By  having the leading edge drop down slightly, a slot opens,  which lets some of the high-pressure air on the bottom of the  wing flow over the top of the flap. This additional airflow  over the top of the flap produces additional lift.  

The Fowler flap attaches to the back of the wing using a track  and roller system. When it deploys, it moves aft in addition  to deflecting downward. This increases the total wing area,  in addition to increasing the wing camber and chord line.  This type of flap is the most effective of the four types, and  it is the type used on commercial airliners and business jets.  

# Leading Edge Slots  

Leading edge slots are ducts or passages in the leading edge  of a wing that allow high pressure air from the bottom of the  wing to flow to the top of the wing. This ducted air flows  over the top of the wing at a high velocity and helps keep the  boundary layer air from becoming turbulent and separating  

![](images/0535c6698a1831d3854d34a12fddef8785d5570f6fc664a5304504753e8e1aaa.jpg)  
Figure 5-71.   Elevator trim tab on a Cessna 182.  

from the wing. Slots are often placed on the part of the wing  ahead of the ailerons, so during a wing stall, the inboard  part of the wing stalls first and the ailerons remain effective.  

# Leading Edge Slats  

Leading edge slats serve the same purpose as slots, the  difference being that slats are movable and can be retracted  when not needed. On some airplanes, leading edge slats have  been automatic in operation, deploying in response to the  aerodynamic forces that come into play during a high angle of  attack. On most of today’s commercial airliners, the leading  edge slats deploy when the trailing edge flaps are lowered.  

The flight controls of a large commercial airliner are shown  in  Figure 5-72 . The controls by color are as follows:  

1.	 All aerodynamic tabs are shown in green. 2.	 All leading and trailing edge high lift devices are  shown in red (leading edge flaps and slats, trailing  edge inboard and outboard flaps). 3.	 The tail mounted primary flight controls are in orange  (rudder and elevator). 4.	 The wing mounted primary flight controls are in purple  (inboard and outboard aileron).  

# High-Speed Aerodynamics Compressibility Effects  

When air is flowing at subsonic speed, it acts like an  incompressible fluid. As discussed earlier in this chapter,  when air at subsonic speed flows through a diverging shaped  passage, the velocity decreases and the static pressure rises,  but the density of the air does not change. In a converging  shaped passage, subsonic air speeds up and its static pressure  decreases. When supersonic air flows through a converging  passage, its velocity decreases and its pressure and density  both increase.  [Figure 5-74]  At supersonic flow, air acts like  a compressible fluid. Because air behaves differently when  flowing at supersonic velocity, airplanes that fly supersonic  must have wings with a different shape.  

# The Speed of Sound  

Sound, in reference to airplanes and their movement through  the air, is nothing more than pressure disturbances in the  air. As discussed earlier in this chapter, it is like dropping a  rock in the water and watching the waves flow out from the  center. As an airplane flies through the air, every point on  the airplane that causes a disturbance creates sound energy  in the form of pressure waves. These pressure waves flow  away from the airplane at the speed of sound, which at  standard day temperature of  $59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , is   $761~\mathrm{mph}$  . The speed  

![](images/6151d4a28cf6c4e0a9c44b71c80e2cd27482656208dcd66e83a97ce3da3cdedc.jpg)

Figure 5-73.   Four types of wing flaps.  

of sound in air changes with temperature, increasing as  temperature increases.  Figure 5-75  shows how the speed  of sound changes with altitude.  

# Subsonic, Transonic, and Supersonic Flight  

When an airplane is flying at subsonic speed, all of the air  flowing around the airplane is at a velocity of less than the  speed of sound, which is known as Mach 1. Keep in mind  that the air accelerates when it flows over certain parts of  the airplane, like the top of the wing, so an airplane flying  at   $500~\mathrm{mph}$   could have air over the top of the wing reach  a speed of   $600\;\mathrm{mph}$  . How fast an airplane can fly and still  be considered in subsonic flight varies with the design of  the wing, but as a Mach number, it will typically be just  over Mach 0.8.  

When an airplane is flying at transonic speed, part of  the airplane is experiencing subsonic airflow and part is  experiencing supersonic airflow. Over the top of the wing,  probably about halfway back, the velocity of the air will  reach Mach 1 and a shock wave will form. The shock wave  forms 90 degrees to the airflow and is known as a normal  shock wave. Stability problems can be encountered during  transonic flight, because the shock wave can cause the airflow  to separate from the wing. The shock wave also causes the  center of lift to shift aft, causing the nose to pitch down.  

The speed at which the shock wave forms is known as the  critical Mach number. Transonic speed is typically between  Mach 0.80 and 1.20.  

When an airplane is flying at supersonic speed, the entire  airplane is experiencing supersonic airflow. At this speed, the  shock wave which formed on top of the wing during transonic  flight has moved all the way aft and has attached itself to the  wing trailing edge. Supersonic speed is from Mach 1.20 to  5.0. If an airplane flies faster than Mach 5, it is said to be in  hypersonic flight.  

# Shock Waves  

Sound coming from an airplane is the result of the air  being disturbed as the airplane moves through it, and the  resulting pressure waves that radiate out from the source of  the disturbance. For a slow-moving airplane, the pressure  waves travel out ahead of the airplane, traveling at the speed  of sound. When the speed of the airplane reaches the speed  of sound, however, the pressure waves, or sound energy,  cannot get away from the airplane. At this point the sound  energy starts to pile up, initially on the top of the wing, and  eventually attaching itself to the wing leading and trailing  edges. This piling up of sound energy is called a shock wave.  If the shock waves reach the ground, and cross the path of  a person, they will be heard as a sonic boom.   Figure 5-76A shows a wing in slow speed flight, with many disturbances on  the wing generating sound pressure waves that are radiating  outward. View B is the wing of an airplane in supersonic  flight, with the sound pressure waves piling up toward the  wing leading edge.  

# Normal Shock Wave  

When an airplane is in transonic flight, the shock wave that  forms on top of the wing, and eventually on the bottom of  the wing, is called a normal shock wave. If the leading edge  of the wing is blunted, instead of being rounded or sharp, a  normal shock wave will also form in front of the wing during  

![](images/4cc79f27e884d1f5fda0a0035526f8eb2c008ad6e78b60546c5d88b6a8de9d5d.jpg)  
Figure 5-74.   Supersonic airflow through a venturi.  

supersonic flight. Normal shock waves form perpendicular to  the airstream. The velocity of the air behind a normal shock  wave is subsonic, and the static pressure and density of the air  are higher.  Figure 5-77  shows a normal shock wave forming  on the top of a wing.  

# Oblique Shock Wave  

An airplane that is designed to fly supersonic will have very  sharp edged surfaces, in order to have the least amount of drag.  When the airplane is in supersonic flight, the sharp leading  edge and trailing edge of the wing will have shock waves  attach to them. These shock waves are known as oblique shock  waves. Behind an oblique shock wave the velocity of the air is  lower, but still supersonic, and the static pressure and density  are higher.  Figure 5-78  shows an oblique shock wave on the  leading and trailing edges of a supersonic airfoil.  

# Expansion Wave  

Earlier in the discussion of high-speed aerodynamics, it was  stated that air at supersonic speed acts like a compressible  fluid. For this reason, supersonic air, when given the  opportunity, wants to expand outward. When supersonic  air is flowing over the top of a wing, and the wing surface  turns away from the direction of flow, the air will expand  and follow the new direction. An expansion wave will occur  at the point where the direction of flow changes. Behind the  expansion wave the velocity increases, and the static pressure  and density decrease. An expansion wave is not a shock wave.  Figure 5-78  shows an expansion wave on a supersonic airfoil.  

# High-Speed Airfoils  

Transonic flight is the most difficult flight regime for an  airplane, because part of the wing is experiencing subsonic  airflow and part is experiencing supersonic airflow. For  a subsonic airfoil, the aerodynamic center, or the point of  support, is approximately 25 percent of the way back from  the wing leading edge. In supersonic flight, the aerodynamic  center moves back to 50 percent of the wing’s chord,  causing some significant changes in the airplane’s control  and stability.  

If an airplane designed to fly subsonic, perhaps at a Mach  number of 0.80, flies too fast and enters transonic flight, some  noticeable changes will take place with respect to the airflow  over the wing.  Figure 5-79  shows six views of a wing, with  each view showing the Mach number getting higher.  

The scenario for the six views is as follows:  

A.	 The Mach number is fairly low, and the entire wing is experiencing subsonic airflow. B.	 The velocity has reached the critical Mach number, where the airflow over the top of the wing is reaching  

![Figure 5-75.   Altitude and temperature versus speed of sound. ](images/2d4d2b41954c6fc21340a8e432dfd9451c2a2ab5725923fbc528252245108d4a.jpg)  
\* Altitude at which temperature stops decreasing.  

Mach 1 velocity.  

C.	 The velocity has surpassed the critical Mach number, and a normal shock wave has formed on the top of the  wing. Some airflow separation starts to occur behind the shock wave.  

D.	 The velocity has continued to increase beyond the critical Mach number, and the normal shock wave has  moved far enough aft that serious airflow separation is occurring. A normal shock wave is now forming on the bottom of the wing as well. Behind the normal  

![](images/6fbef4380132a28bce51382e2436056c608ce16289d02cd641b1eb415a197250.jpg)  
Figure 5-76.   Sound energy in subsonic and supersonic flight.  

shock waves, the velocity of the air is subsonic and  the static pressure has increased.  

E.	 The velocity has increased to the point that both shock waves on the wing, top and bottom, have moved to the back of the wing and attached to the trailing edge. Some airflow separation is still occurring. F.	 The forward velocity of the airfoil is greater than Mach 1, and a new shock wave has formed just forward of the leading edge of the wing. If the wing has a sharp leading edge, the shock wave will attach itself to the sharp edge.  

The airfoil shown in  Figure 5-79  is not properly designed  to handle supersonic airflow. The bow wave in front of the  wing leading edge of view F would be attached to the leading  edge, if the wing was a double wedge or biconvex design.  These two wing designs are shown in  Figure 5-80.  

![](images/4bcf17d1474e87b46e39f09829a84d6df91e09b113243e4deca0fb2676a4cfda.jpg)  

# Aerodynamic Heating  

One of the problems with airplanes and high-speed flight is  the heat that builds up on the airplane’s surface because of  air friction. When the SR-71 Blackbird airplane is cruising  at Mach 3.5, skin temperatures on its surface range from   $450\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to over   $1{,}000\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . To withstand this high temperature,  the airplane was constructed of titanium alloy, instead of  the traditional aluminum alloy. The supersonic transport  Concorde was originally designed to cruise at Mach 2.2,  but its cruise speed was reduced to Mach 2.0 because  of structural problems that started to occur because of  aerodynamic heating. If airplanes capable of hypersonic  flight are going to be built in the future, one of the obstacles  that will have to be overcome is the stress on the airplane’s  structure caused by heat.  

# Helicopter Aerodynamics  

The helicopter, as we know it today, falls under the  classification known as rotorcraft. Rotorcraft is also known  as rotary wing aircraft, because instead of their wing being  fixed like it is on an airplane, the wing rotates. The rotating  wing of a rotorcraft can be thought of as a lift producing  device, like the wing of an airplane, or as a thrust producing  device, like the propeller on a piston engine.  

# Helicopter Structures and Airfoils  

The main parts that make up a helicopter are the cabin,  landing gear, tail boom, power plant, transmission, main  rotor, and tail rotor.  [Figure 5-81]  

# Main Rotor Systems  

In the fully articulated rotor system, the blades are attached  to the hub multiple times. The blades are hinged in a way  that allows them to move up and down and fore and aft, and  bearings provide for motion around the pitch change axis.  Rotor systems using this type of arrangement typically have  three or more blades. The hinge that allows the blades to move  

![](images/a95bf5d191f9f3d302679523e0c560d8d2ee1259819e4809d42c3dd1bbf6ba33.jpg)  
Figure 5-78.   Supersonic airfoil with oblique shock waves and  expansion waves.  

up and down is called the flap hinge, and movement around this  hinge is called flap. The hinge that allows the blades to move  fore and aft is called a drag or lag hinge. Movement around this  hinge is called dragging, lead/lag, or hunting. These hinges and  their associated movement are shown in  Figure 5-82 . The main  rotor head of a Eurocopter model 725 is shown in  Figure 5-83 with the drag hinge and pitch change rods visible.  

The semi-rigid rotor system is used with a two-blade main  rotor. The blades are rigidly attached to the hub, with the  hub and blades able to teeter like a seesaw. The teetering  action allows the blades to flap, with one blade dropping  down while the other blade rises. The blades are able to  change pitch independently of each other.  Figure 5-84 shows a Bell Jet Ranger helicopter in flight. This helicopter  uses a semi-rigid rotor system, which is evident because  of the way the rotor is tilted forward when the helicopter  is in forward flight.  

With a rigid rotor system, the blades are not hinged for  movement up and down, or flapping, or for movement fore  and aft, or drag. The blades are able to move around the pitch  change axis, with each blade being able to independently  change its blade angle. The rigid rotor system uses blades  that are very strong and yet flexible. They are flexible enough  to bend when they need to, without the use of hinges or a  teetering rotor, to compensate for the uneven lift that occurs  in forward flight. The Eurocopter model 135 uses a rigid  rotor system.  [Figure 5-85]  

# Anti-Torque Systems  

Any time a force is applied to make an object rotate;  there will be equal force acting in the opposite direction.  If the helicopter’s main rotor system rotates clockwise  when viewed from the top, the helicopter will try to rotate  counterclockwise. Earlier in this chapter, it was discovered  that torque is what tries to make something rotate. For this  reason, a helicopter uses what is called an anti-torque system  to counteract the force trying to make it rotate.  

One method that is used on a helicopter to counteract torque  is to place a spinning set of blades at the end of the tail boom.  These blades are called a tail rotor or anti-torque rotor, and  their purpose is to create a force, or thrust that acts in the  opposite direction of the way the helicopter is trying to rotate.  The tail rotor force, in pounds, multiplied by the distance  from the tail rotor to the main rotor, in feet, creates a torque  in pound-feet that counteracts the main rotor torque.  

Figure 5-86  shows a three-bladed tail rotor on an Aerospatiale  AS-315B helicopter. This tail rotor has open tipped blades  that are variable pitch, and the helicopter’s anti-torque pedals  that are positioned like rudder pedals on an airplane, control  the amount of thrust they create. Some potential problems  

![](images/414e3489d0e9f578614ee7967d1e737722f3330dbd08d5859b5cc337bfd83fe5.jpg)

Figure 5-80.   Double wedge and biconvex supersonic wing design.  

with this tail rotor system are as follows:  

•	 The spinning blades are deadly if someone walks into them. •	 When the helicopter is in forward flight and a vertical  fin may be in use to counteract torque, the tail rotor robs engine power and creates drag.  

An alternative to the tail rotor seen in  Figure 5-86  is a type of  anti-torque rotor known as a fenestron, or “fan-in-tail” design  as seen in  Figure 5-87 . The rotating blades present less of a  hazard to personnel on the ground and they create less drag  in flight, because they are enclosed in a shroud.  

A third method of counteracting the torque of the helicopter’s  main rotor is a technique called the “no tail rotor” system,  or NOTAR. This system uses a high volume of air at low  pressure, which comes from a fan driven by the helicopter’s  engine. The fan forces air into the tail boom, where a portion  of it exits out of slots on the right side of the boom and,  in conjunction with the main rotor downwash, creates a  phenomenon called the “Coanda effect.” The air coming  out of the slots on the right side of the boom causes a higher  velocity, and therefore lower pressure, on that side of the  boom. The higher pressure on the left side of the boom creates  the primary force that counteracts the torque of the main rotor.  

![](images/b100868023dc32e05374fdd53cf320e2fe905f6f75fa7d9528fd0a7c09066c90.jpg)  
Figure 5-81.   Main components of a helicopter.  

The remainder of the air travels back to a controllable rotating  nozzle in the helicopter’s tail. The air exits the nozzle at a  high velocity, and creates an additional force, or thrust, that  helps counteracts the torque of the main rotor. A NOTAR  system is shown in  Figures 5-88  and  5-89 .  

For helicopters with two main rotors, such as the Chinook that  has a main rotor at each end, no anti-torque rotor is needed.  For this type of helicopter, the two main rotors turn in opposite  directions, and each one cancels out the torque of the other.  

# Helicopter Axes of Flight  

Helicopters, like airplanes, have a vertical, lateral, and  longitudinal axis that passes through the helicopter’s center  of gravity. Helicopters yaw around the vertical axis, pitch  around the lateral axis, and rotate around the longitudinal  axis.  Figure 5-90  shows the three axes of a helicopter and  how they relate to the helicopter’s movement. All three axes  will intersect at the helicopter’s center of gravity, and the  helicopter pivots around this point. Notice in the figure that  the vertical axis passes almost through the center of the main  rotor, because the helicopter’s center of gravity needs to be  very close to this point.  

# Control Around the Vertical Axis  

For a single main rotor helicopter, control around the vertical  axis is handled by the anti-torque rotor, or tail rotor, or from  the fan’s airflow on a NOTAR type helicopter. Like in an  airplane, rotation around this axis is known as yaw. The pilot  controls yaw by pushing on the anti-torque pedals located on  the cockpit floor, in the same way the airplane pilot controls  yaw by pushing on the rudder pedals. To make the nose of

the helicopter yaw to the right, the pilot pushes on the right  anti-torque pedal. When viewed from the top, if the helicopter  tries to spin in a counterclockwise direction because of the  torque of the main rotor, the pilot will also push on the right  anti-torque pedal to counteract the main rotor torque. By  using the anti-torque pedals, the pilot can intentionally make  the helicopter rotate in either direction around the vertical  axis. The anti-torque pedals can be seen in  Figure 5-91.  

Some helicopters have a vertical stabilizer, such as those  shown in  Figures 5-90  and  5-92 . In forward flight, the vertical  stabilizer creates a force that helps counteract the torque of  the main rotor, thereby reducing the power needed to drive  the anti-torque system located at the end of the tail boom.  

# Control Around the Longitudinal and Lateral Axes  

Movement around the longitudinal and lateral axes is handled  by the helicopter’s main rotor. In the cockpit, there are two  levers that control the main rotor, known as the collective and  cyclic pitch controls. The collective pitch lever is on the side  of the pilot’s seat, and the cyclic pitch lever is at the front of  the seat in the middle.  [Figure 5-91]  

![](images/7d66f868485cb956f1040439243e2d78cc3a3cd7a4165b623777764fa33d83a5.jpg)  
Figure 5-86.   Aerospatiale helicopter tail rotor.  

When the collective pitch control lever is raised, the blade  angle of all the rotor blades increases uniformly and they  create the lift that allows the helicopter to take off vertically.  The grip on the end of the collective pitch control is the  throttle for the engine, which is rotated to increase engine  power as the lever is raised. On many helicopters, the throttle  automatically rotates and increases engine power as the  collective lever is raised. The collective pitch lever may have  adjustable friction built into it, so the pilot does not have to  hold upward pressure on it during flight.  

The cyclic pitch control lever, like the yoke of an airplane, can  be pulled back or pushed forward, and can be moved left and  right. When the cyclic pitch lever is pushed forward, the rotor  blades create more lift as they pass through the back half of  their rotation and less lift as they pass through the front half.  The difference in lift is caused by changing the blade angle,  or pitch, of the rotor blades. The pitch change rods that were  seen earlier, in  Figures 5-82  and  5-83 , are controlled by the  cyclic pitch lever and they are what change the pitch of the rotor  blades. The increased lift in the back either causes the main  rotor to tilt forward, the nose of the helicopter to tilt downward,  or both. The end result is the helicopter moves in the forward  direction. If the cyclic pitch lever is pulled back, the rotor blade  lift will be greater in the front and the helicopter will back up.  

If the cyclic pitch lever is moved to the left or the right, the  helicopter will bank left or bank right. For the helicopter to  bank to the right, the main rotor blades must create more lift  as they pass by the left side of the helicopter. Just the opposite  is true if the helicopter is banking to the left. By creating

more lift in the back than in the front, and more lift on the

left than on the right, the helicopter can be in forward flight  and banking to the right. In  Figure 5-92 , an Agusta A-109  can be seen in forward flight and banking to the right. The  rotor blade in the rear and the one on the left are both in an  upward raised position, meaning they have both experienced  the condition called flap.  

Some helicopters use a horizontal stabilizer, similar to what  is seen on an airplane, to help provide additional stability  around the lateral axis. A horizontal stabilizer can be seen  on the Agusta A-109 in  Figure 5-92 .  

# Helicopters in Flight  

# Hovering  

For a helicopter, hovering means that it is in flight at a constant  altitude, with no forward, aft, or sideways movement. In order  to hover, a helicopter must be producing enough lift in its  main rotor blades to equal the weight of the aircraft. The  engine of the helicopter must be producing enough power  to drive the main rotor, and also to drive whatever type of  anti-torque system is being used. The ability of a helicopter  

![](images/105a7ff2411e946696fa447fd19439380c6695c45bb1fb16e550c6d42b9aeef0.jpg)  
Figure 5-90.   Three axes of rotation for a helicopter.  

to hover is affected by many things, including whether or  not it is in ground effect, the density altitude of the air, the  available power from the engine, and how heavily loaded it is.  

For a helicopter to experience ground effect, it typically needs  to be no higher off the ground than one half of its main rotor  system diameter. If a helicopter has a main rotor diameter of 40  ft., it will be in ground effect up to an altitude of approximately  20 ft. Being close to the ground affects the velocity of the  air through the rotor blades, causing the effective angle of  attack of the blades to increase and the lift to increase. So, if  a helicopter is in ground effect, it can hover at a higher gross  weight than it can when out of ground effect. On a windy day,  the positive influence of ground effect is lessened, and at a  forward speed of 5 to  $10\,\mathrm{mph}$   the positive influence becomes  less. In  Figure 5-93 , an Air Force CH-53 is seen in a hover, with  all the rotor blades flapping up as a result of creating equal lift.  

# Forward Flight  

In the early days of helicopter development, the ability to  hover was mastered before there was success in attaining  forward flight. The early attempts at forward flight resulted  in the helicopter rolling over when it tried to depart from the  hover and move in any direction. The cause of the rollover  is what we now refer to as dissymmetry of lift.  

When a helicopter is in a hover, all the rotor blades are  experiencing the same velocity of airflow and the velocity  of the airflow seen by the rotor blades changes when the  helicopter starts to move. For helicopters built in the United  States, the main rotor blades turn in a counterclockwise  direction when viewed from the top. Viewed from the top, as  the blades move around the right side of the helicopter, they  are moving toward the nose; as they move around the left side  of the helicopter, they are moving toward the tail. When the  helicopter starts moving forward, the blade on the right side  is moving toward the relative wind, and the blade on the left  

![](images/84ab83245fd94b6e72a410e086dfa9becd1ceb95a4d9cf9004b4341581ecceef.jpg)

side is moving away from the relative wind. This causes the  blade on the right side to create more lift and the blade on the  left side to create less lift.  Figure 5-94  shows how this occurs. In  Figure 5-94 , blade number 2 would be called the advancing  blade, and blade number 1 would be called the retreating  blade. The advancing blade is moving toward the relative  wind, and therefore experiences a greater velocity of airflow.  The increased lift created by the blade on the right side will  try to roll the helicopter to the left. If this condition is allowed  to exist, it will ultimately lead to the helicopter crashing.  

# Blade Flapping  

To solve the problem of dissymmetry of lift, helicopter  designers came up with a hinged design that allows the rotor  blade to flap up when it experiences increased lift, and to flap  down when it experiences decreased lift. When a rotor blade  advances toward the front of the helicopter and experiences  an increased velocity of airflow, the increase in lift causes the  blade to flap up. This upward motion of the blade changes  the direction of the relative wind in relation to the chord  line of the blade, and causes the angle of attack to decrease.  The decrease in the angle of attack decreases the lift on the  blade. The retreating blade experiences a reduced velocity  of airflow and reduced lift, and flaps down. By flapping  down, the retreating blade ends up with an increased angle  of attack and an increase in lift. The end result is the lift on  the blades is equalized, and the tendency for the helicopter  to roll never materializes.  

The semi-rigid and fully articulated rotor systems have  

![](images/fcf13dadd62bcba9eca9e424e21ff18717e733af2a2cf45a7eacf579cefb0a93.jpg)  
Figure 5-92.   Agusta A-109 banking to the right.  

flapping hinges that automatically allow the blades to move  up or down with changes in lift. The rigid type of rotor system  has blades that are flexible enough to bend up or down with  changes in lift.  

# Advancing Blade and Retreating Blade Problems  

The blade advancing toward the relative wind sees the airflow  at an ever increasing velocity as a helicopter flies forward at  higher and higher speeds. Eventually, the velocity of the air  over the rotor blade will reach sonic velocity, much like the  critical Mach number for the wing of an airplane. When this  happens, a shock wave will form and the air will separate  from the rotor blade, resulting in a high-speed stall.  

As the helicopters forward speed increases, the relative wind  over the retreating blade decreases, resulting in a loss of lift.  The loss of lift causes the blade to flap down and the effective  angle of attack to increase. At a high enough forward speed,  the angle of attack will increase to a point that the rotor blade  stalls. The tip of the blade stalls first, and then progresses in  toward the blade root.  

When approximately 25 percent of the rotor system is stalled,  due to the problems with the advancing and retreating blades,  control of the helicopter will be lost. Conditions that will  lead to the rotor blades stalling include high forward speed,  heavy gross weight, turbulent air, high-density altitude, and  steep or abrupt turns.  

# Autorotation  

The engine on a helicopter drives the main rotor system by way  of a clutch and a transmission. The clutch allows the engine  to be running and the rotor system not to be turning, while the  helicopter is on the ground, and it also allows the rotor system  to disconnect from the engine while in flight, if the engine  fails. Having the rotor system disconnect from the engine in  the event of an engine failure is necessary if the helicopter is  to be capable of a flight condition called autorotation.  

Autorotation is a flight condition where the main rotor blades  are driven by the force of the relative wind passing through  the blades, rather than by the engine. This flight condition  is similar to an airplane gliding if its engine fails while in  

![](images/25bc39065b448d93cce64f2d2eba6146a4d8fdd99ac9c4dbc28118a5eff6b796.jpg)

flight. As long as the helicopter maintains forward airspeed,  while decreasing altitude and the pilot lowers the blade  angle on the blades with the collective pitch, the rotor blades  will continue to rotate. The altitude of the helicopter, which  equals potential energy, is given up in order to have enough  energy, which will then be kinetic energy, to keep the rotor  blades turning. As the helicopter nears the ground, the cyclic  pitch control is used to slow the forward speed and to flare  the helicopter for landing. With the airspeed bled off, and  the helicopter now close to the ground, the final step is to  use the collective pitch control to cushion the landing. The  airflow through the rotor blades in normal forward flight and  in an autorotation flight condition are shown in  Figure 5-95 .  In  Figure 5-96 , a Bell Jet Ranger is shown approaching the  ground in the final stage of an autorotation.  

# Weight-Shift Control, Flexible Wing Aircraft  Aerodynamics  

A weight-shift control, flexible wing type aircraft consists of  a fabric-covered wing, often referred to as the sail, attached to  a tubular structure that has wheels, seats, and an engine and  propeller. The wing structure is also tubular, with the fabric  covering creating the airfoil shape. The shape of the wing varies  among the different models of weight-shift control aircraft  being produced, but a delta shaped wing is a very popular  design. Within the weight-shift control aircraft community,  these aircraft are typically referred to as trikes.  [Figure 5-97]  

In  Figure 5-97 , the trike’s mast is attached to the wing at the  hang point on the keel of the wing with a hang point bolt and  safety cable. There is also a support tube, known as a king post,  extending up from the top of the wing, with cables running  down and secured to the tubular wing structure. The cables  

![](images/2d4b77151d8638ba741eb026a44bf42a16b5d8ef32fb49729781900f1925036f.jpg)  
Figure 5-94.   Dissymmetry of lift for rotor blades.  

running down from the king post as part of the upper rigging  are there to support the wing when the aircraft is on the ground,  and to handle negative loads when in flight. The lines that run  from the king post to the trailing edge of the wing are known  as reflex cables. These cables maintain the shape of the wing  when it is in a stalled state by holding the trailing edge of the  wing up which helps raise the nose during recovery from the  stall. If the aircraft goes into an inadvertent stall, having the  trailing edge of the wing in a slightly raised position helps raise  the nose of the aircraft and get it out of the dive. The passenger  seat is centered under the wing’s aerodynamic center, with the  weight of the pilot being forward of this point and the weight  of the engine and propeller being aft.  

Unlike a traditional airplane, the trike does not have a rudder,  elevator, or ailerons. Instead, it has a wing that can be pivoted  forward or aft, and left or right. In  Figure 5-98,  the pilot’s hand  is on a control bar that is connected to a pivot point just forward  of where the wing attaches. There are cables attached to the  ends of the bar that extend up to the wing’s leading and trailing  edge, and to the left and right side of the cross bar. Running  from the wing leading edge to trailing edge are support pieces  known as battens. The battens fit into pockets, and they give the  wing its cambered shape. The names of some of the primary  parts of the trike are shown in  Figure 5-98 , and these parts  will be referred to when the flight characteristics of the trike  are described in the paragraphs that follow.  

In order to fly the trike, engine power is applied to get the  aircraft moving. As the groundspeed of the aircraft reaches a  point where flight is possible, the pilot pushes forward on the  control bar, which causes the wing to pivot where it attaches  to the mast and the leading edge of the wing tilts up. When  the leading edge of the wing tilts up, the angle of attack and  the lift of the wing increase. With sufficient lift, the trike  rotates and starts climbing. Pulling back on the bar reduces  the angle of attack, and allows the aircraft to stop climbing  and to fly straight and level. Once the trike is in level flight,  airspeed can be increased or decreased by adding engine  power or taking away engine power by use of the throttle.  

Stability in flight along the longitudinal axis, which is a  nose to tail measurement, for a typical airplane, is achieved  by having the horizontal stabilizer and elevator generate a  force that balances out the airplane’s nose heavy tendency.  

It must create stability along the longitudinal axis in a different  way because the trike does not have a horizontal stabilizer or  elevator. The trike has a sweptback delta wing, with the trailing  edge of the wingtips located well aft of the aircraft center of  gravity. Pressure acting on the tips of the delta wing creates  the force that balances out the nose heavy tendency.

Figure 5-95.   Rotor blade airflow during normal flight and during  autorotation.  

The wings of weight-shift control aircraft are designed in a  way that allows them to change their shape when subjected  to an external force. This is possible because the frame  leading edges and the sail are flexible, which is why they are  sometimes referred to as flexible wing aircraft. This produces  somewhat different aerodynamic effects when compared with  

![](images/f2d84908a1f36544b0b4d53251f21545a49187a804a4bd82a2736717d7c0b1b5.jpg)

a normal fixed-wing aircraft. A traditional small airplane, like  a Cessna 172, turns or banks by using the ailerons, effectively  altering the camber of the wing and thereby generating  differential lift. By comparison, weight shift on a trike  actually causes the wing to twist, which changes the angle of  attack on the wing and causes the differential lift to exist that  banks the trike. The cross-bar, or wing spreader, of the wing  frame is allowed to float slightly with respect to the keel, and  this, along with some other geometric considerations allows  the sail to “billow shift.” Billow shift can be demonstrated  on the ground by grabbing the trailing edge of one end of  the wing and lifting up on it. If this was done, the fabric on  the other end of the wing would become slightly flatter and  tighter, and the wing’s angle of attack would increase.  

If the pilot pushes the bar to the right, the wing pivots with  the left wingtip dropping down and the right wingtip rising  up, causing the aircraft to bank to the left. This motion is  depicted in  Figure 5-99 , showing a hang glider as an example.  The shift in weight to the left increases the wing loading on  the left, and lessens it on the right. The increased loading on  the left wing increases its washout and reduces its angle of  attack and lift. The increased load on the left wing causes the  left wing to billow, which causes the fabric to tighten on the  right wing and the angle of attack and lift to increase. The  change in lift is what banks the aircraft to the left. Billow on  the left wing is depicted in  Figure 5-100.  

Shifting weight to the right causes the aircraft to bank right.  The weight of the trike and its occupants acts like a pendulum,  and helps keep the aircraft stable in flight. Pushing or pulling  on the bar while in flight causes the weight hanging below  the wing to shift its position relative to the wing, which is  why the trike is referred to as a weight-shift aircraft.  

Once the trike is in flight and flying straight and level, the  pilot only needs to keep light pressure on the bar that controls  

![](images/920d9d80c51c78c88aacf50cc8a039e9aad371beff8c924daa8a8759bb8155cd.jpg)

the wing. If the trike is properly balanced and there is no air  turbulence, the aircraft will remain stable even if the pilot’s  hands are removed from the bar. The same as with any airplane,  increasing engine power will make the aircraft climb and  decreasing power will make it descend. The throttle is typically  controlled with a foot pedal, like a gas pedal in an automobile.  

A trike lands in a manner very similar to an airplane. When it  is time to land, the pilot reduces engine power with the foot- operated throttle; causing airspeed and wing lift to decrease.  As the trike descends, the rate of descent can be controlled by  pushing forward or pulling back on the bar, and varying engine  power. When the trike is almost to the point of touchdown, the  engine power will be reduced and the angle of attack of the  wing will be increased, to cushion the descent and provide a  smooth landing. If the aircraft is trying to land in a very strong  crosswind, the landing may not be so smooth. When landing in  a cross wind, the pilot will land in a crab to maintain direction  down the runway.  Touchdown is done with the back wheels  first, then letting the front wheel down.  

A trike getting ready to touch down can be seen in  Figure 5-101 . The control cables coming off the control bar  can be seen, and the support mast and the cables on top of  the wing, including the luff lines, can also be seen.  

# Powered Parachute Aerodynamics  

A powered parachute has a carriage very similar to the  weight-shift control aircraft. Its wing, however, has no  support structure or rigidity and only takes on the shape of an  airfoil when it is inflated by the blast of air from the propeller  and the forward speed of the aircraft. In  Figure 5-102 , a  powered parachute is on its approach to land with the wing  fully inflated and rising up above the aircraft. Each colored  section of the inflated wing is made up of cells that are open in  the front to allow air to ram in, and closed in the back to keep  the air trapped inside. In between all the cells there are holes  that allow the air to flow from one cell to the next, in order  to equalize the pressure within the inflated wing. The wing  is attached to the carriage of the aircraft by a large number of  nylon or Kevlar lines that run from the tips of the wing all the  way to the center. The weight of the aircraft acting on these  lines and their individual lengths cause the inflated wing to  take its shape. The lines attach to the body of the aircraft at a  location very close to where the center of gravity is located,  and this attachment point is adjustable to account for balance  changes with occupants of varying weights.  

As in weight-shift control aircraft, the powered parachute  does not have the traditional flight controls of a fixed-wing  airplane. When the wing of the aircraft is inflated and the  aircraft starts moving forward, the wing starts generating lift.  Once the groundspeed is sufficient for the wing’s lift greater  than the weight of the aircraft, the aircraft lifts off the ground.  

![](images/07dff0c4c518fb96cc4e4a3572636398353f126d24c98dd97810d4f82a015a41.jpg)  
Figure 5-98.   Weight-shift control aircraft getting ready for flight.  

Unlike an airplane, where the pilot has a lot of control over  when the airplane rotates by deciding when to pull back on the  yoke, the powered parachute will not take off until it reaches  a specific airspeed. The powered parachute will typically lift  off the ground at a speed somewhere between 28 and  $30\,\mathrm{mph}$  ,  and will have airspeed in flight of approximately  $30\,\mathrm{mph}$  .  

![](images/900e18da54b6490d9ff5a50f520c8d61d24a9594258ec7f72460e20e52c3cc1c.jpg)

and descending is handled with engine power. Advancing  the throttle makes the aircraft climb, and retarding the  throttle makes it descend. The inflated wing creates a lot  of drag in flight, so reducing the engine power creates a  very controllable descent of the aircraft. The throttle, for  controlling engine power, is typically located on the right- hand side of the pilot.  [Figure 5-103]  

Turning of the powered parachute in flight is handled by  foot-operated pedals, or steering bars, located at the front of  the aircraft. These bars can be seen in  Figure 5-103 . Each  

![](images/5ab5afb33bb60c0c14c44a3d9c42173a67895fbb2bb70bc7320fc3f2447b73a2.jpg)  
Figure 5-100.   Weight shift to the left causing a left-hand turn.  

foot-operated pedal controls a set of lines, usually made  from nylon that runs up to the trailing edge of each wingtip.  When the right foot pedal is pushed, the line pulls down on  the tailing edge of the 8 wingtip. As the trailing edge of the  right wing drop downs, drag is increased on the right side and  the aircraft turns right. When pressure is taken off the foot  pedal, the drag in the entire airfoil equalizes and the aircraft  resumes its straight-and-level flight.  

To land a powered parachute, the first action the pilot takes  is to reduce engine power and allow the aircraft to descend.  With the power reduced to idle, the aircraft will descend at a  rate of approximately 5 to 10 fps. As the aircraft approaches  the ground, the descent rate can be lessened by increasing  the engine power. Just before touchdown, the pilot pushes on  both foot-operated pedals to drop the trailing edges on both  sides of the wing. This action increases the drag on the wing  uniformly, causing the wing to pivot aft, which raises the  wing leading edge and increases the angle of attack and lift.  

![](images/4fc16a0514905b6f3d83440893fe38db625cb662b3c4ee8dec37142497b64716.jpg)  
Figure 5-102.   Powered parachute with the wing inflated.  

In  Figure 5-104 , the pilot is pushing on both foot pedals and  the left and right wing trailing edges are deflected downward.  The aircraft has just touched down and the wing is trailing  behind the aircraft, caused by the high angle of attack and  the additional drag on the wing. The increase in lift reduces  the descent rate to almost nothing, and provides for a gentle  landing. If the pilot pushes on the foot pedals too soon, the  wing may pivot too far aft before touchdown resulting in an  unacceptable descent rate. In that case, it might be a relatively  hard landing.

# Chapter 6 Aircraft Weight & Balance  

# Introduction  

The weight of an aircraft and its balance are extremely  important for operating in a safe and efficient manner. When  a manufacturer designs an aircraft and the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) certifies it, the specifications identify  the aircraft’s maximum weight and the limits within which  it must balance. The weight and balance system commonly  employed among aircraft consists of three equally important  elements: the weighing of the aircraft, the maintaining of  the weight and balance records, and the proper loading of  the aircraft.  

The maximum weight of an aircraft is based on the amount  of lift the wings or rotors can provide under the operating  conditions for which the aircraft is designed. For example,  if a small general aviation (GA) airplane required a takeoff  speed of 200 miles per hour (mph) to generate enough lift  to support its weight, that would not be safe. Taking off and  landing at lower airspeeds is certainly safer than doing so  at higher speeds.  

Aircraft balance is also a significant factor in determining  if the aircraft is safe to operate. An aircraft that does not  have good balance can exhibit poor maneuverability and  controllability, making it difficult or impossible to fly. This  could result in an accident, causing damage to the aircraft and  injury to the people on board. Safety is the primary reason  for concern about an aircraft’s weight and balance.  

Another important reason for concern about weight and  balance is the efficiency of the aircraft. Improper loading  reduces the efficiency of an aircraft from the standpoint  of ceiling, maneuverability, rate of climb, speed, and fuel  consumption. If an airplane is loaded in such a way that it is  extremely nose heavy, higher than normal forces are exerted  at the tail to keep the airplane in level flight. The higher than  normal forces at the tail create additional drag, which requires  additional engine power and therefore additional fuel flow  to maintain airspeed.  

The most efficient condition for an aircraft is to have the point  where it balances fall close to, or exactly at, the aircraft’s  center of lift. If this were the case, little or no flight control  force would be needed to keep the aircraft flying straight and  level. In terms of stability and safety, however, this perfectly  balanced condition might not be desirable. All factors that  affect aircraft safety and efficiency, in terms of its weight and  balance, are discussed in detail in this chapter.  

# Requirements for Aircraft Weighing  

Every aircraft type certificated by the FAA receives a weight  and balance report as part of its required aircraft records  before leaving the factory for delivery to its new owner.  The weight and balance report identifies the empty weight  of the aircraft and the location at which the aircraft balances,  known as the center of gravity (CG). The weight and balance  report must include an equipment list showing weights and  moment arms of all required and optional items of equipment  included in the certificated empty weight. If the manufacturer  chooses to do so, it can weigh every aircraft it produces and  issue the weight and balance report based on that weighing.  As an alternative, the manufacturer is permitted to weigh  an agreed upon percentage of a particular model of aircraft  produced, perhaps 10 to 20 percent, and apply the average  to all the aircraft.  

After the aircraft leaves the factory and is delivered to its  owner, the requirement for placing the aircraft on scales and  reweighing it varies depending on the type of aircraft and  how it is used. For a small, GA airplane being used privately,  such as a Cessna 172, there is no FAA requirement that it be  periodically reweighed; but after each annual, the mechanic  must ensure that the weight and balance data in the aircraft  records is correct. Additionally, there is an FAA requirement  that the airplane always have a current and accurate weight  and balance report. If the weight and balance report for an  aircraft is lost, the aircraft must be weighed and a new report  must be created. When an aircraft has undergone extensive  repair, major alteration, or has new equipment installed, such  as a radio or a global positioning system, a new weight and  balance report must be created. The equipment installer may  place the airplane on scales and weigh it after the installation,  which is an acceptable way of creating the new report. If  the installer knows the exact weight and location of the new  equipment, it is also possible to create a new report by doing  a series of mathematical calculations.  

Over time, almost all aircraft tend to gain weight. Examples  of how this can happen include an airplane being repainted  without the old paint being removed and the accumulation of  dirt, grease, and oil in parts of the aircraft that are not easily  accessible for cleaning. When new equipment is installed,  and its weight and location are mathematically accounted  for, some miscellaneous weight might be overlooked, such  as wire and hardware. For this reason, even if the FAA does  not require it, it is a good practice to periodically place an  aircraft on scales and confirm its actual empty weight and  empty weight center of gravity (EWCG).  

Some aircraft are required to be weighed and have their  CG calculated on a periodic basis, typically every 3 years.  Examples of aircraft that fall under this requirement are:  

1.	 Air taxi and charter twin-engine airplanes operating  under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 135, section 135.185(a). 2.	 Airplanes with a seating capacity of 20 or more  passengers or a maximum payload of 6,000 pounds  or more, as identified in 14 CFR part 125, section  125.91(b).  

# Weight & Balance Terminology  

# Datum  

The datum is an imaginary vertical plane from which all  horizontal measurements are taken for balance purposes, with  the aircraft in level flight attitude. If the datum is viewed on a  drawing of an aircraft, it would appear as a vertical line that is  perpendicular (90 degrees) to the aircraft’s longitudinal axis.  For each aircraft make and model, the location of all items  is identified in reference to the datum. For example, the fuel  in a tank might be 60 inches   $(60")$   behind the datum, and a  radio on the flight deck might be  $90"$   forward of the datum.  

The datum is determined by the manufacturer; it is often the  leading edge of the wing or some specific distance from an  easily identified location. Typical locations for the datum are  the aircraft nose, the leading edge of the wing, the helicopter’s  mast, or a specified distance from a known point. However,  most modern helicopters, like airplanes, have the datum  located at the nose of the aircraft or a specified distance  ahead of it.  Figure 6-1  shows an aircraft with the leading  edge of the wing being the datum. The distance from this  datum is measured in inches and can be either positive or  negative depending upon where the equipment is located in  relation to the datum.  

The location of the datum is identified in the Aircraft  Specifications or Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS).  Aircraft certified prior to 1958 fell under the Civil  Aeronautics Administration and had their weight and balance  information contained in a document known as Aircraft  Specifications. Aircraft certified since 1958 fall under  the FAA and have their weight and balance information  contained in a document known as a Type Certificate Data  Sheet (TCDS). The Aircraft Specifications typically included  the aircraft equipment list. For aircraft with a TCDS, the  equipment list is a separate document.  

# Arm  

The arm is the horizontal distance from the datum to any point  within the aircraft. The arm’s distance is always measured in  inches, and it is preceded by the algebraic sign for positive  $(+)$  or negative  $(-)$  , except for a location which might be exactly  on the datum. The positive sign indicates an item is located  aft of the datum, and the negative sign indicates an item is  located forward of the datum. If the manufacturer chooses  a datum that is at the most forward location on an aircraft,  all the arms will be positive numbers. Location of the datum  at any other point on the aircraft results in some arms being  positive numbers, or aft of the datum, and some arms being  negative numbers, or forward of the datum.  Figure 6-1  shows  an aircraft where the datum is the leading edge of the wing.  For this aircraft, any item (fuel, seat, radio, etc.) located  forward of the wing leading edge has a negative arm, and  any item located aft of the wing leading edge has a positive  arm. If an item is located exactly at the wing leading edge, its  arm would be zero, and mathematically it would not matter  whether its arm was positive or negative.  

The arm of each item is usually included in parentheses  immediately after the item’s name or weight in the Aircraft  Specifications, TCDS, or equipment list for the aircraft. For  example, in a TCDS, the fuel quantity might be identified  as 98 gallons (gal)   $(+93.6)$   and the forward baggage limit  as 100 pounds (lb)   $(-22.5)$  . These numbers indicate that the  fuel is located  $93.6"$   aft of the datum and the nose baggage is  located  $22.6"$   forward of the datum. If the arm for a piece of  equipment is not known, its exact location must be accurately  measured. When the arm for a piece of equipment is being  determined, the measurement is taken from the datum to the  piece of equipment’s own CG.  

# Moment  

To understand balance, it is necessary to have a working  knowledge of the principle of moments. For those unfamiliar  with weight and balance terms, the word moment is the  product of a force or weight times a distance. The distance  used in calculating a moment is referred to as the arm or  moment arm and is usually expressed in inches. To calculate  a moment, a force (or weight) and a distance must be known.  The weight is multiplied by the distance from the datum and  the result is the moment, which is expressed in inch-pounds  (in-lb), a point through which the force acts. For the purpose  of illustration, compare an aircraft to a seesaw. Like the  seesaw, for an aircraft to be in balance, or equilibrium, the  

![](images/d63d8eee717316c4e57abaf9f98b279432556b31560a280be8e46e45092e3bbe.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.   Datum location and its effect on positive and negative  arms.  

sum of the moments on each side of the balance point must be  equal. Therefore, the same weight that is different distances  (in inches) from the datum have greater moments.  

A 5 lb radio located  $80"$   from the datum would have a moment  of 400 in-lb   $(5\,1\mathrm{b}\times80")$  ). A 10-pound radio located  $12"$   from  the datum would have a moment of 120 in-lb. Whether the  moment is preceded by a positive   $(+)$   or negative   $(-)$   sign  depends on its location in relation to the datum.  Figure 6-2 shows where the moment ends up being a positive number  because the weight and arm are both positive.  

The algebraic sign of the moment, based on the datum  location and whether weight is being installed or removed  [Figure 6-3] , would be as follows:  

•	 Weight being added aft of the datum produces a  positive moment (  $\cdot+$  weight,  $+\mathrm{arm}$  ). •	 Weight being added forward of the datum produces a  negative moment (  $\cdot_{+}$  weight, −arm). •	 Weight being removed aft of the datum produces a  negative moment (−weight,  $+\mathrm{arm}$  ). •	 Weight being removed forward of the datum produces  a positive moment (−weight, −arm).  

When dealing with positive and negative numbers, remember  that the product of like signs produces a positive answer,  and the product of unlike signs produces a negative answer.  

# Center of Gravity (CG)  

The CG is the point at which all the weight of the aircraft  is concentrated and balanced; therefore, the aircraft can  be supported at that point (the CG). The magnitude of the  nose-heavy and tail-heavy moments are exactly equal. It is  the balance point for the aircraft and, if suspended from this  point, there would be no tendency to rotate in a noseup or  nosedown attitude.  

Figure 6-4  shows a lever with the pivot point (called a  fulcrum) located at the CG for the lever. Even though the  weights on either side of the fulcrum are not equal, and the  distances from each weight to the fulcrum are not equal, the  product of the weights and arms (moments) are equal, and  that is what produces a balanced condition. Therefore, the  lever would be balanced much like two persons sitting on  a seesaw who are differing weights and located at different  distances from the fulcrum.  

# Maximum Weight  

The maximum weight is the maximum authorized weight  of the aircraft and its contents, and is indicated in the  Aircraft Specifications or TCDS. For many aircraft, there  are variations to the maximum allowable weight depending  on the purpose and conditions under which the aircraft is to  be flown. For example, a certain aircraft may be allowed a  maximum gross weight of 2,750 lb when flown in the normal  category, but when flown in the utility category, which  allows for limited aerobatics, the same aircraft’s maximum  allowable gross weight might only be 2,175 lb. There are  other variations when dealing with the concept of maximum  weight, as follows:  

•	 Maximum Ramp Weight—the heaviest weight to  which an aircraft can be loaded while it is sitting on the  ground. This is sometimes referred to as the maximum  taxi weight. •	 Maximum Takeoff Weight—the heaviest weight an  aircraft can be when it starts the takeoff roll. The  difference between this weight and the maximum  ramp weight would equal the weight of the fuel that  would be consumed prior to takeoff. •	 Maximum Landing Weight—the heaviest weight an  aircraft can be when it lands. For large, wide body  commercial airplanes, it can be 100,000 lb less than  maximum takeoff weight, or even more. •	 Maximum Zero Fuel Weight—the heaviest weight an  aircraft can be loaded to without having any usable  fuel in the fuel tanks. Any weight loaded above this  value must be in the form of fuel.

# Empty Weight  

The empty weight of an aircraft includes all operating  equipment that has a fixed location and is actually installed in  the aircraft. It includes the weight of the airframe, powerplant,  required equipment, optional or special equipment, fixed  ballast, hydraulic fluid, and residual fuel and oil. Residual fuel  and oil are the fluids that do not normally drain out because  they are trapped in the fuel lines, oil lines, and tanks. They must  be included in the aircraft’s empty weight. For most aircraft  certified after 1978, the full capacity of the engine oil system  is also included in the empty weight. Information regarding  residual fluids in aircraft systems that must be included in the  empty weight, and whether or not full oil is included, will be  indicated in the Aircraft Specifications or TCDS.  

Other terms that are used when describing empty weight  include basic empty weight, licensed empty weight, and  standard empty weight. The term “basic empty weight”  applies when the full capacity of the engine oil system is  included in the value. The term “licensed empty weight”  applies when only the weight of residual oil is included in  the value, so it generally involves only aircraft certified prior  to 1978. Standard empty weight would be a value supplied  by the aircraft manufacturer, and it would not include any  optional equipment that might be installed in an aircraft. For  most people working in the aviation maintenance field, the  basic empty weight of the aircraft is the most important one.  

# Empty Weight Center of Gravity (EWCG)  

The EWCG for an aircraft is the point at which it balances  when it is in an empty weight condition. The concepts of  empty weight and CG were discussed earlier in this chapter,  and now they are being combined into a single concept.  

One of the most important reasons for weighing an aircraft  is to determine its EWCG. All other weight and balance  calculations, including loading the aircraft for flight,  performing an equipment change calculation, and performing  an adverse condition check, begin with knowing the empty  weight and EWCG. This crucial information is part of what  is contained in the aircraft weight and balance report.

# Useful Load  

To determine the useful load of an aircraft, subtract the  empty weight from the maximum allowable gross weight.  For aircraft certificated in both normal and utility categories,  there may be two useful loads listed in the aircraft weight and  balance records. An aircraft with an empty weight of 3,100 lb  may have a useful load of 850 lb, if the normal category  maximum weight is listed as 3,950 lb. When the aircraft is  operated in the utility category, the maximum gross weight  may be reduced to 3,700 lb, with a corresponding decrease in  the useful load to 600 lb. Some aircraft have the same useful  load regardless of the category in which they are certificated.  

The useful load consists of fuel, any other fluids that are not  part of empty weight, passengers, baggage, pilot, copilot, and  crewmembers. Whether the weight of engine oil is considered  part of the useful load depends on when the aircraft was  certificated and can be determined by looking at the Aircraft  Specifications or TCDS. The payload of an aircraft is like the  useful load, except it does not include fuel.  

A reduction in the weight of an item, where possible, may be  necessary to remain within the maximum weight allowed for  the category in which an aircraft is operating. Determining  the distribution of these weights is called a weight check.  

# Minimum Fuel  

Many modern aircraft have multiple rows of seats and often  more than one baggage compartment. The weight and balance  extreme conditions represent the maximum forward and  rearward CG position for the aircraft. An aircraft has certain  fixed points, fore and aft, beyond which the CG should not  be permitted at any time during flight. A check should be  made to ensure that the CG will not shift out of limits when  crew, passengers, cargo, and expendable weights are added  or removed. If the limits are exceeded and the aircraft is  flown in this condition, it may lead to insufficient stability,  with resulting difficulty in controlling the aircraft. After any  repair or alteration that changes the weight and balance, the  Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) mechanic or repairman  must ensure that no legal condition of loading can move the  CG outside of its allowable limits. To determine this, the  mechanic will deliberately attempt to calculate the aircraft  loading in such a manner as to place the CG outside the  limits of the aircraft. This is called an adverse-loading check.  

For example, in a forward adverse-loaded CG check, all  useful load in front of the forward CG limit is loaded, and  all useful load behind this limit is left empty. An exception  to leaving it empty is the fuel tank. If the fuel tank is located  behind the forward CG limit, it cannot be left empty because  the aircraft cannot fly without fuel. In this case, an amount  of fuel is accounted for, which is known as minimum fuel.  Minimum fuel is the amount needed for 30 minutes of flight  at cruise power.  

For weight and balance purposes, the minimum fuel is no  more than the quantity needed for one half hour of operation  at rated maximum continuous power. This is   $\%_{12}$   gallon  for each maximum except takeoff (METO) horsepower  (hp). Because aviation gasoline (Avgas) weighs 6 pounds  per gallon   $(1{\tt b}/{\tt g a l})$  ), determine the number of pounds of  the minimum fuel by dividing the METO hp by 2. For  instance, an aircraft having a METO hp of 200 hp will have  a minimum fuel of 16.65 gallons or 99.99 pounds. An even  simpler way is to take the METO hp divided by 2, which is  100 pounds. Both methods in determining minimum fuel  are valued and result in essentially the same answer. In the  latter computation, a piston engine in cruise flight burns 1  lb of fuel per hour for each hp, or  $\%$   lb for 30 minutes, hence  dividing the METO by 2.  

For example, if a forward adverse-loaded CG check was  performed on a piston engine aircraft, with the engine having  a METO hp of 200, the minimum fuel would be 100 lb (200   ${\mathrm{METO\,hyp}}\div2)$  .  

For turbine engine-powered aircraft, minimum fuel is not  based on engine hp. If an adverse-loaded CG check is being  performed on a turbine engine-powered aircraft, the aircraft  manufacturer would need to supply information on minimum  fuel.  

# Tare Weight  

When aircraft are placed on scales and weighed, it is  sometimes necessary to use support equipment to aid in  the weighing process. For example, to weigh a tail dragger  airplane, it is necessary to raise the tail to get the airplane  level. To level the airplane, a jack might be placed on the  scale and used to raise the tail. Unfortunately, the scale is now  absorbing the weight of the jack in addition to the weight of  the airplane. This extra weight is known as tare weight and  must be subtracted from the scale reading. Other examples of  tare weight are wheel chocks placed on the scales and ground  locks left in place on retractable landing gear.  

# Procedures for Weighing an Aircraft  

# General Concepts  

The most important reason for weighing an aircraft is to find  out its empty weight (basic empty weight) and to find out  where it balances in the empty weight condition. When an  aircraft is to be flown, the pilot-in-command must know what  the loaded weight of the aircraft is and where its loaded CG  is. For the loaded weight and CG to be calculated, the pilot  or dispatcher handling the flight must first know the empty  weight and EWCG.  

Earlier in this chapter it was identified that the CG for an  object is the point about which the nose heavy and tail heavy  moments are equal. One method that could be used to find  this point would involve lifting an object off the ground twice,  first suspending it from a point near the front, and on the  second lift suspending it from a point near the back. With each  lift, a perpendicular line (90 degrees) would be drawn from  the suspension point to the ground. The two perpendicular  lines would intersect somewhere in the object, and the point  of intersection would be the CG. This concept is shown in  Figure 6-5 , where an airplane is suspended from two different  points. The perpendicular line from the first suspension point  is shown in red, and the new suspension point line is shown  as a blue plumb bob. Where the red and blue lines intersect  is the CG. If an airplane were suspended from two points,  one at the nose and one at the tail, the perpendicular drop  lines would intersect at the CG. Suspending an airplane from  the ceiling by two hooks, however, is clearly not realistic.  Even if it could be done, determining where in the airplane  the lines intersect would be difficult.  

A more realistic way to find the CG for an object, especially  an airplane, is to place it on a minimum of two scales and  calculate the moment value for each scale reading. In  Figure 6-6,  there is a plank that is  $200"$   long, with the left  end being the datum (zero arm), and 6 weights placed at  various locations along the length of the plank. The purpose  of  Figure 6-6  is to show how the CG can be calculated when  the arms and weights for an object are known.  

To calculate the CG for the object in  Figure 6-6,  the moments  for all the weights need to be calculated and then summed,  and the weights need to be summed. In the four-column  table in  Figure 6-7,  the item, weight, and arm are listed in  the first three columns, with the information coming from  Figure 6-6.  The moment value in the fourth column is the  product of the weight and arm. The weight and moment  columns are summed, with the CG being equal to the total  moment divided by the total weight. The arm column is not  summed. The number appearing at the bottom of that column  is the CG. The calculation is shown in  Figure 6-7.  

For the calculation in  Figure 6-7,  the total moment is 52,900  in-lb, and the total weight is 495 lb. The CG is calculated  as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{CG}}&{=\mathrm{~Total~Moment}\div\mathrm{Total~Weyl}}\\ &{=\,52{,}900\;\mathrm{in{-}l b}\div495\;\mathrm{l b}}\\ &{=\,106.9"\,(106.87\,\mathrm{rounded~to}\,\mathrm{to}\,\mathrm{to}\,}\end{array}
$$  

An interesting characteristic exists for the problem in  Figure 6-6  and the table showing the CG calculation. If the  datum (zero arm) for the object was in the middle of the  $200"$    long plank, with  $100"$   of negative arm to the left and   $100"$   of  positive arm to the right, the solution would show the CG to  be in the same location. The arm for the CG would not be the  same number, but its physical location would be the same.  Figures 6-8  and   $_{6-9}$   show the new calculation.  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}\;=\;\mathbf{Total}\;\mathbf{Moment}\div\mathbf{Total}\;\mathbf{weight}}\\ {\;=\;3{,}400\;\mathrm{in}{\cdot}\mathbf{lb}\div495\;\mathrm{lb}}\\ {\;=\;6.9"\;(6.87\;\mathrm{rounded}\;\mathrm{to}\;\mathrm{tens})}\end{array}}
$$  

In  Figure 6-8,  the CG is  $6.9"$   to the right of the plank’s center.  Even though the arm is not the same number, in  Figure 6-6  the  CG is also  $6.9"$   to the right of center (CG location of 106.9  with the center being 100). Because both problems are the  same in these two figures, except for the datum location, the  CG must be the same.  

The definition for CG states that it is the point about which  all the moments are equal. We can prove that the CG for  the object in  Figure 6-8  is correct by showing that the total  moments on either side of this point are equal. Using 6.87 as  the CG location for slightly greater accuracy, instead of the  rounded off 6.9 number, the moments to the left of the CG are  shown in  Figure 6-10.  The moments to the right of the CG,  shown in  Figure 6-8,  would be as indicated in  Figure 6-11. Disregarding the slightly different decimal value, the moment  in both previous calculations is 10,651 in-lb. Showing that  the moments are equal is a good way of proving that the CG  has been properly calculated.  

# Weight and Balance Data  

Before an aircraft can be properly weighed and its EWCG  computed, certain information must be known. This  information is furnished by the FAA to anyone for every  certificated aircraft in the TCDS or Aircraft Specifications.  When the design of an aircraft is approved by the FAA, an  Approved Type Certificate and TCDS are issued. The TCDS  

![](images/103fd584dff0df7fb1d07ea39212c1600ed4e2e5cb224951d4b094b89011a581.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.   Center of gravity determined by two suspension points.  

includes all the pertinent specifications for the aircraft, and  at each annual or 100-hour inspection, it is the responsibility  of the inspecting mechanic or repairman to ensure that the  aircraft adheres to them.  

# Manufacturer-Furnished Information  

When an aircraft is initially certificated, its empty weight  and EWCG are determined and recorded in the weight and  balance record, such as the one in  Figure 6-12.  An equipment  list is furnished with the aircraft that specifies all the required  equipment and all equipment approved for installation in the  aircraft. The weight and arm of each item is included on the  

![](images/2894e80778fc9d81214704e51c947927db675a907506c89f726dd1d831507c24.jpg)

list, and all equipment installed when the aircraft left the  factory is checked. When an aircraft mechanic or repairman  adds or removes any item on the equipment list, they must  change the weight and balance record to indicate the new  empty weight and EWCG, and the equipment list is revised  to show what is installed.  

Figure 6-13  is an excerpt from a comprehensive equipment  list that includes all the items of equipment approved for this  model of aircraft. The Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) or  Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) for each individual aircraft  includes an aircraft specific equipment list of the items  from this master list. When any item is added to or removed  from the aircraft, its weight and arm are determined in the  equipment list and used to update the weight and balance  record. The POH/AFM also contains CG moment envelopes  and loading graphs.  

Figures 6-14  through  6-16  shows a TCDS for a Piper twin- engine airplane known as the Seneca (PA-34-200). The  main headings for the information contained in a TCDS  are included, but much of the information contained under  these headings has been removed if it did not directly pertain  to weight and balance. Information on only one model of  Seneca is shown, because to show all the different models  would make the document excessively long. The portion of  the TCDS that has the most direct application to weight and  balance is highlighted in yellow.  

Some of the important weight and balance information found  in a TCDS is as follows:

# Weight and Balance Equipment  

# Scales  

Weighing GA aircraft, helicopters, turboprops, corporate  jets, UAV/UAS, or transport category airliners can be  accomplished in two ways: top of jack load cells and platform  scales. Equipment selection is dependent on the operator's  needs and or equipment currently on hand, as well as the  airframe manufacturer's recommendations. Top of jack load  cells, as the name implies, can be used on top of the current  wing jacks or can be used under axle for larger jets. Platforms  are very useful for small shops that do not have jacks for  every type of aircraft.  

![Figure 6-11.   Moments to the right of the center of gravity. ](images/4b3641e0fcf61370e6c6a947a28eada2a8116ed07f9f294f65d2dbd16e8e8917.jpg)  

![Figure 6-12.   Typical weight and balance data for 14 CFR part 23 airplane. ](images/e669bf178e0deb7194903996edd938026b7fd2cb8d17cb8f2e7353789f86c9f3.jpg)  

operations with computer-based indication and cable-based  wired digital indication. Mechanical or analog meter scales  have mostly been replaced with the new wireless systems and  or digital indicators. These systems and indicators are very  accurate and easy to use, making the weighing job faster to  accomplish and providing higher quality in readings.  

Platforms are available in many weight ranges and sizes.  These systems either use ramps or the aircraft can be jacked  and lowered onto the platforms during regular maintenance.  Platforms are easy to use and are a choice for many shops  that do not have jacks for the many types of aircraft to be  serviced. The limiting factors for platforms are the weight  range and the tire size, some aircraft have large tires and the  platform may be too small for the specific aircraft tire. It is  important to always use the right size scale and platform for  the aircraft type and weighing job required.  

The platform scale sits on the hangar floor in a level  condition. Ramps and a tug are used to position the airplane  tire on top of the platform and centered. Built into the  platform is an electronic load cell(s) that sense the weight  being applied to it, which generates a corresponding electrical  signal. Inside the load cell is an electronic strain gauge that  measures a proportional change in electrical resistance as  the weight being applied to it increases. An electrical cable  or wireless signal runs from the platform scale to a display  unit, computer, or tablet, which interprets the resistance  change of the load cell and equates it to a specific number of  pounds. A digital readout on the display shows the weight. In  Figure 6-17,  a small Piper is being weighed using wireless  platform scales that incorporate electronic load cells.  

In  Figure 6-18,  a Cessna 182 airplane is being weighed with  portable electronic platform scales. If an aircraft is weighed  on platform scales, the only way to level the aircraft is to  deflate tires and landing gear struts accordingly. This type of  scale is easy to transport and can be powered by household  current or by a battery contained in the display unit.  

The display unit for the standard wired platform scales is very  easy to use.  [Figure 6-19]  Turn on the power and the unit  runs through the software and displays the scales in a total  mode. Pressing on the ZERO KEY (blue key not the number  key) will ZERO the channels. Once completed, the unit will  read -0- and the scale is ready to use. Select the channels by  number and pressing the PRINT/SELECT KEY. All channels  can be returned to TOTAL MODE by entering the number 4  TOTAL followed by the PRINT/SELECT KEY .  If all three  scale switches are turned on at the same time, the total weight  of the airplane is displayed.  

The second type of aircraft scale is a top of jack, cell-based  scale, where each jack point receives a cell-based transducer  on the top of the jack. It is very easy to use and level the  aircraft during the weighing operation. The system is easy  to transport, light weight, and simple to set up. The operator  must have a jack capable of receiving and mounting the cell.  Cells come in many weight ranges and are dependent on the  weight required per point to accomplish the weighing and  receiving the actual jack point type.  

The top of the load cell has a concave shape that matches up  with the jack pad on the aircraft, with the load cell absorbing  all the weight of the aircraft at each jacking point. Each load  cell either has an electrical cable attached to it or is wireless,  which connects to the display unit or computer read out that  shows the weight transmitted to each load cell. An important  advantage of weighing an aircraft this way is that it allows  the technician to level the aircraft easily. When an aircraft  

# Comprehensive Equipment List  

This is a comprehensive list of all Cessna equipment that is available for the Model 182S airplane. It should not be confused with the airplane-specific equipment list. An  airplane-specific list is provided with each individual airplane at delivery and is typically inserted at the rear of this Pilot’s Operating Handbook. The following comprehensive  equipment list and the airplane-specific list have a similar order of listing.  

The comprehensive equipment list provides the following information in column form:  

In the  Item No  column, each item is assigned a coded number. The first two digits of the code represent the assignment of item within the ATA iSpec 2200 breakdown  (Chapter 11 for Placards, Chapter 21 for Air Conditioning, Chapter 77 for Engine Indicating, etc.). These assignments also correspond to the Maintenance Manual chapter  breakdown for the airplane. After the first two digits (and hyphen), items receive a unique sequence number (01, 02, 03, etc...). After the sequence number (and hyphen),  a suffix letter is assigned to identify equipment as a required item, a standard item or an optional item. Suffix letters are as follows:  

$-\mathsf{R}=$   required items or equipment for FAA certification  $-\mathbb{S}=$   standard equipment items  $-0=$   optional equipment items replacing required or standard items  $\multimap$   optional equipment items which are in addition to required or standard items  

In the  Equipment List Description  column, each item is assigned a descriptive name to help identify its function. In the  Ref Drawing  column, a drawing number is provided which corresponds to the item. Note If additional equipment is to be installed, it must be done in accordance with the reference drawing, service bulletin or a separate FAA approval. In the  Wt Lbs  and  Arm Ins  columns, information is provided on the weight (in pounds) and arm (in inches) of the equipment item.  

# Notes  

Unless otherwise indicated, true values (not net change values) for the weight and arm are shown. Positive arms are distances aft of the airplane datum; negative  arms are distances forward of the datum.  

Asterisks (\*) in the weight and arm column indicate complete assembly installations. Some major components of the assembly are listed on the lines immediately  following. The sum of these major components does not necessarily equal the complete assembly installation.

is weighed using load cells on jacks, leveling the aircraft is  done by adjusting the height with the jacks and checking the  level at the level point.  Figure 6-20  shows a Gulfstream jet  on jacks with the load cells in place.  

Always follow the aircraft manufacturer’s weighing and  leveling procedures and processes. All aircraft need to be  in a flight level attitude when they are weighed unless the  manufacturer’s manual specifically allows it or has a formula  in the manual to use accordingly.  

# Spirit Level  

Before an aircraft can be weighed and reliable readings  obtained, it must be in a level flight attitude. One method that  can be used to check for a level condition is to use a spirit  level, sometimes thought of as a carpenter’s level, by placing  it on or against a specified place on the aircraft. Spirit levels  consist of a vial full of liquid, except for a small air bubble.  When the air bubble is centered between the two black lines,  a level condition is indicated.  

In  Figure 6-21,  a spirit level is being used on a Mooney M20  to check for a flight level attitude. By looking in the TCDS,  it is determined that the leveling means is two screws on  the left side of the airplane fuselage, in line with the trailing  edge of the wing.  

# Plumb Bob  

A plumb bob is a heavy metal object, cylinder or cone shape,  with a sharp point at one end and a string attached to the  other end. If the string is attached to a given point on an  aircraft, and the plumb bob can hang down so the tip just  touches the ground, the point where the tip touches will be  perpendicular to where the string is attached. An example  of the use of a plumb bob would be measuring the distance  from an aircraft’s datum to the center of the main landing  gear axle. If the leading edge of the wing was the datum, a  plumb bob could be dropped from the leading edge and a

chalk mark made on the hangar floor. The plumb bob could  also be dropped from the center of the axle on the main  landing gear, and a chalk mark made on the floor. With a tape  measure, the distance between the two chalk marks could be  determined, and the arm for the main landing gear would be  known. Plumb bobs can also be used to level an aircraft, as  described in the Helicopter Weight and Balance section of  this chapter.  Figure 6-22  shows a plumb bob being dropped  from the leading edge of an aircraft wing.  

# Hydrometer  

When an aircraft is weighed with full fuel in the tanks, the  weight of the fuel must be accounted for by mathematically  subtracting it from the scale readings. To subtract it, its  weight, arm, and moment must be known. Although the  standard weight for aviation gasoline (Avgas) is   $6.0\;1\mathrm{b/cal}$  and jet fuel is   $6.7\ \mathrm{lb/gapal}$  , these values are not exact for all  conditions. On a hot day versus a cold day, these values can  vary dramatically. On a hot summer day in the state of Florida,  Avgas checked with a hydrometer typically weighs between  5.85 and   ${5.9\;\mathrm{lb/gapal}}$  . If 100 gallons of fuel were involved in  

![](images/b9a3398b09225eb6b6e9f7dd832f580d352ffbb3b637a3ae66389a64bbbcbb4d.jpg)  
Figure 6-19.   M2000 platform scale digital indicator.  

a calculation, using the actual weight versus the standard  weight would make a difference of 10 to   $15\,\mathrm{lb}$  .  

When an aircraft is weighed with fuel in the tanks, the weight  of fuel per gallon should be checked with a hydrometer. A  hydrometer consists of a weighted glass tube that is sealed  with a graduated set of markings on the side of the tube.  The graduated markings and their corresponding number  values represent units of pounds per gallon   $\mathrm{(lb/gal)}$  . When  placed in a flask with fuel in it, the glass tube floats at a  level dependent on the density of the fuel. Where the fuel  intersects the markings on the side of the tube indicates the  pounds per gallon.  

# Preparing an Aircraft for Weighing  

Weighing an aircraft is a very important and exacting phase  of aircraft maintenance and must be carried out with accuracy  and good workmanship. Thoughtful preparation saves time  and prevents mistakes. The aircraft should be weighed inside  a hangar where wind cannot blow over the surface and cause  fluctuating or false scale readings. The aircraft should be  clean inside and out, with special attention paid to the bilge  area to be sure no water or debris is trapped. The outside of  the aircraft should be as free as possible of all mud and dirt.  

To begin, assemble all the necessary equipment, such as:  

1.	 Scales, hoisting equipment, jacks, and leveling  equipment. 2.	 Blocks, chocks, or sandbags for holding the airplane  

![](images/65900b45d288d003b853a791b7bc8607c438b2ca4d3d5a8693d1a49d408db268.jpg)

on the scales.  

3.	 Straightedge, spirit level, plumb bobs, chalk line, and  a measuring tape.  

4.	 Applicable Aircraft Specifications and weight and  balance computation forms.  

# Fuel System  

When weighing an aircraft to determine its empty weight,  only the weight of residual (unusable) fuel should be  included. To ensure that only residual fuel is accounted for,  the aircraft should be weighed in one of the following three  conditions.  

1. 	 Weigh the aircraft with absolutely no fuel in the  aircraft tanks or fuel lines. If an aircraft is weighed in  this condition, the technician can mathematically add  the proper amount of residual fuel to the aircraft and  account for its arm and moment. The proper amount  of fuel can be determined by looking in the aircraft’s  TCDS.  

2. 	 Drain fuel from the tanks in the manner specified  by the aircraft manufacturer. If there are no specific  instructions, drain the fuel until the fuel quantity  gauges read empty and until fuel stops draining from  the tanks. The aircraft attitude may be a consideration  when draining the fuel tanks and the maintenance  manual should be consulted. In this case, the unusable  fuel will remain in the lines and system, and its  weight and arm can be determined by reference to the  aircraft’s TCDS.  

3. 	 Weigh the aircraft with the fuel tanks completely  full. If an aircraft is weighed in this condition, the  technician can mathematically subtract the weight of  usable fuel and account for its arm and moment. If  the weight of the fuel is in question, a hydrometer can  

![](images/fa212a66b1d96e7c4f8ff966b0debeeb2e4ccc5545f2054434a495e3766326a7.jpg)

Figure 6-22.   Plumb bob dropped from a wing leading edge.  

also be used to determine the weight of each gallon of  fuel, while the Aircraft Specifications or TCDS can  be used to identify the fuel capacity of the aircraft. If  an aircraft is to be weighed with load cells attached to  jacks, the technician should check both the load cell  instruction manual and aircraft maintenance manual  to make sure it is permissible to jack the aircraft with  the fuel tanks full as this may add additional stress to  the aircraft structure.  

Never weigh an aircraft with fuel tanks partially full, because  it will be impossible to determine exactly how much fuel to  account for.  

# Oil System  

The empty weight for older aircraft certificated under the  Civil Air Regulations (CAR) part 3 does not include the  engine lubricating oil. The oil must be drained before the  aircraft is weighed, or its weight must be subtracted from the  scale readings to determine the empty weight.  

To weigh an aircraft that does not include the engine  lubricating oil as part of the empty weight, place it in level  flight attitude, then open the drain valves and allow all the  oil that is able, to drain out. Any remaining is undrainable  oil and is part of the empty weight.  

If it is impractical to drain the oil, the reservoir can be filled  to the specified level and the weight of the oil computed at 7.5  lb/gal. Then its weight and moment are subtracted from the  weight and moment of the aircraft as weighed. The amount  and arm of the undrainable oil are found in NOTE 1 of the  TCDS, and this must be added to the empty weight.  

For aircraft certificated since 1978 under 14 CFR parts 23  and 25, full engine oil is typically included in an aircraft’s  empty weight. This can be confirmed by looking at the TCDS.  If full oil is to be included, the oil level needs to be checked  and the oil system serviced if it is less than full.  

# Miscellaneous Fluids  

The hydraulic fluid reservoir and all other reservoirs  containing fluids required for normal operation of the aircraft  should be full. Fluids not considered to be part of the empty  weight of the aircraft are potable (drinkable) water, lavatory  precharge water, and water for injection into the engines.  

# Flight Controls  

The position of such items as spoilers, slats, flaps, and  helicopter rotor systems is an important factor when weighing  an aircraft. Always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions  for the proper position of these items.  

# Other Considerations  

Inspect the aircraft to see that all items included in the  certificated empty weight are installed in the proper location.  Remove items that are not regularly carried in flight. Also,  look in the baggage compartments to make sure they are  empty. Replace all inspection plates, oil and fuel tank caps,  junction box covers, cowling, doors, emergency exits, and  other parts that have been removed during maintenance.  All doors, windows, and sliding canopies should be in the  normal flight position. Remove excessive dirt, oil, grease,  and moisture from the aircraft.  

Some aircraft are not weighed with the wheels on the scales,  but are weighed with the scales placed either at the jacking  points or at special weighing points. Regardless of what  provisions are made for placing the aircraft on the scales  or jacks, be careful to prevent it from falling or rolling off,  thereby damaging the aircraft and equipment. When weighing  an aircraft with the wheels placed on the scales, release the  brakes to reduce the possibility of incorrect readings caused  by side loads on the scales.  

All aircraft have leveling points or lugs, and care must be  taken to level the aircraft, especially along the longitudinal  axis. With light, fixed-wing airplanes, the lateral level is  not as critical as it is with heavier airplanes. However, a  reasonable effort should be made to level the light airplanes  along the lateral axis. Helicopters must be level longitudinally  and laterally when they are weighed. Accuracy in leveling all  aircraft longitudinally cannot be overemphasized.  

# Weighing Points  

When an aircraft is being weighed, the arms must be known  for the points where the weight of the aircraft is being  transferred to the scales. If a tricycle gear small airplane has  its three wheels sitting on floor scales, the weight transfer  to each scale happens through the center of the axle for each  wheel. If an airplane is weighed while it is on jacks, the  weight transfer happens through the center of the jack pad.  For a helicopter with skids for landing gear, determining the  arm for the weighing points can be difficult if the skids are  sitting directly on floor scales. The problem is that the skid  is in contact with the entire top portion of the scale, and it  is impossible to know exactly where the center of weight  transfer is occurring. In such a case, place a piece of pipe  between the skid and the scale, and the center of the pipe will  now be the known point of weight transfer.  

The arm for each of the weighing points is the distance from  the center of the weight transfer point to the aircraft’s datum.  If the arms are not known, based on previous weighing of the  aircraft or some other source of data, they must be measured  when the aircraft is weighed. This involves dropping a  plumb bob from the center of each weighing point and from  the aircraft datum, and putting a chalk mark on the hangar  floor representing each point. The perpendicular distance  between the datum and each of the weighing points can then  be measured. In  Figure 6-23,  the distance from the nosewheel  centerline to the datum is being measured on an airplane.  The nosewheel sitting on an electronic scale can be seen in  the background.  

# Jacking the Aircraft  

Aircraft are often weighed by rolling them onto ramps in  which load cells are embedded. This eliminates the problems  associated with jacking the aircraft off the ground. However,  many aircraft are weighed by jacking the aircraft up and then  lowering them onto scales or load cells. Extra care must be  used when raising an aircraft on jacks for weighing. If the  aircraft has spring steel landing gear and it is jacked at the  wheel, the landing gear will slide inward as the weight is  taken off the tire. Care must be taken to prevent the jack  from tipping over. For some aircraft, stress panels or plates  must be installed before they are raised with wing jacks to  distribute the weight over the jack pad. Be sure to follow  the recommendations of the aircraft manufacturer in detail  anytime an aircraft is jacked. When using two wing jacks,  take special care to raise them simultaneously, so the aircraft  does not slip off the jacks. As the jacks are raised, keep the  safety collars screwed down against the jack cylinder to  prevent the aircraft from tilting if one of the jacks should  lose hydraulic pressure.  

# Leveling the Aircraft  

When an aircraft is weighed, it must be in its level flight  attitude so that all the components are at the correct distance  from the datum. This attitude is determined by information in  the TCDS. Some aircraft require a plumb line to be dropped  from a specified location so that the point of the weight, the  bob, hangs directly above an identifiable point. Others specify  that a spirit level be placed across two leveling lugs (special  screws on the outside of the fuselage). Other aircraft call for a  spirit level to be placed on the upper door sill. Lateral level is  not specified for all light aircraft, but provisions are normally  made on helicopters for determining both longitudinal  and lateral level. This may be done by built-in leveling  indicators or by a plumb bob that shows the conditions of  both longitudinal and lateral level. The actual adjustments  to level the aircraft using load cells are made with the jacks.  When weighing from the wheels, leveling is normally done  by adjusting the air pressure in the nosewheel shock strut.  

# Safety Considerations  

Special precautions must be taken when raising an aircraft  on jacks.  

1. 	 Stress plates must be installed under the jack pads if  the manufacturer specifies them. 2. 	 If anyone is required to be in the aircraft while it is  being jacked, there must be no movement. 3. 	 The jacks must be straight under the jack pads before  beginning to raise the aircraft. 4. 	 All jacks must be raised simultaneously and safety  devices placed against the jack cylinder to prevent the  aircraft from tipping if any jack should lose pressure.  Not all jacks have screw-down collars, some use drop  pins or friction locks.  

# CG Range  

The CG range for an aircraft is the limits within which the  aircraft must balance. It is identified as a range and considered  an arm extending from the forward most limit to the aft most  limit usually expressed in inches. In the TCDS for the Piper  Seneca airplane, shown earlier in this chapter, the range is  given in  Figure 6-24.  

Because the Piper Seneca is a retractable gear airplane, the  specifications identify that the range applies when the landing  gear is extended, and that the airplane’s total moment is  decreased by 32 when the gear retracts. To know how much  the CG changes when the gear is retracted, the moment of  32 in-lb would need to be divided by the loaded weight of  the airplane. For example, if the airplane weighed 3,500 lb,  the CG would move forward  $0.009"$     $(32\div3{,}500)$  .  

Based on the numbers given, up to a loaded weight of  2,780 lb, the forward CG limit is  $+80.7"$   and the aft CG limit  is  $+94.6"$  . As the loaded weight of the airplane increases to  3,400 lb, and eventually to the maximum of 4,000 lb, the  forward CG limit moves aft. In other words, as the loaded  weight of the airplane increases, the CG range gets smaller.  

The range gets smaller because of the forward limit moving  back, while the aft limit stays in the same place.  

The data sheet identifies that there is a straight-line variation  between the points given. The points being referred to are  the forward and aft CG limits. From a weight of  $2{,}780\,1\mathrm{b}$   to  a weight of 3,400 lb, the forward limit moves from  $+80.7"$  to   $+82.0"$  , and if plotted on a graph, that change would  form a straight line. From 3,400 lb to 4,000 lb, the forward  limit moves from   $+82$   to   $+86.4"$  , again forming a straight  line. Plotted on a graph, the CG limits would look like  Figure 6-25.  When graphically plotted, the CG limits form  what is known as the CG envelope.  

In  Figure 6-25,  the red line represents the forward limit up  to a weight of 2,780 lb. The blue and green lines represent  the straight-line variation that occurs for the forward limit  as the weight increases up to a maximum of 4,000 lb. The  yellow line represents the maximum weight for the airplane,  and the purple line represents the aft limit.  

# Empty Weight Center of Gravity (EWCG) Range  

For some aircraft, a CG range is given for the aircraft in the  empty weight condition in the TCDS. This practice is not very  common with airplanes, but is often done for helicopters. This  range would only be listed for an airplane if the fuel tanks,  seats, and baggage compartments are so located that changes  in the fuel or occupant load have a very limited effect on the  balance of the aircraft. If the EWCG of an aircraft falls within  the EWCG limits, it is impossible to legally load the aircraft  so that its loaded CG falls outside of its allowable range. If the  TCDS lists an EWCG range and, after a repair or alteration  is completed, the EWCG falls within this range, then there is  no need to compute a fore and aft check for adverse loading.  But if the TCDS lists the EWCG range as “None” (and most  of them do), a check must be made to determine whether it  is possible by any combination of legal loading to cause the  

![](images/7e74c23e939ab55a18a863364aed63f127f7499f2c780397614924dfb3996d70.jpg)  
Figure 6-23.   Measuring the nosewheel arm on an airplane.  

# Operating CG Range  

All aircraft have CG limits identified for the operational  condition, with the aircraft loaded and ready for flight. If an  aircraft can operate in more than one category, such as normal  and utility, more than one set of limits might be listed. As  shown earlier for the Piper Seneca airplane, the limits can  change as the weight of the aircraft increases. To legally fly,  the CG for the aircraft must fall within the CG limits.  

# Standard Weights Used for Aircraft Weight and  Balance  

Unless the specific weight for an item is known, the standard  weights used in aircraft weight and balance are as follows:  

•	 Avgas 	 	 	 	             $6\,\mathrm{lb/cal}$  •	 Turbine fuel 	 	 	          $6.7\,\mathrm{lb/cal}$  •	 Lubricating oil 	 	 	          $7.5\,\mathrm{lb/cal}$  •	 Water 	 	 	 	        $8.35\,\mathrm{1b/cal}$  •	 Crew and passengers	          170 lb per person  

# Example Weighing of an Airplane  

In  Figure 6-26,  a tricycle gear airplane is being weighed by  using three floor scales. The specifications on the airplane  and the weighing specific data are shown in  Figure 6-27.  

By analyzing the data identified for the airplane being weighed  in  Figure 6-26,  the following information is determined.  

•	 Because the airplane was weighed with the fuel tanks  full, the full weight of the fuel must be subtracted and  the unusable fuel added back in. The weight of the fuel  being subtracted is based on the pounds per gallon  determined by the hydrometer check   $(5.9\,\mathrm{1b/bal})$  . •	 Because wheel chocks are used to keep the airplane  from rolling off the scales, their weight must be  subtracted from the scale readings as tare weight.  •	 Because the main wheel centerline is   $70"$   behind the  datum, its arm is a  $+70"$  . •	 The arm for the nosewheel is the difference between  the wheelbase (100") and the distance from the datum  to the main wheel centerline (70"). Therefore, the arm  for the nosewheel is  $-30"$  .  

To calculate the airplane’s empty weight and EWCG, a six- column chart is used.  Figure 6-28  shows the calculation for  the airplane in  Figure 6-26.  

Based on the calculation shown in the chart, the CG is at   $+50.1"$  , which means it is 50.1" aft of the datum. This places  

![](images/472fbdd9f3e061e347e40f4dac9f39a841df98056da847b8848b104a4ca1d5e3.jpg)  

the CG forward of the main landing gear, which must be the  case for a tricycle gear airplane. This number is the result of  dividing the total moment of 66,698 in-lb by the total weight  of 1,331.5 lb.  

# EWCG Formulas  

The EWCG can be quickly calculated by using the following  formulas. There are four possible conditions and formulas  that relate the location of the CG to the datum. Notice that  the formula for each condition first determines the moment  of the nose  $\frac{\mathrm{~\boldmath~F~}\!\times\!\mathrm{~\boldmath~L~}}{\mathrm{~\boldmath~W~}}$  wheel or tail  $\frac{\mathbb{R}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}$  wheel and then divides it  by the total weight of the airplane. The arm is then added  to or subtracted from the distance between the main wheels  and the datum (distance D).  

Formula 1	 Nosewheel airplanes with datum forward of 	 	 the main wheels.  

$$
\mathrm{CG}\ =\ \mathrm{D}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{F}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}\right)
$$  

Formula 2 	 Nosewheel airplanes with the datum aft of 	 	 the main wheels.  

$$
\mathrm{CG}\ =\ -\left(\mathrm{D}+\frac{\mathrm{F}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}\right)
$$  

Formula 3 	 Tail wheel airplanes with the datum forward 	 	 of the main wheels.  

$$
\mathrm{CG}\ =\ \mathrm{D}+\left(\ \frac{\mathrm{R}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}\right)
$$  

Formula 4 	 Tail wheel airplanes with the datum aft of 	 	 the main wheels.  

$$
\mathrm{C}\mathrm{G}\ =\ -\,\mathrm{D}+\left(\frac{\mathrm{R}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}\right)
$$  

# Datum Forward of the Airplane–Nosewheel Landing  Gear  

The datum of the airplane in  Figure 6-29  is   $100"$   forward  of the leading edge of the wing root, or  $128"$   forward of the  

![](images/1821b7e4f507abb6ed883dc269fde92d985b6595d8537e111272fda8aefaadf8.jpg)

main-wheel weighing points. This is distance (D). The weight  of the nosewheel (F) is   $340~1\mathfrak{b}$  , and the distance between  main wheels and nosewheel (L) is  $78"$  . The total weight of  the airplane (W) is 2,006 lb.  

The location of the CG may be determined by using this  formula:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{{\mathrm{CG}}\;=\;\mathrm{D}-\left(\,{\frac{\mathrm{F}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}}\right)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\,}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\,=\;128-\left(\,{\frac{\,340\times\,78\,}{2,006}}\,\right)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\,}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\,=\,114.8}\end{array}}
$$  

The CG is   $114.8"$   aft of the datum. This is  $13.2"$   forward of  the main-wheel weighing points, which proves the location  of the datum has no effect on the location of the CG so long  as all measurements are made from the same location.  

# Datum Aft of the Main Wheels–Nosewheel Landing  Gear  

The datum of some aircraft may be located aft of the main  wheels. The airplane in this example is the same one just  discussed, but the datum is at the intersection of the trailing  edge of the wing with the fuselage. The distance (D) between  the datum of the airplane in  Figure   $_{6-30}$   and the main-wheel  weighing points is  $75"$  , the weight of the nosewheel (F) is 340  lb, and the distance between main wheels and nosewheel (L)  is   $78"$  . The total net weight of the airplane (W) is 2,006 lb. The location of the CG may be determined by using this  formula:  

The CG location is a negative value, which means it is 88.2"  forward of the datum. This places it  $13.2"$   forward of the main  wheels, the same location as it was when it was measured  from other datum locations.  

# Location of Datum  

It makes no difference where the datum is located if all  measurements are made from the same location.

# Landing Gear  

Locating the CG of a tail wheel airplane is done in the  same way as locating it for a nosewheel airplane except the  formulas use   $\frac{\mathbb{R}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathbb{W}}$   rather than   $\frac{\mathrm{~\boldmath~F~}\!\times\!\mathrm{~\boldmath~L~}}{\mathrm{~\boldmath~W~}}$  .  

The distance (D) between the datum of the airplane in  Figure  $_{6-3I}$    and the main-gear weighing points is   $7.5"$  , the  weight of the tail wheel (R) is   $67~1\mathbf{b}$  , and the distance (L)  between the main-wheel and the tail wheel weighing points  is   $222"$  . The total weight of the airplane (W) is   $^{1,218\;\mathrm{lb}}$  .  Determine the CG by using this formula:

$$  

The CG is 19.7 inches behind the datum.  

# Datum Aft of the Main Wheels–Tail Wheel Landing  Gear  

The datum of the airplane in  Figure 6-32  is located at the  intersection of the wing root trailing edge and the fuselage.  This places the arm of the main gear (D) at   $-80"$  . The net  weight of the tail wheel (R) is  $67~1\mathbf{b}$  , the distance between  the main wheels and the tail wheel (L) is   $222"$  , and the total  net weight (W) of the airplane is 1,218 lb.  

Since the datum is aft of the main wheels, use the formula:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\operatorname{CG}\ =\ -\operatorname{D}+\left({\frac{\operatorname{R}\times\operatorname{L}}{\operatorname{W}}}\right)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\quad}\\ &{\qquad\qquad=\ -\ 80+\left({\frac{67\times222}{1,218}}\right)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\quad}\\ &{\qquad\qquad=\ -67.8}\end{array}}
$$  

The CG is   $67.8"$   forward of the datum, or   $12.2"$   aft of the  main-gear weighing points. The CG is in the same location  relative to the main wheels, regardless of where the datum  is located.  

# Loading an Aircraft for Flight  

The ultimate test of whether there is a problem with an  airplane’s weight and balance is when it is loaded and ready  to fly. The only real importance of an airplane’s empty weight  and EWCG is how it affects the loaded weight and balance  of the airplane, since an airplane does not fly when it is  empty. The pilot-in-command is responsible for the weight  and balance of the loaded airplane, and they make the final  decision on whether the airplane is safe to fly.  

# Example Loading of an Airplane  

As an example of an airplane being loaded for flight, the  Piper Seneca twin will be used. The TCDS for this airplane  was shown earlier in this chapter, and its CG range and CG  envelope were also shown.  

The information from the TCDS that pertains to this example  loading is shown in  Figure 6-33.  

![](images/190bd81027e9329f2e20cbc9f4da8690cf619879376a174f7a221626cdfe68f9.jpg)  
Figure 6-29.   The datum is   $\mathit{l00"}$   forward of the wing root leading  edge.  

For the example loading of the airplane, the following  information applies:  

•	 Airplane Serial Number: 	 34-7250816 •	 Airplane Empty Weight: 	 2,650 lb •	 Airplane EWCG: 	 	  $+86.8"$  

For today’s flight, the following useful load items are  included:  

•	 1 pilot at 180 lb at an arm of  $+85.5"$  •	 1 passenger at 160 lb at an arm of  $+118.1$  " •	 1 passenger at 210 lb at an arm of  $+118.1$  " •	 1 passenger at 190 lb at an arm of  $+118.1$  " •	 1 passenger at 205 lb at an arm of  $+155.7"$  •	 50 lb of baggage at an arm of  $+22.5^{\prime}$  " •	 100 lb of baggage at an arm of  $+178.7^{\prime}$  " •	 80 gal of fuel at an arm of  $+93.6^{\prime}$  

To calculate the loaded weight and CG of this airplane, a  four-column chart is used in  Figure 6-34.  

Based on the information in the TCDS, the maximum takeoff  weight of this airplane is 4,200 lb and the aft-most CG limit  

![](images/97ffaf945d99bb582c77dd7a48e965b5069fd64c56974de13aafb9e207ecbebd.jpg)  
Figure 6-30.   The datum is aft of the main wheels at the wing  trailing edge.  

is   $+94.6"$  . The loaded airplane in  Figure   $_{6-34}$   is   $25~1\mathbf{b}$   too  heavy, and the CG is   $1.82"$   too far aft. To make the airplane  safe to fly, the load needs to be reduced by   $25~1\mathsf{b}$   and some  of the load needs to be shifted forward. For example, the  baggage can be reduced by  $25\,1{\mathfrak{b}}$  , and a full   $100\,1\mathrm{b}$   of it can  be placed in the more forward compartment. One passenger  can be moved to the forward seat next to the pilot, and the  aft-most passenger can then be moved forward.  

With the changes made, the loaded weight is now at the  maximum allowable of 4,200 lb, and the CG has moved  forward 4.42".  [Figure 6-35]  The airplane is now safe to fly.  

# Adverse-Loaded CG Checks  

Many modern aircraft have multiple rows of seats and often  more than one baggage compartment. After any repair or  alteration that changes the weight and balance, the A&P  mechanic or repairman must ensure that no legal condition of  loading can move the CG outside of its allowable limits. To  determine this, adverse-loaded CG checks must be performed  and the results noted in the weight and balance revision sheet.  

During a forward adverse-loaded CG check, all useful load  items in front of the forward CG limit are loaded and all useful  load items behind the forward CG limit are left empty. So,  if there are two seats and a baggage compartment located in  front of the forward CG limit, two people weighing 170 lb  each are seated and the maximum allowable baggage is  placed in the baggage compartment. Any seat or baggage  compartment located behind the forward CG limit is left  empty. If the fuel is located behind the forward CG limit,  minimum fuel will be shown in the tank. Minimum fuel is  calculated by dividing the engine’s METO hp by 2.  

During an aft adverse-loaded CG check, all useful load items  behind the aft CG limit are loaded and all useful load items  in front of the aft CG limit are left empty. Even though the  pilot’s seat will be in front of the aft CG limit, the pilot’s seat  cannot be left empty. If the fuel tank is located forward of  the aft CG limit, minimum fuel will be shown.  

# Example Forward & Aft Adverse-Loaded CG Checks  

Using the stick airplane in  Figure   $_{6-36}$   as an example,  adverse forward and aft CG checks are calculated. Some  of the data for the airplane is shown in  Figure 6-36 , such  as seat, baggage, and fuel information. The CG limits are  shown, with arrows pointing in the direction where maximum  and minimum weights are loaded. On the forward check,  any useful load item located in front of   $89"$   is loaded, and  anything behind that location is left empty. On the aft check,  maximum weight is added behind 99" and minimum weight  in front of that location. For either of the checks, if fuel is not  located in a maximum weight location, minimum fuel must

be accounted for. Notice that the front seats show a location  of   $82"$   to  $88"$  , meaning they are adjustable fore and aft. In a  forward check, the pilot’s seat will be shown at   $82"$  , and in  the aft check it will be at   $88"$  . Additional specifications for  the airplane shown in  Figure 6-36  are as follows:  

•	 Airplane empty weight: 	 1,850 lb •	 EWCG: 	 	 	  $+92.45"$  •	 CG limits: 	 	  $+89"$   to  $+99$  " •	 Maximum weight: 	 	 3,200 lb •	 Fuel capacity: 	 	 45 gal at  $+95"$     	 	 	 (44 usable) 	 	 	 40 gal at  $+102"$  	 	 	 (39 usable)  

In evaluating the two extreme condition checks, the following  key points should be recognized.  [Figure 6-37]  

•	 The total arm is the airplane CG and is found by  dividing the total moment by the total weight. •	 For the forward check, the only thing loaded behind  the forward limit was minimum fuel. •	 For the forward check, the pilot and passenger seats  were shown at the forward position of 82".  

![](images/2952e33034c2bb30cf5a74114bc5026c01b57747797074de1814f3a02e9f8011.jpg)  

•	 For the forward check, the CG was within limits, so  the airplane could be flown this way. •	 For the aft check, the only thing loaded in front of the  aft limit was the pilot, at an arm of   $88"$  . •	 For the aft check, the fuel tank at  $102"$   was filled, which  more than accounted for the required minimum fuel. •	 For the aft check, the CG was out of limits by   $0.6"$  ,  so the airplane should not be flown this way.  

# Equipment Change & Aircraft Alteration  

When the equipment in an aircraft is changed, such as the  installation of a new radar system or ground proximity  

![](images/7f48b09d011bc116dcd43db2cdfd438497e5cbc5adca2a84f6203235d88debbd.jpg)  

warning system, or the removal of a radio or seat, the weight  and balance of an aircraft changes. An alteration performed  on an aircraft, such as a cargo door being installed or a  reinforcing plate being attached to the spar of a wing, also  changes the weight and balance of an aircraft. Any time the  equipment is changed or an alteration is performed, the new  empty weight and EWCG must be determined. This can be  accomplished by placing the aircraft on scales and weighing  it, or by mathematically calculating the new weight and  balance. The mathematical calculation is acceptable if the  exact weight and arm of all the changes are known.  

# Example Calculation After an Equipment Change  

A small, twin-engine airplane has some new equipment  installed and some of its existing equipment removed. The  details of the equipment changes are shown in  Figure 6-38. To calculate the new empty weight and EWCG, a four- column chart is used.  [Figure 6-39]  In evaluating the weight  and balance calculation shown in  Figure 6-39,  the following  key points should be recognized.  

•	 The weight of the equipment needs to be identified  with a plus or minus to signify whether it is being  installed or removed. •	 The sign of the moment (plus or minus) is determined  by the signs of the weight and arm.  •	 The strobe and the ADF are both being removed  (negative weight), but only the strobe has a negative  moment. This is because the arm for the ADF is  also negative, and two negatives multiplied together  produce a positive result.  •	 The total arm is the airplane’s CG and is found by  dividing the total moment by the total weight.  

![](images/e53bfca8f525d8ec3376cf939e724424cb2f20d025eed9c8534f059a2a6ecb3a.jpg)

Figure 6-36.   Example airplane for extreme condition checks.  

•	 The result of the equipment change is that the  airplane’s weight was reduced by 22.5 lb and the CG  has moved forward  $0.67"$  .  

# Use of Ballast  

Ballast is used in an aircraft to attain the desired CG balance,  when the CG is not within limits or is not at the location  desired by the operator. It is usually located as far aft or as  far forward as possible to bring the CG within limits, while  using a minimum amount of weight.  

# Temporary Ballast  

Temporary ballast, in the form of lead bars, heavy canvas  bags of sand, or lead shot, is often carried in the baggage  compartments to adjust the balance for certain flight  conditions. The bags are marked “Ballast XX Pounds–  Removal Requires Weight and Balance Check.” Temporary  ballast must be secured so it cannot shift its location in flight,  and the structural limits of the baggage compartment must not  be exceeded. All temporary ballast must be removed before  the aircraft is weighed.  

Temporary Ballast Formula  

The CG of a loaded airplane can be moved into its allowable  range by shifting passengers or cargo or by adding temporary  ballast. To determine the amount of temporary ballast needed,  use this formula:  

Total wt.  $\times$   dist. needed to shift CG 	 =     needed	        Dist. between ballast and desired CG  

Figures 6-36  and  6-40  show an aft adverse-loaded CG check  being performed on an airplane. In this previous example,  the airplane’s CG was out of limits by   $0.6"$  . If there were a  need or a desire to fly the airplane loaded this way, one way  to make it possible would be the installation of temporary  ballast in the front of the airplane. The logical choice for  placement of this ballast is the forward baggage compartment. The CG for this airplane is   $0.6"$   too far aft. If the forward  baggage compartment is used as a temporary ballast location,  the ballast calculation will be as shown in  Figure 6-41.  

Total wt.  $\times$   dist. needed to shift CG Ballast weight 	 =     needed	        Dist. between ballast and desired CG  

![Figure 6-37.   Center of gravity extreme conditions check. ](images/a0864eb8f07b7ca39e94c31afab1af825bd1e615adf8cda867d35a40e50334cd.jpg)  

$$
=\frac{\hphantom{-}3,034\,1\mathrm{b}\times(0.6")}{39"}
$$  

When ballast is calculated, the answer should always be  rounded up to the next higher whole pound, or in this case, 47  lb of ballast would be used. To ensure the ballast calculation  is correct, the weight of the ballast should be plugged back  into the four-column calculation and a new CG calculated.  

The aft limit for the airplane was 99", and the new CG is at   $98.96"$  , which puts it within acceptable limits. The new CG  did not fall exactly at   $99"$   because the amount of needed  ballast was rounded up to the next whole pound. If the ballast  could have been placed farther forward, such as being bolted  to the engine firewall, less ballast would have been needed.  That is why ballast is always placed as far away from the  affected limit as possible.  

In evaluating the ballast calculation shown above, the  following key points should be recognized.  

•	 The loaded weight of the aircraft, as identified in the  formula, is what the airplane weighed when the CG  was out of limits. •	 The distance the CG is out of limits is the difference  between the CG location and the CG limit, in this case   $99.6"$   minus 99". •	 The affected limit identified in the formula is the CG  limit which has been exceeded. If the CG is too far  aft, it is the aft limit that has been exceeded.  •	 The aft limit for this example is  $99"$  , and the ballast  

![](images/0b9b9d4c9766cc07adf56f27c41914e7e56c28aa90507a3e53e75170d7dc9a2e.jpg)  

is being placed in the baggage compartment at  an arm of   $60"$  . The difference between the two  is   $39"$  , the quantity divided by in the formula.  

Viewed as a first-class lever problem,  Figure 6-42  shows  what this ballast calculation would look like. A ballast weight  of 46.68 lb on the left side of the lever multiplied by the arm  of  $39"$   (99 minus 60) would equal the aircraft weight of 3,034  lb multiplied by the distance the CG is out of limits, which  is   $0.6"$   (99.6 minus 99).  

# Permanent Ballast  

If a repair or alteration causes the aircraft CG to fall outside  of its limit, permanent ballast can be installed. Usually,  permanent ballast is made of blocks of lead painted red and  marked “Permanent Ballast–Do Not Remove.” It should be  attached to the structure so that it does not interfere with any  control action, and attached rigidly enough that it cannot be  dislodged by any flight maneuvers or rough landing. The  installation of permanent ballast results in an increase in the  aircraft empty weight, and it reduces the useful load.  

Three things must be known to determine the amount of  ballast needed to bring the CG within limits: the amount  the CG is out of limits, the distance between the location of  the ballast, and the limit that is affected. If an airplane with  an empty weight of 1,876 lb has been altered so its EWCG  is   $+32.2$  , and CG range for weights up to 2,250 lb is  $+33.0$  to  $+46.0$  , permanent ballast must be installed to move the  EWCG from  $+32.2$   to  $+33.0$  . There is a bulkhead at fuselage  station 228 strong enough to support the ballast. To determine  the amount of ballast needed, use this formula:  

Aircraft empty wt.  $\times$   dist. out of limits Ballast weight	 =       	  	        Dist. between ballast and desired CG  

![](images/c9fdaad9d74d3ca392cb6edc11af20f531993b773028a6c9eff34cd320b6cb0e.jpg)  

A block of lead weighing 7.7 pounds attached to the bulkhead  at fuselage station 228, moves the EWCG back to its proper  forward limit of   $+33$  . This block should be painted red and  marked “Permanent Ballast– Do Not Remove.”  

# Loading Graphs & CG Envelopes  

The weight and balance computation system, commonly  called the loading graph and CG envelope system, is an  excellent and rapid method for determining the CG location  for various loading arrangements. This method can be applied  to any make and model of aircraft, but is more often seen  with small GA aircraft.  

Aircraft manufacturers using this method of weight and  balance computation prepare graphs like those shown in  Figures 6-43  and   $_{6-44}$   for each make and model aircraft  at the time of original certification. The graphs become  a permanent part of the aircraft records and are typically  found in the AFM/POH. These graphs, used in conjunction  with the empty weight and EWCG data found in the weight  and balance report, allow the pilot to plot the CG for the  loaded aircraft.  

The loading graph in  Figure 6-43  is used to determine the  index number (moment value) of any item or weight that may  be involved in loading the aircraft. To use this graph, find the  point on the vertical scale that represents the known weight.  Project a horizontal line to the point where it intersects the  proper diagonal weight line (i.e., pilot, copilot, baggage).  Where the horizontal line intersects the diagonal, project  a vertical line downward to determine the loaded moment  (index number) for the weight being added.  

After the moment for each item of weight has been  

![](images/253de0ffd3b042f00787a81d813af2a4348f501fc424b568dd43e550e35fca80.jpg)  

![Figure 6-41.   Ballast calculation. ](images/b64f996a56b5b34ccd8a53e895ff0c92c68d526429b961b84056fc1822fbcb0c.jpg)  

determined, all weights are added and all moments are  added. The total weight and moment is then plotted on the  CG envelope.  [Figure 6-44]  The total weight is plotted on the  vertical scale of the graph, with a horizontal line projected out  from that point. The total moment is plotted on the horizontal  scale of the graph, with a vertical line projected up from that  point. Where the horizontal and vertical plot lines intersect  on the graph is the CG for the loaded aircraft. If the point  where the plot lines intersect falls inside the CG envelope,  the aircraft CG is within limits. In  Figure 6-44,  there are two  CG envelopes, one for the aircraft in the Normal Category  and one for the aircraft in the Utility Category.  

The loading graph and CG envelope shown in  Figures 6-43  and  6-44  are for an airplane with the following specifications and  weight and balance data.  

•	 Number of seats: 	 	 4 •	 Fuel capacity (usable): 	 38 gal of Avgas •	 Oil capacity: 	 	 8 qt (included in empty  	 	 	 	 weight) •	 Baggage: 	 	 	 120 lb •	 Empty weight: 	 	 1,400 lb •	 EWCG: 	 	 	 38.5" •	 Empty weight moment: 	 53,900 in-lb  

An example of loading the airplane for flight and calculating  the total loaded weight and the total loaded moment is shown  

![](images/19e5cef26b2f90cea247c89c359eb7062668aa3f728a0a00963dab2582cd8fb3.jpg)  
Figure 6-42.   Ballast calculation as a first class lever.  

in  Figures 6-45  and   $_{6-46,}$  .  The use of the loading graph to  determine the moment for each of the useful load items is  shown in  Figure 6-46.  The color used for each useful load  item in  Figure 6-45  matches the color used for the plot on  the loading graph.  

The total loaded weight of the airplane is 2,258 lb and the  total loaded moment is 99,400 in-lb. These two numbers can  now be plotted on the CG envelope to see if the airplane is  within CG limits.  Figure 6-47  shows the CG envelope with  the loaded weight and moment of the airplane plotted. The  CG location shown falls within the normal category envelope,  so the airplane is within CG limits for this category.  

It is interesting to note that the lines that form the CG  envelope are graphic plots of the forward and aft CG limits.  In  Figure 6-47,  the red line is a graphic plot of the forward  limit, and the blue and green lines are graphic plots of the  aft limit for the two different categories.  

# Helicopter Weight & Balance  

# General Concepts  

All the terminology and concepts that apply to airplane  weight and balance also apply generally to helicopter weight  and balance. However, there are some specific differences  that need to be identified.  

Most helicopters have a much more restricted CG range  than airplanes. In some cases, this range is less than 3". The  exact location and length of the CG range is specified for  each helicopter and usually extends a short distance fore  and aft of the main rotor mast or centered between the main  rotors of a dual rotor system. Whereas airplanes have a CG  range only along the longitudinal axis, helicopters have both  longitudinal and lateral CG ranges. Because the wings extend  outward from the CG, airplanes tend to have a great deal of  lateral stability. A helicopter, on the other hand, acts like a  pendulum, with the weight of the helicopter hanging from  the main rotor shaft.  

Ideally, the helicopter should have such perfect balance  that the fuselage remains horizontal while in a hover. If  the helicopter is too nose heavy or tail heavy while it is  hovering, the cyclic pitch control is used to keep the fuselage  horizontal. If the CG location is too extreme, it may not be  possible to keep the fuselage horizontal or maintain control  of the helicopter.  

# Helicopter Weighing  

When a helicopter is being weighed, the location of both  longitudinal and lateral weighing points must be known to  determine its empty weight and EWCG. This is because  helicopters have longitudinal and lateral CG limits. As with  the airplane, the longitudinal arms are measured from the  datum, with locations behind the datum being positive arms  and locations in front of the datum being negative arms.  Laterally, the arms are measured from the butt line, which is  a line from the nose to the tail running through the middle of  the helicopter. When facing forward, arms to the right of the  butt line are positive; to the left they are negative.  

Before a helicopter is weighed, it must be leveled  longitudinally and laterally. This can be done with a spirit  

![](images/be858a6f60e0db71b8a8d78b8f58b5906bccfc8b9ec069820857527d7496b59e.jpg)

level, but often it is done with a plumb bob. For example,  the Bell JetRanger has a location inside the aft cabin where a  plumb can be attached and allowed to hang down to the cabin  floor. On the cabin floor is a plate bearing cross hairs that  correspond to the horizontal and lateral axis of the helicopter.  When the point of the plumb bob falls in the middle of the  cross hairs, the helicopter is level along both axes. If the tip  of the plumb bob falls forward of this point, the nose of the  helicopter is too low; if it falls to the left of this point, the left  side of the helicopter is too low. In other words, the tip of the  plumb bob always moves toward the low point.  

A Bell JetRanger helicopter is shown in  Figure 6-48  with  the leveling plate depicted on the bottom right of the figure.  The helicopter has three jack pads, two at the front and one  in the back. To weigh this helicopter, three jacks would be  placed on floor scales, and the helicopter would be raised off  the hangar floor. To level the helicopter, the jacks would be  adjusted until the plumb bob point falls exactly in the middle  of the cross hairs.  

![Figure 6-45.   Aircraft load chart. ](images/c79cc7e120d5e5a6fe1f336d68db423ada882ff0d859432ae39576913eb0b2a7.jpg)  

As an example of weighing a helicopter, consider the Bell  JetRanger in  Figure 6-48 , and the following specifications  and weighing data shown in  Figure 6-49.  

Using six-column charts for the calculations, the empty  weight and the longitudinal and lateral CG for the helicopter  is shown in  Figure 6-50.  Based on the calculations in  Figure 6-50,  it has been determined that the empty weight of  the helicopter is 1,985 lb, the longitudinal CG is at  $+108.73"$  ,  and the lateral CG is at  $-0.31"$  .  

# Weight and Balance—Weight-Shift Control  Aircraft and Powered Parachutes  

The terminology, theory, and concepts of weight and balance  that applies to airplanes also applies to weight-shift control  aircraft and powered parachutes. Weight is still weight, and  the balance point is still the balance point. However, there are  a few differences that need to be discussed. Before reading  about the specifics of weight and balance on weight-shift  control aircraft and powered parachutes, be sure to read  about their aerodynamic characteristics in Chapter 5, Physics.  Weight-shift control aircraft and powered parachutes do not  fall under the same Code of Federal Regulations that govern  certified airplanes and helicopters and, therefore, do not have  TCDS or the same type of FAA-mandated weight and balance  reports. Weight and balance information and guidelines are  left to the individual owners and the companies with which  they work in acquiring this type of aircraft. Overall, the  industry that is supplying these aircraft is regulating itself  well, and the safety record is good for those aircraft being  operated by experienced pilots.

# Weight-Shift Control Aircraft  

Weight-shift control aircraft, commonly known by the name  “trikes,” have very few options for loading, because they have  very few places to put useful load items. Some trikes have  only one seat and a fuel tank, so the only variables for a flight  are amount of fuel and weight of the pilot. Some trikes have  two seats and a small storage bin in addition to the fuel tank.  

The most significant factor affecting the weight and balance  of a trike is the weight of the pilot; if the aircraft has two seats,  the weight of the passenger must be considered. The trike  acts somewhat like a single main rotor helicopter because  the weight of the aircraft is hanging like a pendulum under  the wing.  Figure 6-51  shows a two-place trike, in which the  mast and the nose strut come together slightly below the  wing attach point. When the trike is in flight, the weight of  the aircraft is hanging from the wing attach point. The weight  of the engine and fuel is behind this point, the passenger is  almost directly below this point, and the pilot is forward of  this point. The balance of the aircraft is determined by how  all these weights compare.  

The wing attach point, with respect to the wing keel, is an  adjustable location. The attach point can be loosened and  

![](images/bdec715c81218e5d6d723bb5fe5a2b3009cddf4806abf7c6968fbc76f0476266.jpg)

moved slightly forward or slightly aft, depending on the  weight of the occupants. For example, if the aircraft is flown  by a person that weighs more, the attach point can be moved  a little farther aft, bringing the wing forward, to compensate  for the change in CG.  Figure 6-52  shows a close-up of the  wing attach point, and the small amount of forward and aft  movement that is available.  

# Powered Parachutes  

Powered parachutes have many of the same characteristics  as weight-shift aircraft when it comes to weight and balance.  They have the same limited loading, with only one or two seats  and a fuel tank. They also act like a pendulum, with the weight  of the aircraft hanging beneath the inflated wing (parachute).  

The point at which the inflated wing attaches to the structure  of the aircraft is adjustable to compensate for pilots and  passengers of varying weights. With a very heavy pilot, the  wing attach point would be moved forward to prevent the  aircraft from being too nose heavy.  Figure 6-53  shows the  structure of a powered parachute with the adjustable wing  attach points.  

# Weight & Balance for Large Airplanes  

Weight and balance for large airplanes is almost identical  to what it is for small airplanes, on a much larger scale. If a  technician can weigh a small airplane and calculate its empty  weight and EWCG, that same technician should be able to  do it for a large airplane. The jacks and scales are larger, and  it may take more personnel to handle the equipment, but the  concepts and processes are the same.  

# Built-In Electronic Weighing  

One difference that may be found with large airplanes is the  incorporation of electronic load cells in the aircraft’s landing  gear. With this type of system, the airplane can weigh itself as  it sits on the tarmac. The load cells are built into the axles of  the landing gear, or the landing gear strut, and they work in  the same manner as load cells used with jacks. This system is  currently in use on the Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777, Boeing  787, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, and the wide body Airbus  airplanes like the A-330, A-340, and A-380.  

The Boeing 777 utilizes two independent systems that  provide information to the airplane’s flight management  system (FMS). If the two systems agree on the weight and  CG of the airplane, the data being provided are considered  accurate and the airplane can be dispatched based on that  information. The flight crew has access to the information  on the flight deck by accessing the FMS and bringing up the  weight and balance page.  

# Mean Aerodynamic Chord  

On small airplanes and on all helicopters, the CG location  is identified as being a specific number of inches from the  datum. The CG range is identified the same way. On larger  airplanes, from private business jets to large jumbo jets, the  CG and its range are typically identified in relation to the  width of the wing.  

The width of the wing on an airplane is known as the chord.  If the leading edge and trailing edge of a wing are parallel to  each other, the chord of the wing is the same along the wing’s  length. Business jets and commercial transport airplanes  have wings that are tapered and that are swept back, so the  width of their wings is different along their entire length.  The width is greatest where the wing meets the fuselage  and progressively decreases toward the tip. In relation to the  aerodynamics of the wing, the average length of the chord  on these tapered swept-back wings is known as the mean  aerodynamic chord (MAC).  

On these larger airplanes, the CG is identified as being at a  location that is a specific percent of the mean aerodynamic  chord (  $\%$   MAC). For example, imagine that the MAC on  an airplane is   $100"$  , and the CG falls  $20"$   behind the leading  edge of the MAC. That means it falls one-fifth of the way  back, or at 20 percent of the MAC.  

Figure 6-54  shows a large twin-engine commercial transport  airplane. The datum is forward of the nose of the airplane,  and all the arms are being measured from that point. The CG  for the airplane is shown as an arm measured in inches. In  the lower left corner of the figure, a cross section of the wing  is shown, with the same CG information being presented.  

To convert the CG location from inches to a percent of MAC,  for the airplane shown in  Figure 6-54,  the steps are as follows:  

1.	 Identify the CG location, in inches from the datum. 2.	 Identify the leading edge of the MAC (LEMAC), in  inches from the datum. 3.	 Subtract LEMAC from the CG location. 4.	 Divide the difference by the length of the MAC. 5.	 Convert the result in decimals to a percentage by  multiplying by 100.  

would be:  

$$
\mathrm{Percent~of~MC}\,=\,\frac{\mathrm{CG\,-\,\,LESMC}}{\mathrm{MC}}\times100
$$  

The result using the numbers shown in  Figure 6-52  would be:  

$$
\mathrm{Percent~of~MC}\,=\,\frac{\mathrm{CG\,-\,\,LESMC}}{\mathrm{MC}}\times100
$$

If the CG is known in percent of MAC, and there is a need  to know the CG location in inches from the datum, the  conversion would be done as follows:  

1.	 Convert the percent of MAC to a decimal by dividing  by 100. 2.	 Multiply the decimal by the length of the MAC.  

![](images/9097cfa8bf954b8d12c59026f06cf5c22baf0a2ab5f0ff66079e5456c75a1324.jpg)

3.	 Add this number to LEMAC.  

As a formula, the solution to convert a percent of MAC to  an inch value would be:  

CG in inches	 = % MAC ÷ 100 × MAC + LEMAC  

For the airplane in  Figure 6-54,  if the CG was at 32.5 percent  of the MAC, the solution would be:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{CG\;in\;injcell}\;=\;\%\;\mathrm{MAC}\div100\times\mathrm{MAC}+\mathrm{LESMA}}\\ &{=\;32.5\div100\times180+900}\\ &{=\;958.5}\end{array}
$$  

# Weight & Balance Records  

When a technician gets involved with the weight and balance  of an aircraft, it almost always involves a calculation of the  aircraft’s empty weight and EWCG. Only on rare occasions  are technicians involved in calculating adverse-loading CG  checks, how much ballast is needed, or the loaded weight  and balance of the aircraft. Calculating the empty weight  and EWCG might involve putting the aircraft on scales and  weighing it, or a pencil and paper exercise after installing a  new piece of equipment.  

The FAA requires that a current and accurate empty weight  and EWCG be known for an aircraft. This information must  be included in the weight and balance report, which is a part  of the aircraft permanent records. The weight and balance  report must be in the aircraft when it is being flown.  

There is no required format for this report, but  Figure 6-55 is a good example of recording the data obtained from  weighing an aircraft. As it is currently laid out, the form  would accommodate either a tricycle gear or tail dragger  airplane. Depending on the gear type, either the nose or the  tail row would be used. If an airplane is being weighed using  jacks and load cells, or if a helicopter is being weighed, the

item names must be changed to reflect the weight locations.  

If an equipment change is being done on an aircraft, and the  new weight and balance is calculated mathematically instead  of weighing the aircraft, the same type of form shown in  Figure 6-55  can be used. The only change would be the use  of a four-column solution, instead of six columns, and there  would be no tare weight or involvement with fuel and oil.  

# Chapter 7 Aircraft Materials, Hardware, &  Processes  

# Aircraft Metals  

Knowledge and understanding of the uses, strengths,  limitations, and other characteristics of structural metals  is vital to properly construct and maintain any equipment,  especially airframes. In aircraft maintenance and repair,  even a slight deviation from design specification, or the  substitution of inferior materials, may result in the loss of  both lives and equipment. The use of unsuitable materials can  readily erase the finest craftsmanship. The selection of the  correct material for a specific repair job demands familiarity  with the most common physical properties of various metals.  

# Properties of Metals  

Of primary concern in aircraft maintenance are such general  properties of metals and their alloys as hardness, malleability,  ductility, elasticity, toughness, density, brittleness, fusibility,  conductivity contraction and expansion, and so forth. These  terms are explained to establish a basis for further discussion  of structural metals.  

# Hardness  

Hardness refers to the ability of a material to resist abrasion,  penetration, cutting action, or permanent distortion. Hardness  may be increased by cold-working the metal and, in the case  of steel and certain aluminum alloys, by heat-treatment.  Structural parts are often formed from metals in their soft  state and are then heat-treated to harden them so that the  finished shape is retained. Hardness and strength are closely  associated properties of metals.  

# Strength  

One of the most important properties of a material is strength.  Strength is the ability of a material to resist deformation.  Strength is also the ability of a material to resist stress without  breaking. The type of load or stress on the material affects  the strength it exhibits.  

# Density  

Density is the weight of a unit volume of a material. In  aircraft work, the specified weight of a material per cubic  inch is preferred since this figure can be used in determining  the weight of a part before actual manufacture. Density is  an important consideration when choosing a material to be  used in the design of a part to maintain the proper weight  and balance of the aircraft.  

# Malleability  

A metal that can be hammered, rolled, or pressed into various  shapes without cracking, breaking, or leaving some other  detrimental effect, is said to be malleable. This property is  necessary in sheet metal that is worked into curved shapes,  such as cowlings, fairings, or wingtips. Copper is an example  of a malleable metal.  

# Ductility  

Ductility is the property of a metal that permits it to be  permanently drawn, bent, or twisted into various shapes  without breaking. This property is essential for metals used in  making wire and tubing. Ductile metals are greatly preferred  for aircraft use because of their ease of forming and resistance  to failure under shock loads. For this reason, aluminum alloys  are used for cowl rings, fuselage and wing skin, and formed  or extruded parts, such as ribs, spars, and bulkheads. Chrome  molybdenum steel is also easily formed into desired shapes.  Ductility is similar to malleability.  

# Elasticity  

Elasticity is a property that enables a metal to return to  its original size and shape when the force that causes the  change of shape is removed. This property is extremely  valuable, because it would be highly undesirable to have  a part permanently distorted after an applied load was  removed. Each metal has a point known as the elastic limit,  beyond which it cannot be loaded without causing permanent  distortion. In aircraft construction, members and parts are so  designed that the maximum loads to which they are subjected  do not stress them beyond their elastic limits. This desirable  property is present in spring steel.  

# Toughness  

A material that possesses toughness withstands tearing or  shearing and may be stretched or otherwise deformed without  breaking. Toughness is a desirable property in aircraft metals.  

# Brittleness  

Brittleness is the property of a metal that allows little bending  or deformation without shattering. A brittle metal is apt to  break or crack without change of shape. Because structural  metals are often subjected to shock loads, brittleness is not a  very desirable property. Cast iron, cast aluminum, and very  hard steel are examples of brittle metals.  

# Fusibility  

Fusibility is the ability of a metal to become liquid by  the application of heat. Metals are fused in welding.  Steels fuse around   ${2},600\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and aluminum alloys at  approximately   $1{,}100\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  .  

# Conductivity  

Conductivity is the property that enables a metal to carry heat  or electricity. The heat conductivity of a metal is especially  important in welding, because it governs the amount of heat  that is required for proper fusion. Conductivity of the metal,  to a certain extent, determines the type of jig to be used to  control expansion and contraction. In aircraft, electrical  conductivity must also be considered in conjunction with  bonding to eliminate radio interference.  

# Thermal Expansion  

Thermal expansion refers to contraction and expansion that  are reactions produced in metals as the result of heating or  cooling. Heat applied to a metal causes it to expand or become  larger. Cooling and heating affect the design of welding jigs,  castings, and tolerances necessary for hot rolled material.  

# Ferrous Aircraft Metals  

Many different metals are required in the repair of aircraft.  This is a result of the varying needs with respect to strength,  weight, durability, and resistance to deterioration of specific  structures or parts. In addition, the particular shape or form of  the material plays an important role. In selecting materials for  aircraft repair, these factors (plus many others) are considered  in relation to the mechanical and physical properties. Among  the common materials used are ferrous metals. The term  “ferrous” applies to the group of metals having iron as their  principal element.  

# Iron  

If carbon is added to iron in percentages ranging up to  approximately 1 percent, the product is vastly superior to iron  alone and is classified as carbon steel. Carbon steel forms  the base of those alloy steels produced by combining carbon  steel with other elements known to improve the properties of  steel. A base metal (such as iron) to which small quantities of  other metals have been added is called an alloy. The addition  of other metals changes or improves the chemical or physical  properties of the base metal for a particular use.  

# Steel and Steel Alloys  

To facilitate the discussion of steels some familiarity with  their nomenclature is desirable. A numerical index, sponsored  by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the  American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), is used to identify  the chemical compositions of the structural steels. In this  system, a four-numeral series is used to designate the plain  carbon and alloy steels; five numerals are used to designate  certain types of alloy steels. The first two digits indicate the  type of steel, the second digit also generally (but not always)  gives the approximate amount of the major alloying element,  and the last two (or three) digits are intended to indicate  the approximate middle of the carbon range. However, a  deviation from the rule of indicating the carbon range is  sometimes necessary.  

Small quantities of certain elements are present in alloy  steels that are not specified as required. These elements are  considered as incidental and may be present to the maximum  amounts as follows: copper, 0.35 percent; nickel, 0.25  percent; chromium, 0.20 percent; molybdenum, 0.06 percent. The list of standard steels is altered from time to time to  accommodate steels of proven merit and to provide for  changes in the metallurgical and engineering requirements  of industry.  [Figure 7-1]  

Metal stock is manufactured in several forms and shapes,  including sheets, bars, rods, tubing, extrusions, forgings,  and castings. Sheet metal is made in a number of sizes  and thicknesses. Specifications designate thicknesses in  thousandths of an inch. Bars and rods are supplied in a variety  of shapes, such as round, square, rectangular, hexagonal, and  octagonal. Tubing can be obtained in round, oval, rectangular,  or streamlined shapes. The size of tubing is generally  specified by outside diameter and wall thickness.  

The sheet metal is usually formed cold in machines, such as  presses, bending brakes, draw benches, or rolls. Forgings are  shaped or formed by pressing or hammering heated metal  in dies. Pouring molten metal into molds produces castings.  Machining finishes the casting.  

Spark testing is a common means of identifying various  ferrous metals. In this test, the piece of iron or steel is held  against a revolving grinding stone, and the metal is identified  by the sparks thrown off. Each ferrous metal has its own  peculiar spark characteristics. The spark streams vary from  a few tiny shafts to a shower of sparks several feet in length.  (Few nonferrous metals give off sparks when touched to a  grinding stone. Therefore, these metals cannot be successfully  identified by the spark test.)  

Identification by spark testing is often inexact unless  performed by an experienced person or the test pieces differ  greatly in their carbon content and alloying elements.  

Wrought iron produces long shafts that are straw colored as  they leave the stone and white at the end. Cast iron sparks  are red as they leave the stone and turn to a straw color.  Low carbon steels give off long, straight shafts having a few  white sprigs. As the carbon content of the steel increases, the  number of sprigs along each shaft increases and the stream  becomes whiter in color. Nickel steel causes the spark stream  to contain small white blocks of light within the main burst.  

# Types, Characteristics, and Uses of Alloyed Steels  

Steel containing carbon in percentages ranging from 0.10 to  0.30 percent is classed as low carbon steel. The equivalent  SAE numbers range from 1010 to 1030. Steels of this grade  are used for making items, such as safety wire, certain nuts,  cable bushings, or threaded rod ends. This steel in sheet  form is used for secondary structural parts and clamps and  in tubular form for moderately stressed structural parts.  

Steel containing carbon in percentages ranging from 0.30 to  0.50 percent is classed as medium carbon steel. This steel  is especially adaptable for machining or forging and where  surface hardness is desirable. Certain rod ends and light  forgings are made from SAE 1035 steel.  

Steel containing carbon in percentages ranging from 0.50 to  1.05 percent is classed as high carbon steel. The addition of  other elements in varying quantities adds to the hardness of  this steel. In the fully heat-treated condition, it is very hard,  withstands high shear and wear, and has little deformation. It  has limited use in aircraft. SAE 1095 in sheet form is used for  making flat springs and in wire form for making coil springs.  

The various nickel steels are produced by combining nickel  with carbon steel. Steels containing from 3 to 3.75 percent  nickels are commonly used. Nickel increases the hardness,  tensile strength, and elastic limit of steel without appreciably  decreasing the ductility. It also intensifies the hardening effect  of heat-treatment. SAE 2330 steel is used extensively for  aircraft parts, such as bolts, terminals, keys, clevises, and pins.  

Chromium steel is high in hardness, strength, and corrosion-  resistant properties and is particularly adaptable for heat-treated  forgings, which require greater toughness and strength than  may be obtained in plain carbon steel. It can be used for articles  such as the balls and rollers of antifriction bearings. Chrome- nickel or stainless steels are the corrosion resistant metals.  The anticorrosive degree of this steel is determined by the  surface condition of the metal, as well as by the composition,  temperature, and concentration of the corrosive agent. The  principal alloy of stainless steel is chromium. The corrosion  resistant steel most often used in aircraft construction is known  as 18-8 steel because its content is 18 percent chromium and  8 percent nickel. One of the distinctive features of 18-8 steel  is that cold-working may increase its strength.  

Stainless steel may be rolled, drawn, bent, or formed to any  shape. Because these steels expand about 50 percent more  than mild steel and conduct heat only about 40 percent as  rapidly, they are more difficult to weld. Stainless steel can be  used for almost any part of an aircraft. Some of its common  applications are the fabrication of exhaust collectors, stacks  and manifolds, structural and machined parts, springs,  castings, tie rods, and control cables.  

The chrome-vanadium steels are made of approximately  18 percent vanadium and about 1 percent chromium. When  heat-treated, they have strength, toughness, and resistance to  wear and fatigue. A special grade of this steel in sheet form  can be cold formed into intricate shapes. It can be folded and  flattened without signs of breaking or failure. SAE 6150 is  used for making springs; chrome-vanadium with high carbon  content, SAE 6195, is used for ball and roller bearings.  

Molybdenum in small percentages is used in combination  with chromium to form chrome-molybdenum steel, which  has various uses in aircraft. Molybdenum is a strong alloying  element. It raises the ultimate strength of steel without  affecting ductility or workability. Molybdenum steels are  tough and wear resistant, and they harden throughout when  heat-treated. They are especially adaptable for welding and,  for this reason, are used principally for welded structural  parts and assemblies. This type steel has practically replaced  carbon steel in the fabrication of fuselage tubing, engine  mounts, landing gears, and other structural parts. For example,  a heat-treated SAE X4130 tube is approximately four times  as strong as an SAE 1025 tube of the same weight and size.  

A series of chrome-molybdenum steel most used in aircraft  construction is that series containing 0.25 to 0.55 percent  carbon, 0.15 to 0.25 percent molybdenum, and 0.50 to 1.10  percent chromium. These steels, when suitably heat-treated,  are deep hardening, easily machined, readily welded by either  gas or electric methods, and are especially adapted to high  temperature service.  

Inconel is a nickel-chromium-iron alloy closely resembling  stainless steel (corrosion resistant steel (CRES)) in  appearance. Aircraft exhaust systems use both alloys  interchangeably. Because the two alloys look very much  alike, a distinguishing test is often necessary. One method  of identification is to use an electrochemical technique, as  described in the following paragraph, to identify the nickel  (Ni) content of the alloy. Inconel has nickel content greater  than 50 percent, and the electrochemical test detects nickel.  

The tensile strength of Inconel is 100,000 pounds per square  

![](images/8317d3a9db4b96f561b9716d94928cb78494c8b613f5f2475c6ab48c3ed776ac.jpg)  

inch (psi) annealed, and 125,000 psi when hard rolled. It is  highly resistant to salt water and can withstand temperatures  as high as   $1{,}600\;^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Inconel welds readily and has working  qualities like those of corrosion resistant steels.  

# Electrochemical Test  

Prepare a wiring assembly as shown in  Figure 7-2 , and prepare  the two reagents (ammonium fluoride and dimethyl gly oxime  solutions) placing them in separate dedicated dropper solution  bottles. Before testing, you must thoroughly clean the metal for  the electrolytic deposit to take place. You may use nonmetallic  hand scrubbing pads or 320–600 grit “crocus cloth” to remove  deposits and corrosion products (thermal oxide).  

Connect the alligator clip of the wiring assembly to the bare  metal being tested. Place one drop of a 0.05 percent reagent  grade ammonium fluoride solution in deionized water on  the center of a   $1\;\mathrm{isoch}\times1$   inch sheet of filter paper. Lay the  moistened filter paper over the bare metal alloy being tested.  Firmly press the end of the aluminum rod over the center  of the moist paper. Maintain connection for 10 seconds  while rocking the aluminum rod on the filter paper. Ensure  that the light emitting diode (LED) remains lit (indicating  good electrical contact and current flow) during this period.  Disconnect the wiring assembly and set it aside. Remove  the filter paper and examine it to determine that a light spot  appears where the connection was made.  

Deposit one drop of 1.0 percent solution of reagent grade  dimethyl gly oxime in ethyl alcohol on the filter paper (same  side that was in contact with the test metal). A bright,  distinctly pink spot will appear within seconds on the filter  paper if the metal being tested is Inconel. A brown spot will  appear if the test metal is stainless steel. Some stainless-steel  alloys may leave a very light pink color. However, the shade  and depth of color will be far less than would appear for  Inconel. For flat surfaces, the test spot will be circular while  for curved surfaces, such as the outside of a tube or pipe,  the test spot may appear as a streak. (Refer to  Figure 7-3  for  sample test results.) This procedure should not be used in the  heat-affected zone of weldments or on nickel coated surfaces.  

# Nonferrous Aircraft Metals  

The term “nonferrous” refers to all metals that have elements  other than iron as its base or principal constituent. This  group includes metals, such as aluminum, titanium, copper,  and magnesium, as well as alloyed metals, such as Monel  and Babbitt.  

# Aluminum & Aluminum Alloys  

Commercially pure aluminum is a white lustrous metal,  which stands second in the scale of malleability, sixth  in ductility, and ranks high in its resistance to corrosion.  Aluminum combined with various percentages of other  metals forms alloys, which are used in aircraft construction. Aluminum alloys with principal alloying ingredients are  manganese, chromium, or magnesium and silicon show  little attack in corrosive environments. Alloys with which  substantial percentages of copper are more susceptible to  corrosive action. The total percentage of alloying elements  is seldom more than 6 or 7 percent in the wrought alloys.  

Aluminum is one of the most widely used metals in modern  aircraft construction. It is vital to the aviation industry because  of its high strength-to-weight ratio and its comparative ease  of fabrication. The outstanding characteristic of aluminum  is its lightweight. Aluminum melts at the comparatively low  temperature of   $1{,}250\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . It is nonmagnetic and is an excellent  conductor.  

Commercially pure aluminum has a tensile strength of about  13,000 psi, but rolling or other cold-working processes  may approximately double its strength. By alloying with  other metals, or by using heat-treating processes, the tensile  strength may be raised to as high as 65,000 psi or to within  the strength range of structural steel.  

Aluminum alloys, although strong, are easily worked because  they are malleable and ductile. They may be rolled into  sheets as thin as 0.0017 inch or drawn into wire 0.004 inch  in diameter. Most aluminum alloy sheet stock used in aircraft  construction range from 0.016 to 0.096 inch in thickness;  however, some of the larger aircraft use sheet stock that may  be as thick as 0.356 inch.  

The various types of aluminum may be divided into two  general classes:  

•	 Casting alloys (those suitable for casting in sand,  permanent mold, or die castings) •	 Wrought alloys (those which may be shaped by rolling,  drawing, or forging).  

Of these two, the wrought alloys are the most widely used  in aircraft construction, being used for stringers, bulkheads,  skin, rivets, and extruded sections.  

Aluminum casting alloys are divided into two basic groups.  In one, the physical properties of the alloys are determined  by the alloying elements and cannot be changed after the  metal is cast. In the other, the alloying elements make it

possible to heat-treat the casting to produce the desired  physical properties.  

A letter preceding the alloy number identifies the casting  alloys. When a letter precedes a number, it indicates a slight  variation in the composition of the original alloy. This  variation in composition is simply to impart some desirable  quality. For example, in casting alloy 214, the addition of zinc  to improve its pouring qualities is indicated by the letter A  in front of the number, thus creating the designation A214.  

When castings have been heat-treated, the heat-treatment  and the composition of the casting is indicated by the letter  T, followed by an alloying number. An example of this  is the sand casting alloy 355, which has several different  compositions and tempers and is designated by 355-T6,  355-T51, or C355-T51.  

Aluminum alloy castings are produced by one of three basic  methods: sand mold, permanent mold, or die cast. In casting  aluminum, it is important to note that in most cases different  types of alloys must be used for different types of castings.  Sand castings and die-castings require different types of  alloys than those used in permanent molds.  

Sand and permanent mold castings are parts produced by  pouring molten metal into a previously prepared mold,  allowing the metal to solidify or freeze and then removing the  part. If the mold is made of sand, the part is a sand casting; if  it is a metallic mold (usually cast iron), the part is a permanent  mold casting. Sand and permanent castings are produced by  pouring liquid metal into the mold, the metal flowing under  the force of gravity alone.  

The two principal types of sand casting alloys are 112 and  212. Little difference exists between the two metals in  mechanical properties, since both are adaptable to a wide  range of products.  

The permanent mold process is a later development of the  sand casting process, the major difference being in the  

![](images/119766ee23f34efc027cdf1b5e80d1dff229357f11ab980a351d952475334bd2.jpg)

material from which the molds are made. The advantage of  this process is that there are fewer openings (called porosity)  than in sand castings. The sand and the binder, which is mixed  with the sand to hold it together, give off a certain amount of  gas, that causes porosity in a sand casting.  

Permanent mold castings are used to obtain higher  mechanical properties, better surfaces, or more accurate  dimensions. There are two specific types of permanent  mold castings: permanent metal mold with metal cores, and  semi-permanent types containing sand cores. Because finer  grain structure is produced in alloys subjected to the rapid  cooling of metal molds, they are far superior to the sand type  castings. Alloys 122, A132, and 142 are commonly used in  permanent mold castings, the principal uses of which are in  internal combustion engines.  

Die-castings used in aircraft are usually aluminum or  magnesium alloy. If weight is of primary importance,  magnesium alloy is used, because it is lighter than aluminum  alloy. However, aluminum alloy is frequently used because  it is stronger than most magnesium alloys.  

Forcing molten metal under pressure into a metallic die and  allowing it to solidify produces a die-casting; then the die is  opened and the part removed. The basic difference between  permanent mold casting and die-casting is that in the permanent  mold process, the metal flows into the die under gravity. In the  die-casting operation, the metal is forced under great pressure.  

Die-castings are used where relatively large production of  a given part is involved. Remember, any shape that can be  forged, can be cast.  

Wrought aluminum and wrought aluminum alloys are divided  into two general classes: non-heat-treatable alloys and heat- treatable alloys.  

Non-heat-treatable alloys are those in which the mechanical  properties are determined by the amount of cold-work  introduced after the final annealing operation. The mechanical  properties obtained by cold-working are destroyed by any  subsequent heating and cannot be restored except by  additional cold-working, which is not always possible. The  “full hard” temper is produced by the maximum amount of  cold-work that is commercially practicable. Metal in the “as  fabricated” condition is produced from the ingot without any  subsequent controlled amount of cold-working or thermal  treatment. There is, consequently, a variable amount of strain  hardening depending upon the thickness of the section.  

For heat-treatable aluminum alloys, the mechanical properties  are obtained by heat-treating to a suitable temperature,  holding at that temperature long enough to allow the alloying  constituent to enter into solid solution, and then quenching  to hold the constituent in solution. The metal is left in a  supersaturated, unstable state and is then age hardened either  by natural aging at room temperature or by artificial aging at  some elevated temperature.  

# Wrought Aluminum  

Wrought aluminum and wrought aluminum alloys are  designated by a four-digit index system. The system is broken  into three distinct groups: 1xxx group, 2xxx through 8xxx  group, and 9xxx group (which is currently unused).  

The first digit of a designation identifies the alloy type. The  second digit indicates specific alloy modifications. Should the  second number be zero, it would indicate no special control  over individual impurities. Digits 1 through 9, however, when  assigned consecutively as needed for the second number in  this group, indicate the number of controls over individual  impurities in the metal.  

The last two digits of the 1xxx group are used to indicate  the hundredths of 1 percent above the original 99 percent  designated by the first digit. Thus, if the last two digits were  30, the alloy would contain 99 percent plus 0.30 percent of  pure aluminum, or a total of 99.30 percent pure aluminum.  Examples of alloys in this group are:  

•	 1100—99.00 percent pure aluminum with one control  over individual impurities. •	 1130—99.30 percent pure aluminum with one control  over individual impurities. •	 1275—99.75 percent pure aluminum with two controls  over individual impurities.  

In the 2xxx through 8xxx groups, the first digit indicates the major  alloying element used in the formation of the alloy as follows:  

•	 2xxx—copper •	 3xxx—manganese •	 4xxx—silicon •	 5xxx—magnesium •	 6xxx—magnesium and silicon •	 7xxx—zinc •	 8xxx—other elements  

In the 2xxx through 8xxx alloy groups, the second digit in  the alloy designation indicates alloy modifications. If the  second digit is zero, it indicates the original alloy, while digits  1 through 9 indicate alloy modifications. The last two of the  four digits in the designation identify the different alloys in  

# Effect of Alloying Element  

1000 series: 99 percent aluminum or higher, excellent  corrosion resistance, high thermal and electrical conductivity,  low mechanical properties, excellent workability. Iron and  silicon are major impurities.  

2000 series: Copper is the principal alloying element.  Solution heat-treatment, optimum properties equal to mild  steel, poor corrosion resistance unclad. It is usually clad  with 6000 or high purity alloy. Its best-known alloy is 2024.  

3000 series: Manganese is the principal alloying element  of this group, which is generally non-heat-treatable. The  percentage of manganese that is alloy effective is 1.5 percent.  The most popular is 3003, which is of moderate strength and  has good working characteristics.  

4000 series: Silicon is the principal alloying element of  this group and lowers melting temperature. Its primary  use is in welding and brazing. When used in welding heat- treatable alloys, this group responds to a limited amount  of heat-treatment.  

5000 series: Magnesium is the principal alloying element.  It has good welding and corrosion resistant characteristics.  High temperatures (over   $150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) or excessive cold-working  increases susceptibility to corrosion.  

6000 series: Silicon and magnesium form magnesium  silicide, which makes alloys heat-treatable. It is of medium  strength, good forming qualities, and has corrosion  resistant characteristics.  

7000 series: Zinc is the principal alloying element. The  most popular alloy of the series is 6061. When coupled with  magnesium, it results in heat-treatable alloys of very high  strength. It usually has copper and chromium added. The  principal alloy of this group is 7075.  

# Hardness Identification  

Where used, the temper designation follows the alloy  designation and is separated from it by a dash (i.e., 7075- T6, 2024-T4, and so forth). The temper designation consists  of a letter indicating the basic temper, which may be more  specifically defined by the addition of one or more digits.  These designations are as follows:  

•	 F—as fabricated •	 O—annealed, recrystallized (wrought products only) •	 H—strain hardened  

•	 H1 (plus one or more digits)—strain hardened only •	 H2 (plus one or more digits)—strain hardened and  partially annealed •	 H3 (plus one or more digits)—strain hardened and  stabilized  

The digit following the designations H1, H2, and H3 indicates  the degree of strain hardening, number 8 representing the  ultimate tensile strength equal to that achieved by a cold  reduction of approximately 75 percent following a full anneal,  0 representing the annealed state.  

# Magnesium & Magnesium Alloys  

Magnesium, the world’s lightest structural metal, is a silvery  white material weighing only two-thirds as much as aluminum.  Magnesium does not possess sufficient strength in its pure state  for structural uses, but when alloyed with zinc, aluminum, and  manganese, it produces an alloy having the highest strength- to-weight ratio of any of the commonly used metals.  

Magnesium is probably more widely distributed in nature  than any other metal. It can be obtained from such ores  as dolomite and magnesite, as well as from seawater,  underground brines, and waste solutions of potash. With  about 10 million pounds of magnesium in one cubic mile of  Some of today’s aircraft require more than one-half ton of this  metal for use in hundreds of vital spots. Some wing panels are  fabricated entirely from magnesium alloys, weigh 18 percent  less than standard aluminum panels, and have flown hundreds  of satisfactory hours. Among the aircraft parts that have been  made from magnesium with a substantial savings in weight  are nosewheel doors, flap cover skin, aileron cover skin, oil  tanks, floorings, fuselage parts, wingtips, engine nacelles,  instrument panels, radio masts, hydraulic fluid tanks, oxygen  bottle cases, ducts, and seats.  

Magnesium alloys possess good casting characteristics. Their  properties compare favorably with those of cast aluminum.  In forging, hydraulic presses are ordinarily used, although,  under certain conditions, forging can be accomplished in  mechanical presses or with drop hammers.  

Magnesium alloys are subject to such treatments as annealing,  quenching, solution heat-treatment, aging, and stabilizing.  Sheet and plate magnesium are annealed at the rolling mill.  The solution heat-treatment is used to put as much of the  alloying ingredients as possible into solid solution, which  results in high tensile strength and maximum ductility.  Aging is applied to castings following heat-treatment where  

![Figure 7-4.   Nominal composition of wrought aluminum alloys. ](images/80973a8e0b6067ee2032b83b4bcbed712652a5541ea972a7eeeba265ed931fad.jpg)  

maximum hardness and yield strength are desired.  

Magnesium embodies fire hazards of an unpredictable nature.  When in large sections, its high thermal conductivity makes  it difficult to ignite and prevents it from burning. It does not  burn until the melting point of   ${1}{,}{204}\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   is reached. However,  magnesium dust and fine chips are ignited easily. Precautions  must be taken to avoid this if possible. Should a fire occur, it  could be extinguished with an extinguishing powder, such as  soapstone or graphite. Water or any standard liquid or foam  fire extinguisher causes magnesium to burn more rapidly and  can cause explosions.  

Magnesium alloys produced in the United States contain  varying proportions of aluminum, manganese, and zinc. A  letter of the alphabet designates these alloys, with the number  1 indicating high purity and maximum corrosion resistance.  

Many of the magnesium alloys manufactured in the United  States are produced by the Dow Chemical Company and  have been given the trade name of Dow-metal™ alloys. To  distinguish between these alloys, each is assigned a letter.  Thus, we have Dow-metal™ J, Dow-metal™ M, and so forth.  

Another manufacturer of magnesium alloys is the American  Magnesium Corporation, a subsidiary of the Aluminum  Company of America. This company uses an identification  system like that used for aluminum alloys, with the exception  that magnesium alloy numbers are preceded with the letters  AM. Thus, AM240C is a cast alloy, and AM240C4 is the  same alloy in the heat-treated state. AM3S0 is an annealed  wrought alloy, and AM3SRT is the same alloy rolled after  heat-treatment.  

# Titanium and Titanium Alloys  

An English priest named Gregot discovered titanium. A crude  separation of titanium ore was accomplished in 1825. In 1906,  enough pure titanium was isolated in metallic form to permit  a study. Following this study, in 1932, an extraction process  was developed and became the first commercial method  for producing titanium. The United States Bureau of Mines  began making titanium sponge in 1946, and 4 years later the  melting process began.  

The use of titanium is widespread. It is used in many  commercial enterprises and is in constant demand for such  items as pumps, screens, and other tools and fixtures where  corrosion attack is prevalent. In aircraft construction and  repair, titanium is used for fuselage skins, engine shrouds,  firewalls, longerons, frames, fittings, air ducts, and fasteners.  

Titanium is used for making compressor disks, spacer rings,  compressor blades and vanes, through bolts, turbine housings  and liners, and miscellaneous hardware for turbine engines.  Titanium, in appearance, is like stainless steel. One quick  method used to identify titanium is the spark test. Titanium  gives off a brilliant white trace ending in a brilliant white  burst. Also, moistening the titanium and using it to draw a  line on a piece of glass can accomplish identification. This  leaves a dark line similar in appearance to a pencil mark.  

Titanium falls between aluminum and stainless steel in terms  of elasticity, density, and elevated temperature strength. It  has a melting point from  $2{,}730\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $^{3,155}\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , low thermal  conductivity, and a low coefficient of expansion. It is light,  strong, and resistant to stress corrosion cracking. Titanium is  approximately 60 percent heavier than aluminum and about  50 percent lighter than stainless steel.  

Because of the high melting point of titanium, high  temperature properties are disappointing. The ultimate  yield strength of titanium drops rapidly above   $800\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  The absorption of oxygen and nitrogen from the air at  temperatures above   $1{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   makes the metal so brittle on  long exposure that it soon becomes worthless. However,  titanium does have some merit for short time exposure up to   $3{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   where strength is not important. Aircraft firewalls  demand this requirement.  

Titanium is nonmagnetic and has an electrical resistance  comparable to that of stainless steel. Some of the base alloys  of titanium are quite hard. Heat-treating and alloying do not  develop the hardness of titanium to the high levels of some  of the heat-treated alloys of steel. It was only recently that  a heat-treatable titanium alloy was developed. Prior to the  development of this alloy, heating and rolling was the only  method of forming that could be accomplished. However, it  is possible to form the new alloy in the soft condition and  heat-treat it for hardness.  

Iron, molybdenum, and chromium are used to stabilize  titanium and produce alloys that quench-harden and age- harden. The addition of these metals also adds ductility.  The fatigue resistance of titanium is greater than that of  aluminum or steel.  

Titanium becomes softer as the degree of purity is increased.  It is not practical to distinguish between the various grades of  commercially pure or unalloyed titanium by chemical analysis;  therefore, the grades are determined by mechanical properties.  

# Titanium Designations  

The A-B-C classification of titanium alloys was established  to provide a convenient and simple means of describing all  titanium alloys. Titanium and titanium alloys possess three  basic types of crystals: A (alpha), B (beta), and C (combined  alpha and beta). Their characteristics are:  

•	 A (alpha)—all-around performance; good weld ability;  tough and strong both cold and hot; and resistant to  oxidation. •	 B (beta)—bendability; excellent bend ductility; strong  both cold and hot, but vulnerable to contamination. •	 C (combined alpha and beta for compromise  performances)—strong when cold and warm, but weak  when hot; good bendability; moderate contamination  resistance; excellent forge ability.  

Titanium is manufactured for commercial use in two basic  compositions: commercially-pure titanium and alloyed  titanium. A-55 is an example of commercially-pure titanium.  It has yield strength of 55,000 to 80,000 psi and is a general- purpose grade for moderate to severe forming. It is sometimes  used for nonstructural aircraft parts and for all types of  corrosion-resistant applications, such as tubing. Type A-70  titanium is closely related to type A-55 but has yield strength  of 70,000 to 95,000 psi. It is used where higher strength is  required, and it is specified for many moderately stressed  aircraft parts. For many corrosion applications, it is used  interchangeably with type A-55. Both type A-55 and type  A-70 is weldable.  

One of the widely-used titanium base alloys is designated  as C-110M. It is used for primary structural members and  aircraft skin, has 110,000 psi minimum yield strength, and  contains 8 percent manganese.  

Type A-110AT is a titanium alloy that contains 5 percent  aluminum and 2.5 percent tin. It also has high minimum yield  strength at elevated temperatures with the excellent welding  characteristics inherent in alpha-type titanium alloys.  

# Corrosion Characteristics  

The corrosion resistance of titanium deserves special  mention. The resistance of the metal to corrosion is caused  by the formation of a protective surface film of stable oxide  or chemi-absorbed oxygen. Film is often produced by the  presence of oxygen and oxidizing agents.  

Corrosion of titanium is uniform. There is little evidence of  pitting or other serious forms of localized attack. Normally,  it is not subject to stress corrosion, corrosion fatigue,  intergranular corrosion, or galvanic corrosion. Its corrosion  resistance is equal or superior to 18-8 stainless steel.  

Laboratory tests with acid and saline solutions show titanium  polarizes readily. The net effect, in general, is to decrease  current flow in galvanic and corrosion cells. Corrosion  currents on the surface of titanium and metallic couples are  naturally restricted. This partly accounts for good resistance  to many chemicals; also, the material may be used with some  dissimilar metals with no harmful galvanic effect on either.  

# Copper and Copper Alloys  

Copper is one of the most widely distributed metals. It is  the only reddish-colored metal and is second only to silver  in electrical conductivity. Its use as a structural material is  limited because of its great weight. However, some of its  outstanding characteristics, such as its high electrical and heat  conductivity, in many cases overbalance the weight factor.  

Because it is very malleable and ductile, copper is ideal for  making wire. It is corroded by salt water but is not affected  by fresh water. The ultimate tensile strength of copper varies  greatly. For cast copper, the tensile strength is about 25,000  psi, and when cold rolled or cold drawn, its tensile strength  increases to a range of 40,000 to 67,000 psi.  

In aircraft, copper is used primarily in the electrical system  for bus bars, bonding, and as lock wire.  

Beryllium copper is one of the most successful of all  the copper base alloys. It is a recently developed alloy  containing about 97 percent copper, 2 percent beryllium, and  sufficient nickel to increase the percentage of elongation.  The most valuable feature of this metal is that the physical  properties can be greatly stepped up by heat-treatment, the  tensile strength rising from 70,000 psi in the annealed state  to 200,000 psi in the heat-treated state. The resistance of  beryllium copper to fatigue and wear makes it suitable for  diaphragms, precision bearings and bushings, ball cages,  and spring washers.  

Brass is a copper alloy containing zinc and small amounts  of aluminum, iron, lead, manganese, magnesium, nickel,  phosphorous, and tin. Brass with a zinc content of 30 to 35  percent is very ductile, but that containing 45 percent has  relatively high strength.  

Muntz metal is a brass composed of 60 percent copper and 40  percent zinc. It has excellent corrosion-resistant qualities in  salt water. Its strength can be increased by heat-treatment. As  cast, this metal has an ultimate tensile strength of 50,000 psi,  and it can be elongated 18 percent. It is used in making bolts  and nuts, as well as parts that come in contact with salt water. Red brass, sometimes termed “bronze” because of its tin  content, is used in fuel and oil line fittings. This metal has  good casting and finishing properties and machines freely.  

Bronzes are copper alloys containing tin. The true bronzes have  up to 25 percent tin, but those with less than 11 percent are  Among the copper alloys are the copper aluminum alloys,  of which the aluminum bronzes rank very high in aircraft  usage. They would find greater usefulness in structures if  it were not for their strength-to-weight ratio as compared  with alloy steels. Wrought aluminum bronzes are almost as  strong and ductile as medium carbon steel, and they possess  a high degree of resistance to corrosion by air, salt water, and  chemicals. They are readily forged, hot or cold rolled, and  many react to heat-treatment.  

These copper base alloys contain up to 16 percent of aluminum  (usually 5 to 11 percent), to which other metals, such as iron,  nickel, or manganese, may be added. Aluminum bronzes have  good tearing qualities, great strength, hardness, and resistance  to both shock and fatigue. Because of these properties, they are  used for diaphragms, gears, and pumps. Aluminum bronzes  are available in rods, bars, plates, sheets, strips, and forgings.  

Cast aluminum bronzes, using about 89 percent copper, 9  percent aluminum, and 2 percent of other elements, have  high strength combined with ductility and are resistant to  corrosion, shock, and fatigue. Because of these properties,  cast aluminum bronze is used in bearings and pump parts.  These alloys are useful in areas exposed to salt water and  corrosive gases.  

Manganese bronze is an exceptionally high strength, tough,  corrosion-resistant copper zinc alloy containing aluminum,  manganese, iron, and occasionally, nickel or tin. This metal  can be formed, extruded, drawn, or rolled to any desired  shape. In rod form, it is generally used for machined parts  for aircraft landing gears and brackets.  

Silicon bronze is a more recent development composed of  about 95 percent copper, 3 percent silicon, and 2 percent  manganese, zinc, iron, tin, and aluminum. Although not a  bronze in the true sense because of its small tin content, silicon  bronze has high strength and great corrosion resistance.  

# Monel  

Monel, the leading high nickel alloy, combines the properties  of high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. This metal  consists of 68 percent nickel, 29 percent copper, 0.2 percent  iron, 1 percent manganese, and 1.8 percent of other elements.  It cannot be hardened by heat-treatment.  

Monel, adaptable to casting and hot or cold-working, can be  successfully welded. It has working properties like those of  steel. When forged and annealed, it has a tensile strength of  80,000 psi. This can be increased by cold-working to 125,000  psi, sufficient for classification among the tough alloys.  

Monel has been successfully used for gears and chains to  operate retractable landing gears and for structural parts subject  to corrosion. In aircraft, Monel is used for parts demanding  both strength and high resistance to corrosion, such as exhaust  manifolds and carburetor needle valves and sleeves.  

# K-Monel  

K-Monel is a nonferrous alloy containing mainly nickel,  copper, and aluminum. Adding a small amount of aluminum  to the Monel formula produces it. It is corrosion resistant and  capable of being hardened by heat-treatment.  

K-Monel has been successfully used for gears and structural  members in aircraft, which are subjected to corrosive  attacks. This alloy is nonmagnetic at all temperatures. Both  oxyacetylene and electric arc welding have successfully  welded K-Monel sheet.  

# Nickel & Nickel Alloys  

There are basically two nickel alloys used in aircraft: Monel  and Inconel. Monel contains about 68 percent nickel and 29  percent copper, plus small amounts of iron and manganese.  Nickel alloys can be welded or easily machined. Some of the  nickel Monel, especially the nickel Monels containing small  amounts of aluminum, are heat-treatable to similar tensile  strengths of steel. Nickel Monel is used in gears and parts  that require high strength and toughness, such as exhaust  systems that require high strength and corrosion resistance  at elevated temperatures.  

Inconel alloys of nickel produce a high strength, high  temperature alloy containing approximately 80 percent  nickel, 14 percent chromium, and small amounts of iron  and other elements. The nickel Inconel alloys are frequently  used in turbine engines because of their ability to maintain  their strength and corrosion resistance under extremely high-  temperature conditions.  

Inconel and stainless steel are similar in appearance and are  frequently found in the same areas of the engine. Sometimes  it is important to identify the difference between the metal  samples. A common test is to apply one drop of cupric  chloride and hydrochloric acid solution to the unknown metal  and allow it to remain for 2 minutes. At the end of the soak  period, a shiny spot indicates the material is nickel Inconel,  and a copper-colored spot indicates stainless steel.  

# Substitution of Aircraft Metals  

In selecting substitute metals for the repair and maintenance  of aircraft, it is very important to check the appropriate  structural repair manual. Aircraft manufacturers design  structural members to meet a specific load requirement for an  aircraft. The methods of repairing these members, apparently  similar in construction, vary with different aircraft.  

Four requirements must be kept in mind when selecting  substitute metals. The first and most important of these is  maintaining the original strength of the structure. The other  three are maintaining contour or aerodynamic smoothness;  maintaining original weight, if possible, or keeping added  weight to a minimum; and maintaining the original corrosion-  resistant properties of the metal.  

# Metalworking Processes  

There are three methods of metalworking: hot-working,  cold-working, and extruding. The method used depends on  the metal involved and the part required, although in some  instances both hot and cold-working methods may be used  to make a single part.  

# Hot-Working  

Almost all steel is hot-worked from the ingot into some form  from which it is either hot or cold-worked to the finished  shape. When an ingot is stripped from its mold, its surface is  solid, but the interior is still molten. The ingot is then placed  in a soaking pit, which retards loss of heat, and the molten  interior gradually solidifies. After soaking, the temperature  is equalized throughout the ingot, then it is reduced to  intermediate size by rolling, making it more readily handled.  

The rolled shape is called a bloom when its section  dimensions are 6 inches  $\times\,6$   inches or larger and square. The  section is called a billet when it is square and less than 6  inches  $\times\,6$   inches. Rectangular sections, which have a width  greater than twice their thickness, are called slabs. The slab  is the intermediate shape from which sheets are rolled.  

Blooms, billets, or slabs are heated above the critical range  and rolled into a variety of shapes of uniform cross section.  Common rolled shapes are sheet, bar, channel, angle, and  I-beam. As discussed later in this chapter, hot-rolled material  is frequently finished by cold rolling or drawing to obtain  accurate finish dimensions and a bright, smooth surface.  

Complicated sections, which cannot be rolled, or sections of  which only a small quantity is required, are usually forged.  Forging of steel is a mechanical working at temperatures  above the critical range to shape the metal as desired. Forging  is done either by pressing or hammering the heated steel until  the desired shape is obtained.  

Pressing is used when the parts to be forged are large and  heavy; this process also replaces hammering where high- grade steel is required. Since a press is slow acting, its force  is uniformly transmitted to the center of the section, thus  affecting the interior grain structure, as well as the exterior  to give the best possible structure throughout.  

Hammering can be used only on relatively small pieces. Since  hammering transmits its force almost instantly, its effect is  limited to a small depth. Thus, it is necessary to use a very  heavy hammer or to subject the part to repeated blows to  ensure complete working of the section. If the force applied  is too weak to reach the center, the finished forged surface  is concave. If the center was properly worked, the surface is  convex or bulged. The advantage of hammering is that the  operator has control over both the amount of pressure applied  and the finishing temperature and can produce small parts  of the highest grade. This type of forging is usually referred  to as smith forging. It is used extensively where only a  small number of parts are needed. Considerable machining  time and material are saved when a part is smith forged to  approximately the finished shape.  

Steel is often harder than necessary and too brittle for most  practical uses when put under severe internal strain. To relieve  such strain and reduce brittleness, it is tempered after being  hardened. This consists of heating the steel in a furnace to a  specified temperature and then cooling it in air, oil, water, or  a special solution. Temper condition refers to the condition of  metal or metal alloys with respect to hardness or toughness.  Rolling, hammering, or bending these alloys, or heat-treating  and aging them, causes them to become tougher and harder.  At times, these alloys become too hard for forming and must  be re-heat-treated or annealed.  

Metals are annealed to relieve internal stresses, soften the metal,  make it more ductile, and refine the grain structure. Annealing  consists of heating the metal to a prescribed temperature,  holding it there for a specified length of time, and then cooling  the metal back to room temperature. To produce maximum  softness, the metal must be cooled very slowly. Some metals  must be furnace cooled; others may be cooled in air.  

Normalizing applies to iron base metals only. Normalizing  consists of heating the part to the proper temperature, holding it  at that temperature until it is uniformly heated, and then cooling  it in still air. Normalizing is used to relieve stresses in metals.  

Strength, weight, and reliability are three factors that  determine the requirements to be met by any material used in  airframe construction and repair. Airframes must be strong and  yet as lightweight as possible. There are very definite limits to  which increases in strength can be accompanied by increases  in weight. An airframe so heavy that it could not support a few  hundred pounds of additional weight would be of little use.  

All metals, in addition to having a good strength-to- weight ratio, must be thoroughly reliable, thus minimizing  the possibility of dangerous and unexpected failures. In  addition to these general properties, the material selected  for a definite application must possess specific qualities  suitable for the purpose.  

The material must possess the strength required by the  dimensions, weight, and use. The five basic stresses that  metals may be required to withstand are tension, compression,  shear, bending, and torsion.  

The tensile strength of a material is its resistance to a force,  which tends to pull it apart. Tensile strength is measured in  pounds per square inch (psi) and is calculated by dividing  the load in pounds required to pull the material apart by its  cross-sectional area in square inches.  

The compression strength of a material is its resistance to  a crushing force, which is the opposite of tensile strength.  Compression strength is also measured in psi. When a piece  of metal is cut, the material is subjected, as it comes in contact  with the cutting edge, to a force known as shear. Shear is the  tendency on the part of parallel members to slide in opposite  directions. It is like placing a cord or thread between the  blades of a pair of scissors (shears). The shear strength is  the shear force in psi at which a material fails. It is the load  divided by the shear area.  

Bending can be described as the deflection or curving of a  member due to forces acting upon it. The bending strength of  material is the resistance it offers to deflecting forces. Torsion  is a twisting force. Such action would occur in a member fixed  at one end and twisted at the other. The torsional strength of  material is its resistance to twisting.  

The relationship between the strength of a material and its  weight per cubic inch, expressed as a ratio, is known as  the strength-to-weight ratio. This ratio forms the basis for  comparing the desirability of various materials for use in  airframe construction and repair. Neither strength nor weight  alone can be used as a means of true comparison. In some  applications, such as the skin of monocoque structures,  thickness is more important than strength. In this instance,  the material with the lightest weight for a given thickness  or gauge is best. Thickness or bulk is necessary to prevent  bucking or damage caused by careless handling.  

Corrosion is the eating away or pitting of the surface or the  internal structure of metals. Because of the thin sections and  the safety factors used in aircraft design and construction,  it would be dangerous to select a material possessing poor  corrosion-resistant characteristics.  

Another significant factor to consider in maintenance and  repair is the ability of a material to be formed, bent, or  machined to required shapes. The hardening of metals by  cold-working or forming is termed work hardening. If a piece  of metal is formed (shaped or bent) while cold, it is said to be  cold-worked. Practically all the work an aviation mechanic  does on metal is cold-work. While this is convenient, it causes  the metal to become harder and more brittle.  

If the metal is cold-worked too much, that is, if it is bent  back and forth or hammered at the same place too often, it  will crack or break. Usually, the more malleable and ductile  a metal is, the more cold-working it can stand. Any process  that involves controlled heating and cooling of metals to  develop certain desirable characteristics (such as hardness,  softness, ductility, tensile strength, or refined grain structure)  is called heat-treatment or heat-treating. With steels, the term  “heat-treating” has a broad meaning and includes processes  such as annealing, normalizing, hardening, and tempering.  

In the heat-treatment of aluminum alloys, only two processes  are included: the hardening and toughening process and the  softening process. The hardening and toughening process  is called heat-treating, and the softening process is called  annealing. Aircraft metals are subjected to both shock and  fatigue (vibrational) stresses. Fatigue occurs in materials that  are exposed to frequent reversals of loading or repeatedly  applied loads, if the fatigue limit is reached or exceeded.  Repeated vibration or bending ultimately causes a minute crack  to occur at the weakest point. As vibration or bending continues,  the crack lengthens until the part completely fails. This is  termed “shock and fatigue failure.” Resistance to this condition  is known as shock and fatigue resistance. It is essential that  materials used for critical parts be resistant to these stresses.  

Heat-treatment is a series of operations involving the heating  and cooling of metals in the solid state. Its purpose is to  change a mechanical property, or combination of mechanical  properties, so that the metal is more useful, serviceable, and  safe for a definite purpose. By heat-treating, a metal can be  made harder, stronger, and more resistant to impact. Heat- treating can also make a metal softer and more ductile. No one  heat-treating operation can produce all these characteristics.  In fact, some properties are often improved at the expense  of others. In being hardened, for example, a metal may  become brittle.  

The various heat-treating processes are similar in that they  all involve the heating and cooling of metals. They differ,  however, in the temperatures to which the metal is heated,  the rate at which it is cooled, and, of course, in the result.  

are hardening, tempering, normalizing, annealing, and case  hardening. Most nonferrous metals can be annealed and  many of them can be hardened by heat-treatment. However,  there is only one nonferrous metal, titanium, that can be case  hardened, and none can be tempered or normalized.  

# Internal Structure of Metals  

The results obtained by heat-treatment depend on the  structure of the metal and on the way the structure changes  when the metal is heated and cooled. A pure metal cannot  be hardened by heat-treatment, because there is little change  in its structure when heated. On the other hand, most alloys  respond to heat-treatment since their structures change with  heating and cooling.  

An alloy may be in the form of a solid solution, a mechanical  mixture, or a combination of a solid solution and a mechanical  mixture. When an alloy is in the form of a solid solution, the  elements and compounds that form the alloy are absorbed,  one into the other, in much the same way that salt is dissolved  in a glass of water, and the constituents cannot be identified  even under a microscope.  

When two or more elements or compounds are mixed but  can be identified by microscopic examination, a mechanical  mixture is formed. A mechanical mixture can be compared to  the mixture of sand and gravel in concrete. The sand and gravel  are both visible. Just as the sand and gravel are held together and  kept in place by the matrix of cement, the other constituents of  an alloy are embedded in the matrix formed by the base metal.  

An alloy in the form of a mechanical mixture at ordinary  temperatures may change to a solid solution when heated.  When cooled back to normal temperature, the alloy may  return to its original structure. On the other hand, it may  remain a solid solution or form a combination of a solid  solution and mechanical mixture. An alloy, which consists  of a combination of solid solution and mechanical mixture  at normal temperatures, may change to a solid solution when  heated. When cooled, the alloy may remain a solid solution,  return to its original structure, or form a complex solution.  

# Heat-Treating Equipment  

Successful heat-treating requires close control over all factors  affecting the heating and cooling of metals. Such control is  possible only when the proper equipment is available and  the equipment is selected to fit the job. Thus, the furnace  must be of the proper size and type and must be controlled  so that temperatures are kept within the limits prescribed  for each operation. Even the atmosphere within the furnace  affects the condition of the part being heat-treated. Further,  the quenching equipment and the quenching medium must  be selected to fit the metal and the heat-treating operation.  

Finally, there must be equipment for handling parts and  materials, for cleaning metals, and for straightening parts.  

# Furnaces & Salt Baths  

There are many different types and sizes of furnaces used in  heat-treatment. As a rule, furnaces are designed to operate in  certain specific temperature ranges and attempted use in other  ranges frequently results in work of inferior quality.  

In addition, using a furnace beyond its rated maximum  temperature shortens its life and may necessitate costly and  time-consuming repairs.  

Fuel-fired furnaces (gas or oil) require air for proper  combustion, and an air compressor or blower is therefore  necessary. These furnaces are usually of the muffler type;  that is, the combustion of the fuel takes place outside of and  around the chamber in which the work is placed. If an open  muffler is used, the furnace should be designed to prevent  the direct impingement of flame on the work.  

In furnaces heated by electricity, the heating elements are  generally in the form of wire or ribbon. Good design requires  incorporation of additional heating elements at locations  where maximum heat loss may be expected. Such furnaces  commonly operate at up to a maximum temperature of about   $2{,}000\ {\mathrm{}}^{\circ}{\mathrm{F}}.$  . Furnaces operating at temperatures up to about   ${}^{2,500}\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   usually employ resistor bars of sintered carbides.  

Temperature Measurement and Control  

A thermoelectric instrument, known as a pyrometer, measures  temperature in the heat-treating furnace. This instrument  measures the electrical effect of a thermocouple and, hence,  the temperature of the metal being treated. A complete  pyrometer consists of three parts: a thermocouple, extension  leads, and meter.  

Furnaces intended primarily for tempering may be heated by  gas or electricity and are frequently equipped with a fan for  circulating the hot air.  

Salt baths are available for operating at either tempering or  hardening temperatures. Depending on the composition of the  salt bath, heating can be conducted at temperatures as low as   $325\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to as high as  $2{,}450\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Lead baths can be used in the  temperature range of   $650\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $1{,}700\;^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The rate of heating  in lead or salt baths is much faster in furnaces.  

Heat-treating furnaces differ in size, shape, capacity,  construction, operation, and control. They may be circular  or rectangular and may rest on pedestals or directly on the  floor. There are also pit-type furnaces, which are below the  surface of the floor. When metal is to be heated in a bath of  molten salt or lead, the furnace must contain a pot or crucible  for the molten bath.  

The size and capacity of a heat-treating furnace depends  on the intended use. A furnace must be capable of heating  rapidly and uniformly, regardless of the desired maximum  temperature or the mass of the charge. An oven-type furnace  should have a working space (hearth) about twice as long and  three times as wide as any part that is heated in the furnace.  

Accurate temperature measurement is essential to good heat- treating. The usual method is by means of thermocouples: the  most common base metal couples are copper-constantan (up  to about  $700\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ), iron-constantan (up to about  ${1}{,}{400}\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ), and  chromel-alumel (up to about   ${}^{2,200}\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). The most common  noble metal couples (which can be used up to about  ${2}{,}{800}\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  are platinum coupled with either the alloy 87 percent platinum  (13 percent rhodium) or the alloy 90 percent platinum (10  percent rhodium). The temperatures quoted are for continuous  operation.  

The life of thermocouples is affected by the maximum  temperature (which may frequently exceed those given  above) and by the furnace atmosphere. Iron-constantan  is more suited for use in reducing and chromel-alumel in  oxidizing atmospheres. Thermocouples are usually encased  in metallic or ceramic tubes closed at the hot end to protect  them from the furnace gases. A necessary attachment is  an instrument, such as a millivoltmeter or potentiometer,  for measuring the electromotive force generated by the  thermocouple. In the interest of accurate control, place the  hot junction of the thermocouple as close to the work as  possible. The use of an automatic controller is valuable in  controlling the temperature at the desired value.  

Pyrometers may have meters either of the indicating type  or recording type. Indicating pyrometers give direct reading  of the furnace temperature. The recording type produces a  permanent record of the temperature range throughout the  heating operation by means of an inked stylus attached to  an arm, which traces a line on a sheet of calibrated paper or  temperature chart.  

Pyrometer installations on all modern furnaces provide  automatic regulation of the temperature at any desired setting.  Instruments of this type are called controlling potentiometer  pyrometers. They include a current regulator and an operating  mechanism, such as a relay.  

# Heating  

The object in heating is to transform pearlite (a mixture of  alternate strips of ferrite and iron carbide in a single grain) to  austenite as the steel is heated through the critical range. Since  this transition takes time, a relatively slow rate of heating  must be used. Ordinarily, the cold steel is inserted when the  temperature in the furnace is from   $300~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $500~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   below  the hardening temperature. In this way, too rapid heating  through the critical range is prevented.  

If temperature-measuring equipment is not available, it  becomes necessary to estimate temperatures by some other  means. An inexpensive, yet accurate method involves the  use of commercial crayons, pellets, or paints that melt at  various temperatures within the range of   $125\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $1{,}600\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  The least accurate method of temperature estimation is by  observation of the color of the hot hearth of the furnace or  of the work. The heat colors observed are affected by many  factors, such as the conditions of artificial or natural light, the  character of the scale on the work, and so forth. Steel begins  to appear dull red at about   $1{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}_{;}$  , and as the temperature  increases, the color changes gradually through various shades  of red to orange, to yellow, and finally to white. A rough  approximation of the correspondence between color and  temperature is indicated in  Figure 7-5 .  

It is also possible to secure some idea of the temperature of  a piece of carbon or low alloy steel, in the low temperature  range used for tempering, from the color of the thin oxide film  that forms on the cleaned surface of the steel when heated in  this range. The approximate temperature/color relationship  is indicated on the lower portion of the scale in  Figure 7-5 .  

It is often necessary or desirable to protect steel or cast iron  from surface oxidation (scaling) and loss of carbon from  the surface layers (decarburization). Commercial furnaces,  therefore, are generally equipped with some means of  atmosphere control. This usually is in the form of a burner for  burning controlled amounts of gas and air and directing the  products of combustion into the furnace muffle. Water vapor, a  product of this combustion, is detrimental and many furnaces  are equipped with a means for eliminating it. For furnaces  not equipped with atmosphere control, a variety of external  atmosphere generators are available. The gas so generated is  piped into the furnace and one generator may supply several  furnaces. If no method of atmosphere control is available,  some degree of protection may be secured by covering the  work with cast iron borings or chips. Since the liquid heating  medium surrounds the work in salt or lead baths, the problem  of preventing scaling or decarburization is simplified. Vacuum  furnaces also are used for annealing steels, especially when a  bright non-oxidized surface is a prime consideration.  

# Soaking  

The temperature of the furnace must be held constant  during the soaking period, since it is during this period that  rearrangement of the internal structure of the steel takes place.  

Soaking temperatures for various types of steel are specified  in ranges varying as much as  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  [Figure 7-6]  Small parts  are soaked in the lower part of the specified range and heavy  parts in the upper part of the specified range. The length of  the soaking period depends upon the type of steel and the size  of the part. Naturally, heavier parts require longer soaking to  ensure equal heating throughout. As a general rule, a soaking  period of 30 minutes to 1 hour is sufficient for the average  heat-treating operation.  

# Cooling  

The rate of cooling through the critical range determines the  form that the steel retains. Various rates of cooling are used to  produce the desired results. Still air is a slow cooling medium  but is much faster than furnace cooling. Liquids are the fastest  cooling media and are therefore used in hardening steels.  

There are three commonly used quenching liquids: brine,  water, and oil. Brine is the strongest quenching medium,  water is next, and oil is the least. Generally, an oil quench  is used for alloy steels and brine or water for carbon steels.  

# Quenching Media  

Quenching solutions act only through their ability to cool  the steel. They have no beneficial chemical action on  the quenched steel and in themselves impart no unusual  properties. Most requirements for quenching media are met  satisfactorily by water or aqueous solutions of inorganic salts,  such as table salt or caustic soda, or by some type of oil. The  rate of cooling is relatively rapid during quenching in brine,  somewhat less rapid in water, and slow in oil.  

Brine usually is made of a 5 to 10 percent solution of salt  (sodium chloride) in water. In addition to its greater cooling  speed, brine has the ability to “throw” the scale from steel  during quenching. Their temperature considerably affects the  cooling ability of both water and brine, particularly water.  Both should be kept cold—well below  $60\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   If the volume  of steel being quenched tends to raise the temperature of the  bath appreciably, add ice or use some means of refrigeration  to cool the quenching bath.  

There are many specially prepared quenching oils on the  market; their cooling rates do not vary widely. A straight  mineral oil with a Saybolt viscosity of about 100 at   $100\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  is generally used. Unlike brine and water, the oils have the  greatest cooling velocity at a slightly elevated temperature— about   $100{-}140~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  —because of their decreased viscosity at  these temperatures.  

When steel is quenched, the liquid in immediate contact with  the hot surface vaporizes; this vapor reduces the rate of heat  abstraction markedly. Vigorous agitation of the steel or the  use of a pressure spray quench is necessary to dislodge these  vapor films and thus permit the desired rate of cooling.  

The tendency of steel to warp and crack during the quenching  process is difficult to overcome because certain parts of  the article cool more rapidly than others. The following  recommendations greatly reduce the warping tendency.  

1.	 Never throw a part into the quenching bath. By  permitting it to lie on the bottom of the bath, it is apt  to cool faster on the topside than on the bottom side,  thus causing it to warp or crack. 2.	 Agitate the part slightly to destroy the coating of  vapor that could prevent it from cooling evenly and  rapidly. This allows the bath to dissipate its heat to the  atmosphere. 3.	 Immerse irregular shaped parts so that the heavy end  enters the bath first.  

# Quenching Equipment  

The quenching tank should be of the proper size to handle  the material being quenched. Use circulating pumps and  coolers to maintain approximately constant temperatures  when doing a large amount of quenching. To avoid building  up a high concentration of salt in the quenching tank, make  provisions for adding fresh water to the quench tank used  for molten salt baths.  

Tank location in reference to the heat-treating furnace is very  important. Situate the tank to permit rapid transfer of the part  from the furnace to the quenching medium. A delay of more  than a few seconds, in many instances, proves detrimental to  the effectiveness of the heat-treatment. During transfer to the  quench tank, employ guard sheets to retard the loss of heat  when heat-treating material of thin section. Provide a rinse  tank to remove all salt from the material after quenching if  the salt is not adequately removed in the quenching tank.  

# Heat-Treatment of Ferrous Metals  

The first important consideration in the heat-treatment of a  steel part is to know its chemical composition. This, in turn,  determines its upper critical point. When the upper critical  point is known, the next consideration is the rate of heating  and cooling to be used. Carrying out these operations involves  the use of uniform heating furnaces, proper temperature  controls, and suitable quenching mediums.  

# Behavior of Steel During Heating & Cooling  

Changing the internal structure of a ferrous metal is  accomplished by heating to a temperature above its upper  critical point, holding it at that temperature for a time  sufficient to permit certain internal changes to occur, and then  

![](images/8e8166fc31b5a34127d7f9e755738d094737bbc99071257c48610b0b12d4aedf.jpg)  

cooling to atmospheric temperature under predetermined,  controlled conditions.  

At ordinary temperatures, the carbon in steel exists in the  form of particles of iron carbide scattered throughout an iron  matrix known as “ferrite.” The number, size, and distribution  of these particles determine the hardness of the steel. At  elevated temperatures, the carbon is dissolved in the iron  matrix in the form of a solid solution called “austenite,”  and the carbide particles appear only after the steel has  been cooled. If the cooling is slow, the carbide particles are  relatively coarse and few. In this condition, the steel is soft.  If the cooling is rapid, as by quenching in oil or water, the  carbon precipitates as a cloud of very fine carbide particles,  and the steel is hard. The fact that the carbide particles can  be dissolved in austenite is the basis of the heat-treatment  of steel. The temperatures at which this transformation  takes place are called the critical points and vary with the  composition of the steel. The percent of carbon in the steel has  the greatest influence on the critical points of heat-treatment.  

# Hardening  

Pure iron, wrought iron, and extremely low carbon steels  cannot be appreciably hardened by heat-treatment, since they  contain no hardening element. Cast iron can be hardened, but  its heat-treatment is limited. When cast iron is cooled rapidly,  it forms white iron, which is hard and brittle. When cooled  slowly, it forms gray iron, which is soft but brittle under impact.  

In plain carbon steel, the maximum hardness depends  almost entirely on the carbon content of the steel. As carbon  content increases, the ability of steel to harden also increases.  However, this increase in the ability to harden with an  increase in carbon content continues only to a certain point.  In practice, that point is 0.85 percent carbon content. When  the carbon content is increased beyond 0.85 percent, there  is no increase in wear resistance.  

For most steels, the hardening treatment consists of heating  the steel to a temperature just above the upper critical point,  soaking or holding for the required length of time, and then  cooling it rapidly by plunging the hot steel into oil, water,  or brine. Although most steels must be cooled rapidly for  hardening, a few may be cooled in still air. Hardening increases  the hardness and strength of the steel but makes it less ductile.  

Carbon steel must be cooled to below   $1{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   in less than  1 second when hardening. Should the time required for the  temperature to drop to  $1{,}000\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   exceed 1 second, the austenite  begins to transform into fine pearlite. This pearlite varies  in hardness, but is much harder than the pearlite formed by  annealing and much softer than the martensite desired. After  the   $1{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   temperature is reached, the rapid cooling must  

![](images/c7f7fcf2caccf4b7f0370ae2d195e7c7760765aad8d5c03eb9a12efea558035c.jpg)  

(a) Draw at  $1,150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for tensile strength of 70,000 psi.

 (b) For spring temper draw at  $800{-}900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   Rockwell hardness C-40–45.

 (c) Bars or forgings may be quenched in water from 1,500–1,600 °F.

 (d) Air cooling from the normalizing temperature produces a tensile  strength of approximately 90,000 psi.

 (e) For spring temper draw at  $850{\mathrm{-}}950\,^{\circ}{\mathrm{F}}.$   Rockwell hardness C-40–45.

 (f ) Draw at  $350{-}450~^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$   to remove quenching strains. Rockwell hardness  C-60–65.

 (g) Anneal at   $1{,}600{-}1{,}700\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to remove residual stresses due to welding or  cold-work. May be applied only to steel containing titanium or  columbium.

 (h) Anneal at   $1{,}900{-}2{,}100\,^{\circ}\mathsf{F}$   to produce maximum softness and corrosion  resistance. Cool in air or quench in water.

 (i) Harden by cold-work only.  

(j) Lower side of range for sheet 0.06 inch and under. Middle of range for  sheet and wire 0.125 inch. Upper side of range for forgings.

 (k) Not recommended for intermediate tensile strengths because of low  impact.

 (l) AN-QQ-S-770—It is recommended that, prior to tempering,  corrosion-resisting (16 Cr-2 Ni) steel be quenched in oil from a  temperature of  $1,{\bar{8}}75{-}1,900\circ{\mathsf{F}},$   after a soaking period of 30 minutes at  this temperature. To obtain a tensile strength at 115,000 psi, the  tempering temperature should be approximately  $525\,^{\circ}\mathsf{F}.$  . A holding  time at these temperatures of about 2 hours is recommended.  Tempering temperatures between  $700\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and   $1,100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   is not approved.

 (m) Draw at approximately   $800\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and cool in air for Rockwell hardness of C-50.

 (n) Water used for quenching shall be within the temperature range of   $80{-}150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  

The time limit for the temperature drop to   $1{,}000\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   increases  above the 1 second limit for carbon steels when alloys are  added to steel. Therefore, a slower quenching medium  produces hardness in alloy steels.  

Because of the high internal stresses in the “as quenched”  condition, steel must be tempered just before it becomes  cold. The part should be removed from the quenching  bath at a temperature of approximately   $200~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , since the  temperature range from  $200\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   down to room temperature  is the cracking range.  

Hardening temperatures and quenching mediums for the  various types of steel are listed in  Figure 7-6 .  

# Hardening Precautions  

A variety of different shapes and sizes of tongs for handling  hot steels is necessary. It should be remembered that cooling  of the area contacted by the tongs is retarded and that such  areas may not harden, particularly if the steel being treated is  very shallow hardening. Small parts may be wired together  or quenched in baskets made of wire mesh.  

Special quenching jigs and fixtures are frequently used to hold  steels during quenching in a manner to restrain distortion.  

When selective hardening is desired, covering with alundum  cement or some other insulating material may protect portions  of the steel. Selective hardening may be accomplished by  using water or oil jets designed to direct quenching medium  on the areas to be hardened. This also is accomplished by  the induction and flame hardening procedures previously  described, particularly on large production jobs.  

Shallow hardening steels, such as plain carbon and certain  varieties of alloy steels, have such a high critical cooling  rate that they must be quenched in brine or water to effect  hardening. In general, intricately-shaped sections should not  be made of shallow hardening steels because of the tendency  of these steels to warp and crack during hardening. Such  items should be made of deeper hardening steels capable of  being hardened by quenching in oil or air.  

# Tempering  

Tempering reduces the brittleness imparted by hardening  and produces definite physical properties within the steel.  Tempering always follows, never precedes, the hardening  operation. In addition to reducing brittleness, tempering  softens the steel.  

Tempering is always conducted at temperatures below the  low critical point of the steel. In this respect, tempering  differs from annealing, normalizing, or hardening, all of  which require temperatures above the upper critical point.  When hardened steel is reheated, tempering begins at  $212\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  and continues as the temperature increases toward the low  critical point. By selecting a definite tempering temperature,  the resulting hardness and strength can be predetermined.  Approximate temperatures for various tensile strengths are  listed in  Figure 7-6 . The minimum time at the tempering  temperature should be 1 hour. If the part is over one inch in  thickness, increase the time by 1 hour for each additional inch  of thickness. Tempered steels used in aircraft work have from  125,000 to 200,000 psi ultimate tensile strength.  

Generally, the rate of cooling from the tempering temperature  has no effect on the resulting structure; therefore, the steel is  usually cooled in still air after being removed from the furnace.  

# Annealing  

Annealing of steel produces a fine-grained, soft, ductile metal  without internal stresses or strains. In the annealed state, steel  has its lowest strength. In general, annealing is the opposite  of hardening.  

Heating the metal to just above the upper critical point,  soaking at that temperature, and cooling very slowly in  the furnace accomplishes annealing of steel. (Refer to  Figure 7-6  for recommended temperatures.) Soaking time is  approximately 1 hour per inch of thickness of the material.  To produce maximum softness in steel, the metal must be  cooled very slowly. Slow cooling is obtained by shutting off  the heat and allowing the furnace and metal to cool together  to  $900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or lower, then removing the metal from the furnace  and cooling in still air. Another method is to bury the heated  steel in ashes, sand, or other substance that does not conduct  heat readily.  

# Normalizing  

The normalizing of steel removes the internal stresses set up  by heat-treating, welding, casting, forming, or machining.  Stress, if not controlled, leads to failure. Because of the  better physical properties, aircraft steels are often used in the  normalized state, but seldom, if ever, in the annealed state.  

One of the most important uses of normalizing in aircraft work  is in welded parts. Welding causes strains to be set up in the  adjacent material. In addition, the weld itself is a cast structure  as opposed to the wrought structure of the rest of the material.  These two types of structures have different grain sizes, and  to refine the grain as well as to relieve the internal stresses, all  welded parts should be normalized after fabrication.  

Heating the steel above the upper critical point and cooling in  still air accomplish normalizing. The more rapid quenching  obtained by air-cooling, as compared to furnace cooling,  results in a harder and stronger material than that obtained  by annealing. Recommended normalizing temperatures for  the various types of aircraft steels are listed in  Figure 7-6 .  

# Case Hardening  

Case hardening produces a hard, wear-resistant surface or  case over a strong, tough core. Case hardening is ideal for  parts that require a wear-resistant surface and, at the same  time, must be tough enough internally to withstand the  applied loads. The steels best suited to case hardening are  the low carbon and low-alloy steels. If high-carbon steel is  case hardened, the hardness penetrates the core and causes  brittleness. In case hardening, the surface of the metal is  changed chemically by introducing a high carbide or nitride  content. The core is unaffected chemically.  

When heat-treated, the surface responds to hardening while  the core toughens. The common forms of case hardening  are carburizing, cyaniding, and nitriding. Since cyaniding is  not used in aircraft work, only carburizing and nitriding are  discussed in this section.  

Carburizing  

Carburizing is a case hardening process in which carbon is  added to the surface of low-carbon steel. Thus, carburized  steel has a high-carbon surface and a low-carbon interior.  When the carburized steel is heat-treated, the case is hardened  while the core remains soft and tough.  

A common method of carburizing is called “pack carburizing.”  When carburizing is to be done by this method, the steel  parts are packed in a container with charcoal or some other  material rich in carbon. The container is then sealed with fire  clay, placed in a furnace, heated to approximately   $1{,}700\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  and soaked at that temperature for several hours. As the  temperature increases, carbon monoxide gas forms inside  the container and, being unable to escape, combines with the  gamma iron in the surface of the steel. The depth to which  the carbon penetrates depends on the length of the soaking  period. For example, when carbon steel is soaked for 8 hours,  the carbon penetrates to a depth of about 0.062 inch.  

In another method of carburizing, called “gas carburizing,”  a material rich in carbon is introduced into the furnace  atmosphere. The carburizing atmosphere is produced by  using various gases or by the burning of oil, wood, or other  materials. When the steel parts are heated in this atmosphere,  carbon monoxide combines with the gamma iron to produce  practically the same results as those described under the pack  carburizing process.  

A third method of carburizing is that of “liquid carburizing.”  In this method, the steel is placed in a molten salt bath that  contains the chemicals required to produce a case comparable  with one resulting from pack or gas carburizing.  

Alloy steels with low-carbon content, as well as low-carbon  steels, may be carburized by any of the three processes.  However, some alloys, such as nickel, tend to retard the  absorption of carbon. Thus, the time required to produce  a given thickness of case varies with the composition of  the metal.  

# Nitriding  

Nitriding is unlike other case hardening processes in that,  before nitriding, the part is heat-treated to produce definite  physical properties. Thus, parts are hardened and tempered  before being nitrided. Most steels can be nitrided, but special  alloys are required for best results. These special alloys  contain aluminum as one of the alloying elements and are  called “nitralloys.”  

In nitriding, the part is placed in a special nitriding furnace and  heated to a temperature of approximately   $1{,}000\;^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . With the  part at this temperature, ammonia gas is circulated within the  specially constructed furnace chamber. The high temperature  cracks the ammonia gas into nitrogen and hydrogen. The  ammonia, which does not break down, is caught in a water trap  below the regions of the other two gases. The nitrogen reacts  with the iron to form nitride. The iron nitride is dispersed in  minute particles at the surface and works inward. The depth  of penetration depends on the length of the treatment. Soaking  periods (as long as 72 hours) are frequently required to produce  the desired thickness during nitriding.  

Nitriding can be accomplished with a minimum of distortion,  because of the low temperature at which parts are case  hardened and because no quenching is required after exposure  to the ammonia gas.  

# Heat-Treatment of Nonferrous Metals Aluminum Alloys  

In the wrought form, commercially-pure aluminum is known  as 1100. It has a high degree of resistance to corrosion and  is easily formed into intricate shapes. It is relatively low  in strength and does not have the properties required for  structural aircraft parts. The process of alloying generally  obtains high strengths. The resulting alloys are less easily  formed and, with some exceptions, have lower resistance to  corrosion than 1100 aluminum.  

Alloying is not the only method of increasing the strength of  aluminum. Like other materials, aluminum becomes stronger  and harder as it is rolled, formed, or otherwise cold-worked.  

Since the hardness depends on the amount of cold-working  done, 1100 and some wrought aluminum alloys are available  in several strain-hardened tempers. The soft or annealed  condition is designated O. If the material is strain hardened,  it is said to be in the H condition.  

The most widely used alloys in aircraft construction are  hardened by heat-treatment rather than by cold-work.  These alloys are designated by a somewhat different set  of symbols: T4 and W indicate solution heat-treated and  quenched but not aged, and T6 indicates an alloy in the  heat-treated, hardened condition.  

•	 W—solution heat-treated, unstable temper •	 T—treated to produce stable tempers other than F, O,  or H •	 T2—annealed (cast products only) •	 T3—solution heat-treated and then cold-worked •	 T4—solution heat-treated •	 T5—artificially aged only •	 T6—solution heat-treated and then artificially aged •	 T7—solution heat-treated and then stabilized •	 T8—solution heat-treated, cold-worked, and then  artificially aged •	 T9—solution heat-treated, artificially aged, and then  cold-worked •	 T10—artificially aged and then cold-worked  

Additional digits may be added to T1 through T10 to indicate  a variation in treatment, which significantly alters the  characteristics of the product.  

Aluminum-alloy sheets are marked with the specification  number on approximately every square foot of material. If  for any reason this identification is not on the material, it is  possible to separate the heat-treatable alloys from the non- heat-treatable alloys by immersing a sample of the material  in a 10 percent solution of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide).  The heat-treatable alloys turn black due to the copper content,  whereas the others remain bright. In the case of clad material,  the surface remains bright, but there is a dark area in the  middle when viewed from the edge.  

# Alclad Aluminum  

The terms “Alclad and Pureclad” are used to designate sheets  that consist of an aluminum-alloy core coated with a layer  of pure aluminum to a depth of approximately   $5\%$   percent  on each side. The pure aluminum coating affords a dual  protection for the core, preventing contact with any corrosive  agents, and protecting the core electrolytic ally by preventing  any attack caused by scratching or from other abrasions.  

There are two types of heat-treatments applicable to  aluminum alloys: solution heat-treatment and precipitation  heat-treatment. Some alloys, such as 2017 and 2024, develop  their full properties as a result of solution heat-treatment  followed by about 4 days of aging at room temperature. Other  alloys, such as 2014 and 7075, require both heat-treatments.  

The alloys that require precipitation heat-treatment (artificial  aging) to develop their full strength also age to a limited extent  at room temperature; the rate and amount of strengthening  depends upon the alloy. Some reach their maximum natural  or room temperature aging strength in a few days, and are  designated as   $-\mathrm{T}4$   or   $-\mathrm{T}3$   temper. Others continue to age  appreciably over a long period of time.  

Because of this natural aging, the –W designation is specified  only when the period of aging is indicated, for example,  7075–W (  $\%$   hour). Thus, there is considerable difference in  the mechanical and physical properties of freshly quenched   $\mathrm{(-W)}$   material and material that is in the –T3 or  $-\mathrm{T}4$   temper. The hardening of an aluminum alloy by heat-treatment  consists of four distinct steps:  

1.	 Heating to a predetermined temperature. 2.	 Soaking at temperature for a specified length of time. 3.	 Rapidly quenching to a relatively low temperature. 4.	 Aging or precipitation-hardening either spontaneously  at room temperature, or because of a low temperature  thermal treatment.  

The first three steps above are known as solution heat-treatment,  although it has become common practice to use the shorter term,  “heat-treatment.” Room temperature hardening is known as  natural aging, while hardening done at moderate temperatures  is called artificial aging, or precipitation heat-treatment.  

# Solution Heat-Treatment  

Temperature  

The temperatures used for solution heat-treating vary with  different alloys and range from   $825\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $980~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . As a rule,  they must be controlled within a very narrow range  $(\pm10\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  to obtain specified properties.  

If the temperature is too low, maximum strength is not  obtained. When excessive temperatures are used, there is  danger of melting the low melting constituents of some  alloys with consequent lowering of the physical properties  of the alloy. Even if melting does not occur, the use of higher  than recommended temperatures promotes discoloration and  increases quenching strains.  

Time at Temperature  

The time at temperature, referred to as soaking time, is  measured from the time the coldest metal reaches the minimum  limit of the desired temperature range. The soaking time varies,  depending upon the alloy and thickness, from 10 minutes for  thin sheets to approximately 12 hours for heavy forgings. For  the heavy sections, the nominal soaking time is approximately  1 hour for each inch of cross-sectional thickness.  [Figure 7-7]  

Choose the minimum soaking time necessary to develop the  required physical properties. The effect of an abbreviated  soaking time is obvious. An excessive soaking period  aggravates high-temperature oxidation. With clad material,  prolonged heating results in excessive diffusion of copper  and other soluble constituents into the protective cladding  and may defeat the purpose of cladding.  

# Quenching  

After the soluble constituents are in solid solution, the material  is quenched to prevent or retard immediate re-precipitation.  Three distinct quenching methods are employed. The one to  be used in any instance depends upon the part, the alloy, and  the properties desired.  

# Cold Water Quenching  

Parts produced from sheet, extrusions, tubing, small forgings,  and similar type material are generally quenched in a cold  water bath. The temperature of the water before quenching  should not exceed  $85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  

Using a sufficient quantity of water keeps the temperature  rise under   $20\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Such a drastic quench ensures maximum  resistance to corrosion. This is particularly important when  working with alloys, such as 2017, 2024, and 7075. This is  the reason a drastic quench is preferred, even though a slower  quench may produce the required mechanical properties.  

# Hot Water Quenching  

Large forgings and heavy sections can be quenched in hot or  boiling water. This type of quench minimizes distortion and  alleviates cracking, which may be produced by the unequal  temperatures obtained during the quench. The use of a hot  water quench is permitted with these parts, because the  temperature of the quench water does not critically affect the  resistance to corrosion of the forging alloys. In addition, the  resistance to corrosion of heavy sections is not as critical a  factor as for thin sections.  

# Spray Quenching  

High-velocity water sprays are useful for parts formed from  clad sheet and for large sections of almost all alloys. This type  of quench also minimizes distortion and alleviates quench  cracking. However, many specifications forbid the use of  spray quenching for bare 2017 and 2024 sheet materials  because of the effect on their resistance to corrosion.  

# Lag Between Soaking & Quenching  

The time interval between the removal of the material from  the furnace and quenching is critical for some alloys and  should be held to a minimum. The elapsed time must not  exceed 10 seconds when solution heat-treating 2017 or 2024  sheet material. The allowable time for heavy sections may  be slightly greater.  

Allowing the metal to cool slightly before quenching promotes  re-precipitation from the solid solution. The precipitation  occurs along grain boundaries and in certain slip planes causing  poorer formability. In the case of 2017, 2024, and 7075 alloys,  their resistance to intergranular corrosion is adversely affected.  

# Reheat-Treatment  

The treatment of material, which has been previously  heat-treated, is considered a reheat-treatment. The unclad  heat-treatable alloys can be solution heat-treated repeatedly  without harmful effects.  

The number of solution heat-treatments allowed for clad  sheet is limited due to increased diffusion of core and  cladding with each reheating. Existing specifications allow  one to three reheat-treatments of clad sheet depending upon  cladding thickness.  

# Straightening After Solution Heat-Treatment  

Some warping occurs during solution heat-treatment,  producing kinks, buckles, waves, and twists. Straightening and  flattening operations generally remove these imperfections. Where the straightening operations produce an appreciable  increase in the tensile and yield strengths and a slight decrease  in the percent of elongation, the material is designated –T3  temper. When the above values are not materially affected,  the material is designated –T4 temper.  

# Precipitation Heat-Treating  

As previously stated, the aluminum alloys are in a  comparatively soft state immediately after quenching  from a solution heat-treating temperature. To obtain their  maximum strengths, they must be either naturally aged or  precipitation-hardened.  

During this hardening and strengthening operation,  precipitation of the soluble constituents from the super-  saturated solid solution takes place. The strength of the  material increases (often by a series of peaks) until a maximum  is reached, as precipitation progresses. Further aging, or over-  

![](images/c0bacdd9b7b4ab20ac6f7eb3720c94d7f65ea4d975bc057460f74b190b6c79ad.jpg)  

aging, causes the strength to steadily decline until a somewhat  stable condition is obtained. The submicroscopic particles that  are precipitated provide the keys or locks within the grain  structure and between the grains to resist internal slippage and  distortion when a load of any type is applied. In this manner,  the strength and hardness of the alloy are increased.  

Precipitation-hardening produces a great increase in the  strength and hardness of the material with corresponding  decreases in the ductile properties. The process used to obtain  the desired increase in strength is therefore known as aging  or precipitation-hardening.  

The strengthening of the heat-treatable alloys by aging is  not due merely to the presence of a precipitate. The strength  is due to both the uniform distribution of a finely dispersed  submicroscopic precipitate and its effects upon the crystal  structure of the alloy.  

The aging practices used depend upon many properties  other than strength. As a rule, the artificially-aged alloys are  slightly over-aged to increase their resistance to corrosion.  This is especially true with the artificially-aged, high-copper  content alloys that are susceptible to intergranular corrosion  when inadequately aged.  

The heat-treatable aluminum alloys are subdivided into  two classes: those that obtain their full strength at room  temperature and those that require artificial aging.  

The alloys that obtain their full strength after 4 or 5 days  at room temperature are known as natural-aging alloys.  Precipitation from the supersaturated solid solution starts  soon after quenching, with 90 percent of the maximum  strength generally being obtained in 24 hours. Alloys 2017  and 2024 are natural-aging alloys.  

The alloys that require precipitation thermal treatment  to develop their full strength are artificially-aged alloys.  However, these alloys also age a limited amount at room  temperature, the rate and extent of the strengthening  Many of the artificially-aged alloys reach their maximum  natural or room temperature aging strengths after a few  days. These can be stocked for fabrication in the –T4 or –T3  tempers. High zinc content alloys, such as 7075, continue to  age appreciably over a long period of time. Their mechanical  property changes being sufficient to reduce their formability.  

The advantage of –W temper formability can be utilized;  however, in the same manner as with natural-aging alloys;  that is, by fabricating shortly after solution heat-treatment or  retaining formability by using refrigeration.  

Refrigeration retards the rate of natural aging. At   $32\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  the beginning of the aging process is delayed for several  hours, while dry ice (  $-50\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $-100\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) retards aging for  an extended period of time.  

# Precipitation Practices  

The temperatures used for precipitation-hardening depend  upon the alloy and the properties desired, ranging from  $250\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  to  $375\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   They should be controlled within a very narrow  range   $(\pm5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   to obtain best results.  [Figure 7-8]  

The time at temperature is dependent upon the temperature  used, the properties desired, and the alloy. It ranges from 8  to 96 hours. Increasing the aging temperature decreases the  soaking period necessary for proper aging. However, a closer  control of both time and temperature is necessary when using  the higher temperatures.  

After receiving the thermal precipitation treatment, the  material should be air cooled to room temperature. Water  quenching, while not necessary, produces no ill effects.  Furnace cooling tends to produce over-aging.  

# Annealing of Aluminum Alloys  

The annealing procedure for aluminum alloys consists  of heating the alloys to an elevated temperature, holding  or soaking them at this temperature for a length of time  depending upon the mass of the metal, and then cooling in  still air. Annealing leaves the metal in the best condition for  cold-working. However, when prolonged forming operations  are involved, the metal takes on a condition known as  “mechanical hardness” and resists further working. It may be  necessary to anneal a part several times during the forming  process to avoid cracking. Aluminum alloys should not be  used in the annealed state for parts or fittings.  

Clad parts should be heated as quickly and carefully as  possible, since long exposure to heat tends to cause some of  the constituents of the core to diffuse into the cladding. This  

# Heat-Treatment of Aluminum Alloy Rivets  

Aluminum alloy rivets are furnished in the following  compositions: alloys 1100, 5056, 2117, 2017, and 2024.  

Alloy 1100 rivets are used in the “as fabricated” condition  for riveting aluminum alloy sheets where a low-strength rivet  is suitable. Alloy 5056 rivets are used in the “as fabricated”  condition for riveting magnesium alloy sheets.  

Alloy 2117 rivets have moderately high strength and are  suitable for riveting aluminum alloy sheets. These rivets  receive only one heat-treatment, which is performed by the  manufacturer, and are anodized after being heat-treated.  They require no further heat-treatment before they are used.  Alloy 2117 rivets retain their characteristics indefinitely after  heat-treatment and can be driven anytime. Rivets made of  this alloy are the most widely used in aircraft construction.  

Alloy 2017 and 2024 rivets are high-strength rivets suitable  for use with aluminum alloy structures. They are purchased  from the manufacturer in the heat-treated condition. Since  the aging characteristics of these alloys at room temperatures  are such that the rivets are unfit for driving, they must be  reheat-treated just before they are to be used. Alloy 2017  rivets become too hard for driving in approximately 1 hour  after quenching. Alloy 2024 rivets become hardened in 10  minutes after quenching. Both alloys may be reheat-treated  as often as required; however, they must be anodized before  the first reheat-treatment to prevent intergranular oxidation  of the material. If these rivets are stored in a refrigerator at a  temperature lower than  $32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   immediately after quenching,  they remain soft enough to be usable for several days.  

Rivets requiring heat-treatment are heated either in tubular  containers in a salt bath or in small screen wire baskets  in an air furnace. The heat-treatment of alloy 2017 rivets  consists of subjecting the rivets to a temperature between   $930~\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $950~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for approximately 30 minutes and  immediately quenching in cold water. These rivets reach  maximum strength in about 9 days after being driven. Alloy  2024 rivets should be heated to a temperature of   $910~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  to  $930~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and immediately quenched in cold water. These  rivets develop greater shear strength than 2017 rivets and  are used in locations where extra strength is required. Alloy  2024 rivets develop their maximum shear strength in 1 day  after being driven.  

The 2017 rivet should be driven within approximately 1 hour  and the 2024 rivet within 10 to 20 minutes after heat-treating  or removal from refrigeration. If not used within these times,  the rivets should be reheat-treated before being refrigerated.  

# Heat-Treatment of Magnesium Alloys  

Magnesium alloy castings respond readily to heat-treatment,  and about 95 percent of the magnesium used in aircraft  construction is in the cast form. The heat-treatment of  magnesium alloy castings is like the heat-treatment of  aluminum alloys in that there are two types of heat-treatment:  solution heat-treatment and precipitation (aging) heat- treatment. Magnesium, however, develops a negligible  change in its properties when allowed to age naturally at  room temperatures.  

# Solution Heat-Treatment  

Magnesium alloy castings are solution heat-treated to  improve tensile strength, ductility, and shock resistance. This  heat-treatment condition is indicated by using the symbol –T4  following the alloy designation. Solution heat-treatment plus  artificial aging is designated –T6. Artificial aging is necessary  to develop the full properties of the metal.  

Solution heat-treatment temperatures for magnesium alloy  castings range from   $730~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $780\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , the exact range  depending upon the type of alloy. The temperature range  for each type of alloy is listed in Specification MIL-H-6857.  The upper limit of each range listed in the specification is  the maximum temperature to which the alloy may be heated  without danger of melting the metal.  

The soaking time ranges from 10 to 18 hours, the exact time  depending upon the type of alloy as well as the thickness of the  part. Soaking periods longer than 18 hours may be necessary  for castings over 2 inches in thickness.  Never  heat magnesium  alloys in a salt bath as this may result in an explosion.  

A serious potential fire hazard exists in the heat-treatment  of magnesium alloys. If through oversight or malfunctioning  of equipment the maximum temperatures are exceeded, the  casting may ignite and burn freely. For this reason, the furnace  used should be equipped with a safety cutoff that turns off  the power to the heating elements and blowers if the regular  control equipment malfunctions or fails. Some magnesium  alloys require a protective atmosphere of sulfur dioxide  gas during solution heat-treatment. This aids in preventing  the start of a fire even if the temperature limits are slightly  exceeded.  

Air quenching is used after solution heat-treatment of  magnesium alloys since there appears to be no advantage  in liquid cooling.  

# Precipitation Heat-Treatment  

After solution treatment, magnesium alloys may be given  an aging treatment to increase hardness and yield strength.  

![Figure 7-8.   Conditions for heat-treatment of aluminum alloys. ](images/63bde1cbf93e2a4cbf4da57570994c76cd3acd6b77de47848c8695f4508bbf5b.jpg)  

Generally, the aging treatments are used merely to relieve  stress and stabilize the alloys to prevent dimensional changes  later, especially during or after machining. Both yield strength  and hardness are improved somewhat by this treatment at  the expense of a slight amount of ductility. The corrosion  resistance is also improved, making it closer to the “as cast”  alloy.  

Precipitation heat-treatment temperatures are considerably  lower than solution heat-treatment temperatures and range  from  $325\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $500\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Soaking time ranges from 4 to 18 hours.  

# Heat-Treatment of Titanium  

Titanium is heat-treated for the following purposes:  

•	 Relief of stresses set up during cold forming or  machining. •	 Annealing after hot-working or cold-working, or  to provide maximum ductility for subsequent cold-  working. •	 Thermal hardening to improve strength.  

# Stress Relieving  

Stress relieving is generally used to remove stress concentrations  resulting from forming of titanium sheet. It is performed at  temperatures ranging from   $650~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $1{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The time at  temperature varies from a few minutes for a very thin sheet to  an hour or more for heavier sections. A typical stress relieving  treatment is   $900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for 30 minutes, followed by an air cool. The discoloration or scale that forms on the surface of the  metal during stress relieving is easily removed by pickling  in acid solutions. The recommended solution contains 10 to  20 percent nitric acid and 1 to 3 percent hydrofluoric acid.  The solution should be at room temperature or slightly above.  

# Full Annealing  

The annealing of titanium and titanium alloys provides  toughness, ductility at room temperature, dimensional  and structural stability at elevated temperatures, and  improved machinability.  

The full anneal is usually called for as preparation for further  working. It is performed at 1,200 to   $1{,}650\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The time at  temperature varies from 16 minutes to several hours, depending  on the thickness of the material and the amount of cold-work  to be performed. The usual treatment for the commonly used  alloys is   $1{,}300\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for 1 hour, followed by an air cool. A full  anneal generally results in sufficient scale formation to require  the use of caustic descaling, such as sodium hydride salt bath.  

# Thermal Hardening  

Unalloyed titanium cannot be heat-treated, but the alloys  commonly used in aircraft construction can be strengthened  by thermal treatment, usually at some sacrifice in ductility.  For best results, a water quench from  $1{,}450\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}_{;}$  , followed by  reheating to   $900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for 8 hours is recommended.  

# Case Hardening  

The chemical activity of titanium and its rapid absorption of  oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon at relatively low temperatures  make case hardening advantageous for special applications.  Nitriding, carburizing, or carbonitriding can be used to produce  a wear-resistant case of 0.0001 to 0.0002 inch in depth.  

# Hardness Testing  

Hardness testing is a method of determining the results of heat- treatment, as well as the state of a metal prior to heat-treatment.  Since hardness values can be tied in with tensile strength values  and, in part, with wear resistance. Hardness tests are a valuable  Practically all hardness testing equipment now uses the  resistance to penetration as a measure of hardness. Included  among the better-known hardness testers are the Brinell and  Rockwell, both of which are described and illustrated in this  section. Also included is the Barcol tester, a popular portable- type hardness tester currently in use.  

# Brinell Tester  

The Brinell hardness tester uses a hardened spherical ball  that is forced into the surface of the metal.  [Figure 7-9]  This  ball is 10 millimeters (0.3937 inch) in diameter. A pressure of  3,000 kilograms is used for ferrous metals and 500 kilograms  for nonferrous metals. The pressure must be maintained at  least 10 seconds for ferrous metals and at least 30 seconds  for nonferrous metals. The load is applied by hydraulic  pressure. A hand pump or an electric motor, depending on the  model of tester, builds up the hydraulic pressure. A pressure  gauge indicates the amount of pressure. There is a release  mechanism for relieving the pressure after the test has been  made, and a calibrated microscope is provided for measuring  the diameter of the impression in millimeters. The machine  has various shaped anvils for supporting the specimen and  an elevating screw for bringing the specimen in contact with  the ball penetrator. These are attachments for special tests.  

To determine the Brinell hardness number for a metal,  measure the diameter of the impression using the calibrated  microscope furnished with the tester. Then convert the  measurement into the Brinell hardness number on the  conversion table furnished with the tester.  

# Rockwell Tester  

The Rockwell hardness tester measures the resistance to  penetration, as does the Brinell tester.  [Figure 7-10]  Instead  of measuring the diameter of the impression, the Rockwell  tester measures the depth, and the hardness is indicated  directly on a dial attached to the machine. The dial numbers  in the outer circle are black and the inner numbers are red.  Rockwell hardness numbers are based on the difference  between the depth of penetration at major and minor loads.  The greater this difference, the lower the hardness number  and the softer the material.  

Two types of penetrators are used with the Rockwell tester:  a diamond cone and a hardened steel ball. The load, which  forces the penetrator into the metal, is called the major load  and is measured in kilograms. The results of each penetrator  and load combination are reported on separate scales  designated by letters. The penetrator, the major load, and the  scale vary with the kind of metal being tested.  

For hardened steels, the diamond penetrator is used; the  major load is 150 kilograms; and the hardness is read on the  “C” scale. When this reading is recorded, the letter “C” must  precede the number indicated by the pointer. The C-scale  setup is used for testing metals ranging in hardness from  C-20 to the hardest steel (usually about C-70). If the metal is  softer than C-20, the B-scale setup is used. With this setup,  the  $\%$  -inch ball is used as a penetrator; the major load is 100  kilograms; and the hardness is read on the B-scale.  

In addition to the C and B scales, there are other setups for  special testing. The scales, penetrators, major loads, and dial  numbers to be read are listed in  Figure 7-11 .  

The Rockwell tester is equipped with a weight pan, and  two weights are supplied with the machine. One weight  is marked in red. The other weight is marked in black.  With no weight in the weight pan, the machine applies  a major load of 60 kilograms. If the scale setup calls for  a 100-kilogram load, the red weight is placed in the pan.  For a 150-kilogram load, the black weight is added to the  red weight. The black weight is always used with the red  weight; it is never used alone.  

Practically all testing is done with either the B-scale setup or  the C-scale setup. For these scales, the colors may be used as  a guide in selecting the weight (or weights) and in reading  the dial. For the B-scale test, use the red weight and read the  red numbers. For a C-scale test, add the black weight to the  red weight and read the black numbers.  

In setting up the Rockwell machine, use the diamond  penetrator for testing materials known to be hard. If the  hardness is unknown, try the diamond, since the steel ball  may be deformed if used for testing hard materials. If the  metal tests below C-22, then change to the steel ball.  

Use the steel ball for all soft materials, those testing less than  B-100. Should an overlap occur at the top of the B-scale and  the bottom of the C-scale, use the C-scale setup.  

Before the major load is applied, securely lock the test specimen  in place to prevent slipping and to seat the anvil and penetrator  properly. To do this, apply a load of 10 kilograms before the  lever is tripped. This preliminary load is called the minor load.  The minor load is 10 kilograms regardless of the scale setup.  

The metal to be tested in the Rockwell tester must be ground  smooth on two opposite sides and be free of scratches and  foreign matter. The surface should be perpendicular to the  axis of penetration, and the two opposite ground surfaces  should be parallel. If the specimen is tapered, the amount of  error depends on the taper. A curved surface also causes a  slight error in the hardness test. The amount of error depends  on the curvature (i.e., the smaller the radius of curvature, the  greater the error). To eliminate such error, a small flat should  be ground on the curved surface if possible.  

Clad aluminum alloy sheets cannot be tested directly  with any accuracy with a Rockwell hardness tester. If  the hardness value of the base metal is desired, the pure  aluminum coating must be removed from the area to be  checked prior to testing.  

# Barcol Tester  

The Barcol tester is a portable unit designed for testing  aluminum alloys, copper, brass, or other relatively soft  materials.  [Figure 7-12]  It should not be used on aircraft  steels. Approximate range of the tester is 25 to 100 Brinell.  The unit can be used in any position and in any space that  allows for the operator’s hand. It is of great value in the  hardness testing of assembled or installed parts, especially  to check for proper heat-treatment. The hardness is indicated  on a dial conveniently divided into 100 graduations.

Figure 7-9.   Brinell hardness tester.  

The design of the Barcol tester is such that operating  experience is not necessary. It is only necessary to exert  a light pressure against the instrument to drive the spring- loaded indenter into the material to be tested. The hardness  reading is instantly indicated on the dial.  

Several typical readings for aluminum alloys are listed in  Figure 7-13 . Note that the harder the material is, the higher  the Barcol number. To prevent damage to the point, avoid  sliding or scraping when it is in contact with the material  being tested. If the point should become damaged, it must be  replaced with a new one. Do not attempt to grind the point.  

Each tester is supplied with a test disk for checking the  condition of the point. To check the point, press the instrument  down on the test disk. When the downward pressure brings  the end of the lower plunger guide against the surface of the  disk, the indicator reading should be within the range shown  on the test disk.  

# Forging  

Forging is the process of forming a product by hammering  or pressing. When the material is forged below the  recrystallization temperature, it is called cold forged. When  worked above the recrystallization temperature, it is referred

![Figure 7-11.   Standard Rockwell hardness scales. ](images/a444eaa21dee1787d4416b1dd9c81e69db60f442e60791abbf5c50f956a83701.jpg)  

to as hot forged. Drop forging is a hammering process that  uses a hot ingot that is placed between a pair of formed dies in  a machine called a drop hammer and a weight of several tons  is dropped on the upper die. This results in the hot metal being  forced to take the form of the dies. Because the process is  very rapid, the grain structure of the metal is altered, resulting  in a significant increase in the strength of the finished part.  

# Casting  

Melting the metal and pouring it into a mold of the desired  shape forms casting. Since plastic deformation of the metal  does not occur, no alteration of the grain shape or orientation  is possible. The cooling rate, the alloys of the metal, and  the thermal treatment can control the gain size of the metal.  Castings are normally lower in strength and are more brittle  than a wrought product of the same material. For intricate  shapes or items with internal passages, such as turbine blades,  casting may be the most economical process. Except for  engine parts, most metal components found on an aircraft  are wrought instead of cast.  

All metal products start in the form of casting. Wrought  metals are converted from cast ingots by plastic deformation.  For high-strength aluminum alloys, an 80 to 90 percent  reduction (dimensional change in thickness) of the material  is required to obtain the high mechanical properties of a fully  wrought structure.  

Both iron and aluminum alloys are cast for aircraft uses. Cast  iron contains 6 to 8 percent carbon and silicon.  

Cast iron is a hard un-malleable pig iron made by casting or  pouring into a mold. Cast aluminum alloy has been heated  to its molten state and poured into a mold to give it the  desired shape.  

# Extruding  

The extrusion process involves the forcing of metal through  an opening in a die, thus causing the metal to take the shape  of the die opening. The shape of the die will be the cross  section of an angle, channel, tube, or some other shape. Some  metals, such as lead, tin, and aluminum, may be extruded  cold; however, most metals are heated before extrusion. The  main advantage of the extrusion process is its flexibility.  For example, because of its workability, aluminum can be  economically extruded to more intricate shapes and larger  sizes than is practical with other metals.  

Extruded shapes are produced in very simple, as well as  extremely complex, sections. In this process, a cylinder of  aluminum, for instance, is heated to  $750–850\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and is then  forced through the opening of a die by a hydraulic ram. The  opening is the shape desired for the cross section of the finished  extrusion. The extrusion process forms many structural parts,  such as channels, angles, T-sections, and Z-sections.  

Aluminum is the most extruded metal used in aircraft.  Aluminum is extruded at a temperature of  $700{-}900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   (371–482   $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ) and requires pressure of up to 80,000 psi   $(552\,\mathrm{MPa})$  ). After  extrusion, the product frequently is subjected to both thermal  and mechanical processes to obtain the desired properties.  Extrusion processes are limited to the more ductile materials.

# Cold-Working/Hardening  

Cold-working applies to mechanical working performed at  temperatures below the critical range. It results in a strain  hardening of the metal. In fact, the metal often becomes so  hard that it is difficult to continue the forming process without  softening the metal by annealing.  

Since the errors attending shrinkage are eliminated in cold- working, a much more compact and better metal is obtained.  The strength and hardness, as well as the elastic limit, are  increased; but the ductility decreases. Since this makes  the metal more brittle, it must be heated from time to time  during certain operations to remove the undesirable effects  of the working.  

While there are several cold-working processes, the two with  which the aviation mechanic is principally concerned are cold  rolling and cold drawing. These processes give the metals  desirable qualities that cannot be obtained by hot working.  

Cold rolling usually refers to the working of metal at room  temperature. In this operation, the materials that have been  rolled to approximate sizes are pickled to remove the scale,  after which they are passed through chilled finishing rolls.  This gives a smooth surface and brings the pieces to accurate  dimensions. The principal forms of cold-rolled stocks are  sheets, bars, and rods.  

Cold drawing is used in making seamless tubing, wire,  streamlined tie rods, and other forms of stock. Wire is made  from hot-rolled rods of various diameters. These rods are  pickled in acid to remove scale, dipped in limewater, and  then dried in a steam room where they remain until ready  for drawing. The lime coating adhering to the metal serves  as a lubricant during the drawing operation.  

The size of the rod used for drawing depends upon the  diameter wanted in the finished wire. To reduce the rod to  

![](images/d57b22ead7b7304528685de6338e1d84c0ec364d8880b8b5ef86849918fe15f3.jpg)  

the desired size, it is drawn cold through a die. One end of  the rod is filed or hammered to a point and slipped through  the die opening. Here it is gripped by the jaws of the drawing  block and pulled through the die. This series of operations is  done by a mechanism known as a draw bench.  

To reduce the rod gradually to the desired size, it is necessary  to draw the wire through successively smaller dies. Because  each of these drawings reduces the ductility of the wire, it  must be annealed from time to time before further drawings  can be accomplished. Although cold-working reduces the  ductility, it increases the tensile strength of the wire.  

In making seamless steel aircraft tubing, the tubing is cold  drawn through a ring-shaped die with a mandrel or metal bar  inside the tubing to support it while the drawing operations  are being performed. This forces the metal to flow between  the die and the mandrel and affords a means of controlling  the wall thickness and the inside and outside diameters.  

# Nonmetallic Aircraft Materials  

The use of magnesium, plastic, fabric, and wood in aircraft  construction has nearly disappeared since the mid-1950s.  Aluminum has also greatly diminished in use, from 80 percent  of airframes in 1950 to about 15 percent aluminum and  aluminum alloys today for airframe construction. Replacing  those materials are nonmetallic aircraft materials, such as  reinforced plastics and advanced composites.  

# Wood  

The earliest aircraft were constructed of wood and cloth.  Today, except for restorations and some home-built aircraft,  very little wood is used in aircraft construction.  

# Plastics  

Plastics are used in many applications throughout modern  aircraft. These applications range from structural components  of thermosetting plastics reinforced with fiberglass to  decorative trim of thermoplastic materials to windows.  

# Transparent Plastics  

Transparent plastic materials used in aircraft canopies,  such as windshields, windows and other similar transparent  enclosures, may be divided into two major classes or groups:  thermoplastic and thermosetting. These plastics are classified  according to their reaction to heat. Thermoplastic materials  soften when heated and harden when cooled. These materials  can be heated until soft and then formed into the desired  shape. When cooled, they retain this shape. The same piece  of plastic can be reheated and reshaped any number of times  without changing the chemical composition of the materials.  

Thermosetting plastics harden upon heating, and reheating  has no softening effect. These plastics cannot be reshaped  once being fully cured by the application of heat.  

In addition to the above classes, transparent plastics are  manufactured in two forms: monolithic (solid) and laminated.  Laminated transparent plastics are made from transparent  plastic face sheets bonded by an inner layer material, usually  polyvinyl butyryl. Because of its shatter resistant qualities,  laminated plastic is superior to solid plastics and is used in  many pressurized aircraft.  

Most of the transparent sheet used in aviation is manufactured  in accordance with various military specifications. A new  development in transparent plastics is stretched acrylic.  Stretched acrylic is a type of plastic, which before being  shaped, is pulled in both directions to rearrange its molecular  structure. Stretched acrylic panels have a greater resistance to  impact and are less subject to shatter; its chemical resistance  is greater, edging is simpler, and crazing and scratches are  less detrimental.  

Individual sheets of plastic are covered with a heavy masking  paper to which a pressure sensitive adhesive has been added.  This paper helps to prevent accidental scratching during  storage and handling. Be careful to avoid scratches and  gouges which may be caused by sliding sheets against one  another or across rough or dirty tables.  

If possible, store sheets in bins that are tilted at approximately   $10^{\circ}$   from vertical. If they must be stored horizontally, piles  should not be over 18 inches high, and small sheets should  be stacked on the larger ones to avoid unsupported overhang.  Store in a cool, dry place away from solvent fumes, heating  coils, radiators, and steam pipes. The temperature in the  storage room should not exceed   $120\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  

While direct sunlight does not harm acrylic plastic, it causes  drying and hardening of the masking adhesive, making  removal of the paper difficult. If the paper does not roll off  easily, place the sheet in an oven at   $250~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   for 1 minute,  maximum. The heat softens the masking adhesive for easy  removal of the paper.  

If an oven is not available, remove hardened masking paper  by softening the adhesive with aliphatic naphtha. Rub the  masking paper with a cloth saturated with naphtha. This  softens the adhesive and frees the paper from the plastic.  Sheets so treated must be washed immediately with clean  water, taking care not to scratch the surfaces.  

Note:  Aliphatic naphtha is not to be confused with aromatic  naphtha and other dry cleaning solvents, which have harmful  effects on plastic. However, aliphatic naphtha is flammable  and all precautions regarding the use of flammable liquids  must be observed.  

# Composite Materials  

In the 1940s, the aircraft industry began to develop synthetic  fibers to enhance aircraft design. Since that time, composite  materials have been used more and more. When composites  are mentioned, most people think of only fiberglass, or maybe  graphite or aramids (Kevlar). Composites began in aviation,  but now are being embraced by many other industries,  including auto racing, sporting goods, and boating, as well  as defense industry uses.  

A “composite” material is defined as a mixture of different  materials or things. This definition is so general that it could  refer to metal alloys made from several different metals to  enhance the strength, ductility, conductivity, or whatever  characteristics are desired. Likewise, the composition of  composite materials is a combination of reinforcement, such  as a fiber, whisker, or particle, surrounded and held in place by  a resin forming a structure. Separately, the reinforcement and  the resin are very different from their combined state. Even in  their combined state, they can still be individually identified  and mechanically separated. One composite, concrete, is  composed of cement (resin) and gravel or reinforcement rods  for the reinforcement to create the concrete.  

# Advantages/Disadvantages of Composites  

Some of the many advantages for using composite materials  are:  

•	 High strength-to-weight ratio •	 Fiber-to-fiber transfer of stress allowed by chemical  bonding •	 Modulus (stiffness-to-density ratio) 3.5 to 5 times that  of steel or aluminum •	 Longer life than metals •	 Higher corrosion resistance •	 Tensile strength 4 to 6 times that of steel or aluminum •	 Greater design flexibility •	 Bonded construction eliminates joints and fasteners •	 Easily repairable  

The disadvantages of composites include:  

•	 Inspection methods difficult to conduct, especially  delamination detection (Advancements in technology  will eventually correct this problem.) •	 Lack of long-term design database, relatively new  technology methods •	 Cost  

•	 Very expensive processing equipment •	 Lack of standardized system of methodology •	 Great variety of materials, processes, and techniques •	 General lack of repair knowledge and expertise •	 Products often toxic and hazardous •	 Lack of standardized methodology for construction  and repairs  

The increased strength and the ability to design for the  performance needs of the product makes composites much  superior to the traditional materials used in today’s aircraft.  As more and more composites are used, the costs, design,  inspection ease, and information about strength-to-weight  advantages help composites become the material of choice  for aircraft construction.  

# Composite Safety  

Composite products can be very harmful to the skin, eyes,  and lungs. In the long or short term, people can become  sensitized to the materials with serious irritation and health  issues. Personal protection is often uncomfortable, hot, and  difficult to wear; however, a little discomfort while working  with the composite materials can prevent serious health issues  or even death.  

Respirator particle protection is very important to protecting  the lungs from permanent damage from tiny glass bubbles  and fiber pieces. At a minimum, a dust mask approved for  fiberglass is a necessity. The best protection is a respirator  with dust filters. The proper fit of a respirator or dust mask is  very important, because if the air around the seal is breathed,  the mask cannot protect the wearer’s lungs. When working  with resins, it is important to use vapor protection. Charcoal  filters in a respirator remove the vapors for a period of time.  When removing the respirator for breaks, and upon placing  the mask back on, if you can smell the resin vapors, replace  the filters immediately. Sometimes, charcoal filters last less  than 4 hours. Store the respirator in a sealed bag when not in  use. If working with toxic materials for an extended period,  a supplied air mask and hood are recommended.  

Avoid skin contact with the fibers and other particles by  wearing long pants and long sleeves along with gloves or  barrier creams. The eyes must be protected using leak-proof  goggles (no vent holes) when working with resins or solvents,  because chemical damage to the eyes is usually irreversible.  

# Fiber Reinforced Materials  

The purpose of reinforcement in reinforced plastics is to  provide most of the strength. The three main forms of fiber  reinforcements are particles, whiskers, and fibers.  

A particle is a square piece of material. Glass bubbles (Q-cell)  are hollow glass spheres, and since their dimensions are equal  on all axes, they are called a particle.  

A whisker is a piece of material that is longer than it is wide.  Whiskers are usually single crystals. They are very strong  and used to reinforce ceramics and metals.  

Fibers are single filaments that are much longer than they  are wide. Fibers can be made of almost any material and are  not crystalline like whiskers. Fibers are the base for most  composites. Fibers are smaller than the finest human hair  and are normally woven into cloth-like materials.  

# Laminated Structures  

Composites can be made with or without an inner core of  material. Laminated structure with a core center is called  a sandwich structure. Laminate construction is strong and  stiff, but heavy. The sandwich laminate is equal in strength,  and its weight is much less; less weight is very important to  aerospace products.  

The core of a laminate can be made from nearly anything. The  decision is normally based on use, strength, and fabricating  methods to be used.  

Various types of cores for laminated structures include rigid  foam, wood, metal, or the aerospace preference of honeycomb  made from paper, Nomex  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$  , carbon, fiberglass, or metal.  Figure 7-14  shows a typical sandwich structure. It is very  important to follow proper techniques to construct or repair  laminated structures to ensure the strength is not compromised.  Taking a high-density laminate or solid face and back plate and  sandwiching a core in the middle make a sandwich assembly.  The design engineer, depending on the intended application  of the part, decides the selection of materials for the face  and the back plate. It is important to follow manufacturers’  maintenance manual specific instructions regarding testing  and repair procedures as they apply to a particular aircraft.  

# Reinforced Plastic  

Reinforced plastic is a thermosetting material used in the  manufacture of radomes, antenna covers, and wingtips, and as  insulation for various pieces of electrical equipment and fuel  cells. It has excellent dielectric characteristics that make it  ideal for radomes; however, its high strength-to-weight ratio,  resistance to mildew, rust, and rot, and ease of fabrication  make it equally suited for other parts of the aircraft.  

Reinforced plastic components of aircraft are formed of either  solid laminates or sandwich-type laminates. Resins used  to impregnate glass cloths are of the contact pressure type  (requiring little or no pressure during cure). These resins are  supplied as a liquid, which can vary in viscosity from water  like consistency to thick syrup. Cure or polymerization is  affected by the use of a catalyst, usually benzoyl peroxide.  

Solid laminates are constructed of three or more layers of  resin impregnated cloths “wet laminated” together to form  a solid sheet facing or molded shape.  

Sandwich-type laminates are constructed of two or more  solid sheet facings or a molded shape enclosing a fiberglass  honeycomb or foam-type core. Honeycomb cores are made  of glass cloths impregnated with polyester or a combination  of nylon and phenolic resins. The specific density and cell  size of honeycomb cores varies over considerable latitude.  Honeycomb cores are normally fabricated in blocks that are  later cut to the desired thickness on a band saw.  

Foam-type cores are formulated from combinations of  alkyd resins and metatoluene di-isocyanate. Sandwich-  type fiberglass components filled with foam-type cores are  manufactured to exceedingly close tolerances on overall  thickness of the molded facing and core material. To achieve  this accuracy, the resin is poured into a close tolerance,  molded shape. The resin formulation immediately foams up  to fill the void in the molded shape and forms a bond between  the facing and the core.  

# Rubber  

Rubber is used to prevent the entrance of dirt, water, or air,  and to prevent the loss of fluids, gases, or air. It is also used  to absorb vibration, reduce noise, and cushion impact loads. The term “rubber” is as all-inclusive as the term “metal.” It is  used to include not only natural rubber, but also all synthetic  and silicone rubbers.  

# Natural Rubber  

Natural rubber has better processing and physical properties  than synthetic or silicone rubber. These properties include  flexibility, elasticity, tensile strength, tear strength, and low  heat buildup due to flexing (hysteresis). Natural rubber is a  general-purpose product; however, its suitability for aircraft  use is somewhat limited because of its inferior resistance  to most influences that cause deterioration. Although it  provides an excellent seal for many applications, it swells  and often softens in all aircraft fuels and in many solvents  (naphthas and so forth). Natural rubber deteriorates more  rapidly than synthetic rubber. It is used as a sealing material  for water/methanol systems.  

# Synthetic Rubber  

Synthetic rubber is available in several types, each of which  is compounded of different materials to give the desired  properties. The most widely used are the butyls, Bunas,  and neoprene.  

Butyl is a hydrocarbon rubber with superior resistance to gas  permeation. It is also resistant to deterioration; however, its  comparative physical properties are significantly less than  those of natural rubber. Butyl resists oxygen, vegetable oils,  animal fats, alkalies, ozone, and weathering.  

Like natural rubber, butyl swells in petroleum or coal  tar solvents. It has a low water absorption rate and good  resistance to heat and low temperature. Depending on  the grade, it is suitable for use in temperatures ranging  from   $-65\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $300\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   Butyl is used with phosphate ester  hydraulic fluids (Skydrol™), silicone fluids, gases, ketones,  and acetones.  

Buna-S rubber resembles natural rubber both in processing and  performance characteristics. Buna-S is as water resistant as  natural rubber, but has somewhat better aging characteristics.  It has good resistance to heat, but only in the absence of severe  flexing. Generally, Buna-S has poor resistance to gasoline, oil,  concentrated acids, and solvents. Buna-S is normally used for  tires and tubes as a substitute for natural rubber.  

Buna-N is outstanding in its resistance to hydrocarbons and  other solvents; however, it has poor resilience in solvents at  low temperature. Buna-N compounds have good resistance  to temperatures up to  $300~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and may be procured for low  temperature applications down to   $-75\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Buna-N has fair  tear, sunlight, and ozone resistance. It has good abrasion  resistance and good breakaway properties when used in  contact with metal. When used as a seal on a hydraulic piston,  it does not stick to the cylinder wall. Buna-N is used for oil  and gasoline hoses, tank linings, gaskets, and seals.  

Neoprene can take more punishment than natural rubber  and has better low-temperature characteristics. It possesses  exceptional resistance to ozone, sunlight, heat, and aging.  Neoprene looks and feels like rubber. Neoprene, however,  is less like rubber in some of its characteristics than butyl  or Buna. The physical characteristics of neoprene, such as  tensile strength and elongation, are not equal to natural rubber  but do have a definite similarity. Its tear resistance, as well  as its abrasion resistance, is slightly less than that of natural  rubber. Although its distortion recovery is complete, it is not  as rapid as natural rubber.  

Neoprene has superior resistance to oil. Although it is good  material for use in nonaromatic gasoline systems, it has poor  resistance to aromatic gasoline. Neoprene is used primarily  for weather seals, window channels, bumper pads, oil resistant  hose, and carburetor diaphragms. It is also recommended for  

![](images/2ae36ff36cb316400492f588d626acbf57938bac214d7719d73ee5afb5332733.jpg)  
Figure 7-14.   Sandwich structure.  

use with Freon™ and silicate ester lubricants.  

Thiokol, known also as polysulfide rubber, has the highest  resistance to deterioration but ranks the lowest in physical  properties. Petroleum, hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols,  gasoline, or water, in general, does not seriously affect  Thiokols. Thiokols are ranked low in such physical properties  as compression set, tensile strength, elasticity, and tear  abrasion resistance. Thiokol is used for oil hoses, tank linings  for aromatic aviation gasoline, gaskets, and seals.  

Silicone rubbers are a group of plastic rubber materials made  from silicon, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. The silicones have  excellent heat stability and very low temperature flexibility.  They are suitable for gaskets, seals, or other applications where  elevated temperatures up to   $600\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   are prevalent. Silicone  rubbers are also resistant to temperatures down to   $-150\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  Throughout this temperature range, silicone rubber remains  extremely flexible and useful with no hardness or gumminess.  Although this material has good resistance to oils, it reacts  unfavorably to both aromatic and nonaromatic gasoline.  

Silastic, one of the best-known silicones, is used to insulate  electrical and electronic equipment. Because of its dielectric  properties over a wide range of temperatures, it remains  flexible and free from crazing and cracking. Silastic is also  used for gaskets and seals in certain oil systems.  

# Shock Absorber Cord  

Shock absorber cord is made from natural rubber strands  encased in a braided cover of woven cotton cords treated to  resist oxidation and wear. Great tension and elongation are  obtained by weaving the jacket upon the bundle of rubber  strands while they are stretched about three times their  original length.  

There are two types of elastic shock absorbing cord. Type I  is a straight cord, and type II is a continuous ring known as  a “bungee.” The advantages of the type II cord are that it is  easily and quickly replaced and does not need to be secured  by stretching and whipping. Shock cord is available in  standard diameters from  $\%$   inch to   ${}^{13}\!\!\sqrt{}_{16}$   inch.  

Three colored threads are braided into the outer cover for  the entire length of the cord. Two of these threads are of the  same color and represent the year of manufacture; the third  thread, a different color, represents the quarter of the year in  which the cord was made. The code covers a 5-year period  and then repeats itself. This makes it easy to figure forward  or backward from the years shown in  Figure 7-15 .  

# Seals  

Seals are used to prevent fluid from passing a certain point,  as well as to keep air and dirt out of the system in which they  are used. The increased use of hydraulics and pneumatics in  aircraft systems has created a need for packings and gaskets  of varying characteristics and design to meet the many  variations of operating speeds and temperatures to which they  are subjected. No one style or type of seal is satisfactory for  all installations. Some of the reasons for this are:  

•	 Pressure at which the system operates  •	 Type fluid used in the system •	 Metal finish and the clearance between adjacent parts  •	 Type motion (rotary or reciprocating), if any  

Seals are divided into three main classes: packings, gaskets,  and wipers.  

# Packings  

Packings are made of synthetic or natural rubber. They  are generally used as “running seals,” that is, in units that  contain moving parts, such as actuating cylinders, pumps,  selector valves, and so forth. Packings are made in the form  of O-rings, V-rings, and U-rings, each designed for a specific  purpose.  [Figure 7-16]  

# O-Ring Packings  

O-ring packings are used to prevent both internal and  external leakage. This type of packing ring seals effectively  in both directions and is the type most commonly used. In  installations subject to pressures above 1,500 psi, backup  rings are used with O-rings to prevent extrusion.  

When O-ring packing is subjected to pressure from both sides,  as in actuating cylinders, two backup rings must be used (one  on either side of the O-ring). When an O-ring is subject to  pressure on only one side, a single backup ring is generally  used. In this case, the backup ring is always placed on the  side of the O-ring away from the pressure.  

The materials from which O-rings are manufactured have been  compounded for various operating conditions, temperatures,  and fluids. An O-ring designed specifically for use as a static  (stationary) seal, probably will not do the job when installed  on a moving part, such as a hydraulic piston. Most O-rings  are similar in appearance and texture, but their characteristics  may differ widely. An O-ring is useless if it is not compatible  with the system fluid and operating temperature.  

Advances in aircraft design have necessitated new O-ring  compositions to meet changed operating conditions. Hydraulic  O-rings were originally established under AN specification  numbers (6227, 6230, and 6290) for use in MIL-H-5606 fluid  at temperatures ranging from  $-65\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $+160\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . When new  designs raised operating temperatures to a possible   $275\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$    more compounds were developed and perfected.  

Recently, a compound was developed that offered improved  low-temperature performance without sacrificing high- temperature performance, rendering the other series obsolete.  This superior material was adopted in the MS28775 series.  This series is now the standard for MIL-H-5606 systems in  which the temperature may vary from  $-65\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $+275\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  .  

Manufacturers provide color-coding on some O-rings, but this  is not a reliable or complete means of identification. The color- coding system does not identify sizes but only system fluid  or vapor compatibility and, in some cases, the manufacturer.  Color codes on O-rings that are compatible with MIL-H-5606  fluid always contains blue but may also contain red or other  colors. Packings and gaskets suitable for use with Skydrol™  fluid is always coded with a green stripe, but may also have a  blue, grey, red, green, or yellow dot as a part of the color code.  Color codes on O-rings that are compatible with hydrocarbon  fluid always contains red but never contain blue. A colored  stripe around the circumference indicates that the O-ring  is a boss gasket seal. The color of the stripe indicates fluid  compatibility: red for fuel, blue for hydraulic fluid.  

The coding on some rings is not permanent. On others  it may be omitted due to manufacturing difficulties or  interference with operation. Furthermore, the color-coding  system provides no means to establish the age of the O-ring  or its temperature limitations.  

Because of the difficulties with color-coding, O-rings  are available in individual hermetically-sealed envelopes  labeled with all pertinent data. When selecting an O-ring for  installation, the basic part number on the sealed envelope  provides the most reliable compound identification.  

Although an O-ring may appear perfect at first glance, slight  surface flaws may exist. These flaws are often capable of  preventing satisfactory O-ring performance under the variable  operating pressures of aircraft systems; therefore, O-rings  

![Figure 7-15.   Shock absorber cord color coding. ](images/a430a9d34e7dfd65636c3e7d442e3c662c662436e264c12e88a72fd7325d117a.jpg)  

should be rejected for flaws that affect their performance.  Such flaws are difficult to detect, and one aircraft manufacturer  recommends using a 4-power magnifying glass with adequate  lighting to inspect each ring before it is installed.  

By rolling the ring on an inspection cone or dowel, the  inner diameter surface can also be checked for small cracks,  particles of foreign material, or other irregularities that cause  leakage or shorten the life of the O-ring. The slight stretching  of the ring when it is rolled inside out helps to reveal some  defects not otherwise visible.  

# Backup Rings  

Backup rings (MS28782) made of Teflon™ do not deteriorate  with age, are unaffected by any system fluid or vapor, and can  tolerate temperature extremes in excess of those encountered  in high-pressure hydraulic systems. Their dash numbers  indicate not only their size but also relate directly to the dash  number of the O-ring for which they are dimensionally suited.  They are procurable under several basic part numbers, but  they are interchangeable; that is, any Teflon™ backup ring  may be used to replace any other Teflon™ backup ring if it is  of proper overall dimension to support the applicable O-ring.  Backup rings are not color-coded or otherwise marked and  must be identified from package labels.  

The inspection of backup rings should include a check to  ensure that surfaces are free from irregularities, that the edges  are clean cut and sharp, and that scarf cuts are parallel. When  checking Teflon™ spiral backup rings, make sure that the  coils do not separate more than   $\%$   inch when unrestrained.

Figure 7-16.   Packing rings.  

# V-Ring Packings  

V-ring packings (AN6225) are one-way seals and are always  installed with the open end of the “V” facing the pressure.  V-ring packings must have a male and female adapter to  hold them in the proper position after installation. It is also  necessary to torque the seal retainer to the value specified  by the manufacturer of the component being serviced, or the  seal may not give satisfactory service. An installation using  V-rings is shown in  Figure 7-17 .  

# U-Ring Packings  

U-ring packings (AN6226) and U-cup packings are used in  brake assemblies and brake master cylinders. The U-ring and  U-cup seal pressure in only one direction; therefore, the lip of  the packings must face toward the pressure. U-ring packings  are primarily low-pressure packings to be used with pressures  of less than 1,000 psi.  

# Gaskets  

Gaskets are used as static (stationary) seals between two  flat surfaces. Some of the more common gasket materials  are asbestos, copper, cork, and rubber. Asbestos sheeting  is used wherever a heat-resistant gasket is needed. It is  used extensively for exhaust system gaskets. Most asbestos  exhaust gaskets have a thin sheet of copper edging to  prolong their life.  

A solid copper washer is used for spark plug gaskets where it  is essential to have a non-compressible, yet semisoft gasket.  Cork gaskets can be used as an oil seal between the engine  crankcase and accessories, and where a gasket is required that  can occupy an uneven or varying space caused by a rough  surface or expansion and contraction.  

Rubber sheeting can be used where there is a need for a  compressible gasket. It should not be used in any place  where it may come in contact with gasoline or oil because  the rubber deteriorates very rapidly when exposed to these  substances. Gaskets are used in fluid systems around the  end caps of actuating cylinders, valves, and other units. The  gasket generally used for this purpose is in the shape of an  O-ring, similar to O-ring packings.  

# Wipers  

Wipers are used to clean and lubricate the exposed portions  of piston shafts. They prevent dirt from entering the system  and help protect the piston shaft against scoring. Wipers may  be either metallic or felt. They are sometimes used together,  a felt wiper installed behind a metallic wiper.  

# Sealing Compounds  

Certain areas of all aircraft are sealed to withstand  pressurization by air, to prevent leakage of fuel, to prevent  passage of fumes, or to prevent corrosion by sealing against  the weather. Most sealants consist of two or more ingredients  properly proportioned and compounded to obtain the best  results. Some materials are ready for use as packaged, but  others require mixing before application.  

# One Part Sealants  

One part sealants are prepared by the manufacturer and are  ready for application as packaged. However, the consistency  of some of these compounds may be altered to satisfy a  particular method of application. If thinning is desired, use  the thinner recommended by the sealant manufacturer.  

# Two Part Sealants  

Two part sealants are compounds requiring separate  packaging to prevent cure prior to application and are  identified as the base sealing compound and the accelerator.  Any alteration of the prescribed ratios reduces the quality of  the material. Combining equal portions, by weight, of base  compound and accelerator, mixes two part sealants.  

All sealant material should be carefully weighed in accordance  with the sealant manufacturer’s recommendations. Sealant  material is usually weighed with a balance scale equipped  with weights specially prepared for various quantities of  sealant and accelerator.  

Before weighing the sealant materials, thoroughly stir both  the base sealant compound and the accelerator. Do not use  accelerator, which is dried out, lumpy, or flaky. Pre-weighed  sealant kits do not require weighing of the sealant and  accelerator before mixing when the entire quantity is to be  mixed.  

After determining the proper amount of base sealant  compound and accelerator, add the accelerator to the  base sealant compound. Immediately after adding the  accelerator, thoroughly mix the two parts by stirring or  folding, depending on the consistency of the material.  Carefully mix the material to prevent entrapment of air in  the mixture. Overly rapid or prolonged stirring builds up  heat in the mixture and shortens the normal application time  (working life) of the mixed sealant.  

To ensure a well-mixed compound, test by smearing a small  portion on a clean, flat metal, or glass surface. If flecks or  lumps are found, continue mixing. If the flecks or lumps  cannot be eliminated, reject the batch.  

The working life of mixed sealant is from  $\%$   hour to 4 hours  (depending upon the class of sealant); therefore, apply  mixed sealant as soon as possible or place in refrigerated  storage.  Figure 7-18  presents general information  

![](images/914738b661c0dcb3105ad558ea2865767c8b73dea0d590d1f16e4890d6d7243d.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.   V-ring installation.  

concerning various sealants.  

The curing rate of mixed sealants varies with changes in  temperature and humidity. Curing of sealants is extremely slow  if the temperature is below  $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   A temperature of  $77\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   with  50 percent relative humidity is the ideal condition for curing  most sealants.  

Curing may be accelerated by increasing the temperature, but  the temperature should never be allowed to exceed   $120\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   at  any time in the curing cycle. Heat may be applied by using  infrared lamps or heated air. If heated air is used, it must be  properly filtered to remove moisture and dirt.  

Heat should not be applied to any faying surface sealant  installation until all work is completed. All faying surface  applications must have all attachments, permanent or  temporary, completed within the application limitations of  the sealant.  

Sealant must be cured to a tack-free condition before applying  brush top coatings. (Tack-free consistency is the point at  which a sheet of cellophane pressed onto the sealant no  longer adheres.)  

# Aircraft Hardware  

Aircraft hardware is the term used to describe the various  types of fasteners and miscellaneous small items used in  the manufacture and repair of aircraft. The importance of  aircraft hardware is often overlooked because of its small  size; however, the safe and efficient operation of any aircraft  is greatly dependent upon the correct selection and use of  aircraft hardware.  

An aircraft, even though made of the best materials and  strongest parts, would be of doubtful value unless those parts  were firmly held together. Several methods are used to hold  metal parts together; they include riveting, bolting, brazing,  and welding. The process used must produce a union that is  as strong as the parts that are joined.  

# Identification  

Their specification number or trade name identifies most  items of aircraft hardware. Threaded fasteners and rivets are  identified by AN (Air Force-Navy) numbers, NAS (National  Aircraft Standard) numbers, or MS (Military Standard)  numbers. Quick-release fasteners are usually identified by  factory trade names and size designations.  

# Threaded Fasteners  

Various types of fastening devices allow quick dismantling  or replacement of aircraft parts that must be taken apart and  put back together at frequent intervals. Riveting or welding  these parts each time they are serviced would soon weaken  or ruin the joint. Furthermore, some joints require greater  tensile strength and stiffness than rivets can provide. Bolts  and screws are two types of fastening devices that give the  required security of attachment and rigidity. Generally, bolts  are used where great strength is required, and screws are used  where strength is not the deciding factor. Bolts and screws  are similar in many ways. They are both used for fastening  or holding, and each has a head on one end and screw threads  on the other. Regardless of these similarities, there are several  distinct differences between the two types of fasteners. The  threaded end of a bolt is always blunt while that of a screw  may be either blunt or pointed.  

The threaded end of a bolt usually has a nut screwed onto it  to complete the assembly. The threaded end of a screw may  fit into a female receptacle, or it may fit directly into the  material being secured. A bolt has a short threaded section  and a comparatively long grip length or unthreaded portion,  whereas a screw has a longer threaded section and may have  no clearly defined grip length. Turning the nut on the bolt  generally tightens a bolt assembly; the head of the bolt may  or may not be designed for turning. Turning its head always  tightens a screw.  

When it becomes necessary to replace aircraft fasteners, a  duplicate of the original fastener should be used if possible.  If duplicate fasteners are not available, extreme care and  caution must be used in selecting substitutes.  

# Classification of Threads  

Aircraft bolts, screws, and nuts are threaded in the American  National Coarse (NC) thread series, the American National  Fine (NF) thread series, the American Standard Unified  Coarse (UNC) thread series, or the American Standard  Unified Fine (UNF) thread series. There is one difference  between the American National series and the American  Standard Unified series that should be pointed out. In the  1-inch diameter size, the NF thread specifies 14 threads per  inch   $(1{\cdot}14~\mathrm{NF})$  ), while the UNF thread specifies 12 threads  per inch (1-12 UNF). Both types of threads are designated  by the number of times the incline (threads) rotates around a  1-inch length of a given diameter bolt or screw. For example,  a 1/4-28 thread indicates that a  $\%$  -inch ( 4 ⁄  inch) diameter bolt  16 has 28 threads in 1 inch of its threaded length.  

Class of fit also designates threads. The Class of a thread  indicates the tolerance allowed in manufacturing:  

•	 Class 1 is a loose fit  •	 Class 2 is a free fit •	 Class 3 is a medium fit  •	 Class 4 is a close fit  

Aircraft bolts are almost always manufactured in the Class  3, medium fit.  

A Class 4 fit requires a wrench to turn the nut onto a bolt,  whereas a Class 1 fit can easily be turned by hand. Generally,  aircraft screws are manufactured with a Class 2 thread fit for  ease of assembly.  

Bolts and nuts are also produced with right-hand and left-hand  threads. A right-hand thread tightens when turned clockwise;  a left-hand thread tightens when turned counterclockwise.  

# Aircraft Bolts  

Aircraft bolts are fabricated from cadmium- or zinc-plated  corrosion-resistant steel, un-plated corrosion-resistant steel,  or anodized-aluminum alloys. Most bolts used in aircraft  structures are either general purpose, AN bolts, NAS  internal wrenching or close tolerance bolts, or MS bolts. In  certain cases, aircraft manufacturers make bolts of different  dimensions or greater strength than the standard types. Such  bolts are made for a particular application, and it is of extreme  importance to use like bolts in replacement. The letter “S”  stamped on the head usually identifies special bolts.  

AN bolts come in three head styles: hex head, Clevis, and  eyebolt.  [Figure 7-19]  NAS bolts are available in hex head,  internal wrenching, and countersunk head styles. MS bolts  come in hex head and internal wrenching styles.  

# General Purpose Bolts  

The hex head aircraft bolt (AN-3 through AN-20) is an  all-purpose structural bolt used for general applications  involving tension or shear loads where a light drive fit is  permissible (0.006-inch clearance for a   $\%$  -inch hole and  

![](images/1c4eed60c6d39af54d3dbf3bde9a0131e72fb799cf2da7bfcf8aa32a39544b82.jpg)  

other sizes in proportion).  

Alloy-steel bolts smaller than No. 10-32 and aluminum- alloy bolts smaller than  $\%$   inch in diameter are not used in  primary structures. Aluminum-alloy bolts and nuts are not  used where they are repeatedly removed for purposes of  maintenance and inspection. Aluminum-alloy nuts may be  used with cadmium-plated steel bolts loaded in shear on land  airplanes, but are not used on seaplanes due to the increased  possibility of dissimilar metal corrosion.  

The AN-73 drilled head bolt is like the standard hex  bolt, but has a deeper head, which is drilled to receive  wire for safetying. The AN-3 and the AN-73 series bolts  are interchangeable, for all practical purposes, from the  standpoint of tension and shear strengths.  

# Close Tolerance Bolts  

Close tolerance bolts are machined more accurately than the  general-purpose bolt. Close tolerance bolts may be hex headed 

 (AN-173 through AN-186) or have a   $100^{\circ}$   countersunk head 

 (NAS-80 through NAS-86). They are used in applications  where a tight drive fit is required. (The bolt moves into position  only when struck with a 12- to 14-ounce hammer.)  

# Internal Wrenching Bolts  

NAS-495) are fabricated from high-strength steel and are  suitable for use in both tension and shear applications. When  they are used in steel parts, the bolt hole must be slightly  countersunk to seat the large corner radius of the shank at  the head. In Dural material, a special heat-treated washer  must be used to provide an adequate bearing surface for the  head. The head of the internal wrenching bolt is recessed to  allow the insertion of an internal wrench when installing or  removing the bolt. Special high-strength nuts are used on  these bolts. Replace an internal wrenching bolt with another  internal wrenching bolt. Standard AN hex head bolts and  washers cannot be substituted for them, as they do not have  the required strength.  

# Identification and Coding  

Bolts are manufactured in many shapes and varieties. A  clear-cut method of classification is difficult. The shape of  the head, method of securing, material used in fabrication,  or the expected usage can identify bolts.  

AN-type aircraft bolts can be identified by the code markings  on the bolt heads. The markings generally denote the bolt  manufacturer, the material used to make the bolt, and whether  the bolt is a standard AN-type or a special purpose bolt.  

•	 AN standard steel bolts are marked with either a raised  Internal wrenching bolts, (MS-20004 through MS-20024 or  

dash or asterisk or a single raised dash.  •	 AN aluminum-alloy bolts are marked with two raised  dashes to indicate corrosion-resistant steel.  •	 Additional information, such as bolt diameter, bolt  length, and grip length, may be obtained from the bolt  part number.  

For example, in the bolt part number AN3DD5A,  

•	 The “AN” designates that it is an Air Force-Navy  standard bolt.  •	 The “3” indicates the diameter in sixteenths of an inch  ( 3 ⁄ ). 16 •	 The “DD” indicates the material is 2024 aluminum  alloy.  •	 The letter “C” in place of the “DD” would indicate  corrosion-resistant steel, and the absence of the letters  would indicate cadmium-plated steel.  •	 The “  $\cdot5"$   indicates the length in eighths of an inch   $(\%)$  .  •	 the “A” indicates that the shank is undrilled. If the  letter “H” preceded the   $\left.\right.:5^{\circ}$   in addition to the “A”  following it, the head would be drilled for safetying.  

Close tolerance NAS bolts are marked with either a raised  or recessed triangle. The material markings for NAS bolts  are the same as for AN bolts, except that they may be either  raised or recessed. Bolts inspected magnetically (Magnaflux)  or by fluorescent means (Zyglo) are identified by means of  colored lacquer or a head marking of a distinctive type.  

# Special-Purpose Bolts  

Bolts designed for a particular application or use is classified  as special-purpose bolts. Clevis bolts, eyebolts, Jo-bolts, and  lockbolts are special-purpose bolts.  

# Clevis Bolts  

The head of a Clevis bolt is round and is either slotted to  receive a common screwdriver or recessed to receive a cross  point screwdriver. This type of bolt is used only where shear  loads occur and never in tension. It is often inserted as a  mechanical pin in a control system.  

# Eyebolt  

The eyebolt is a special-purpose bolt used where external  tension loads are to be applied. The eyebolt is designed for  the attachment of devices, such as the fork of a turnbuckle,  a Clevis, or a cable shackle. The threaded end may or may  not be drilled for safetying.  

# Jo-Bolt  

rivet. The Jo-bolt consists of three parts: a threaded steel-alloy  bolt, a threaded steel nut, and an expandable stainless steel  sleeve. The parts are factory preassembled. As the Jo-bolt is  installed, the bolt is turned while the nut is held. This causes  the sleeve to expand over the end of the nut, forming the  blind head and clamping against the work. When driving is  complete, a portion of the bolt breaks off. The high shear and  tensile strength of the Jo-bolt makes it suitable for use in cases  of high stresses where some of the other blind fasteners would  not be practical. Jo-bolts are often a part of the permanent  structure of late model aircraft. They are used in areas that are  not often subjected to replacement or servicing. (Because it is  a three-part fastener, it should not be used where any part, in  becoming loose, could be drawn into the engine air intake.)  Other advantages of using Jo-bolts are their excellent resistance  to vibration, weight saving, and fast installation by one person.  

Presently, Jo-bolts are available in four diameters:  

•	 200 series, approximately  $\%$   inch in diameter •	 260 series, approximately  $\%$   inch in diameter •	 312 series, approximately  $\%$   inch in diameter  •	 375 series, approximately  $\%$   inch in diameter.  

Jo-bolts are available in three head styles: F (flush), P (hex  head), and FA (flush millable).  

# Lockbolts  

Lockbolts are used to attach two materials permanently. They  are lightweight and are equal in strength to standard bolts.  Lockbolts are manufactured by several companies and conform  to Military Standards, which specify the size of a lockbolt’s  head in relation to the shank diameter, plus the alloy used in  its construction. The only drawback to lockbolt installations is  that they are not easily removable compared to nuts and bolts.  

The lockbolt combines the features of a high-strength bolt and  rivet, but it has advantages over both. The lockbolt is generally  used in wing splice fittings, landing gear fittings, fuel cell  fittings, longerons, beams, skin splice plates, and other major  structural attachments. It is more easily and quickly installed  than the conventional rivets or bolts and eliminates the use  of lock washers, cotter pins, and special nuts. Like the rivet,  the lockbolt requires a pneumatic hammer or “pull gun” for  installation. When installed, it is rigidly and permanently  locked in place. Three types of lockbolts are commonly used:  the pull type, the stump type, and the blind type.  [Figure 7-20]  

# Pull Type  

Pull-type lockbolts are used mainly in aircraft primary and  secondary structures. They are installed very rapidly and have  approximately one-half the weight of equivalent AN steel  Jo-bolt is a trade name for an internally threaded three-piece  

![](images/523cf64561c7d7f1cae3b860020a61f4ef46b87a419fabc3bd48ceb1283b4fe5.jpg)  
Figure 7-19.   Aircraft bolt identification.  

bolts and nuts. A special pneumatic “pull gun” is required  to install this type of lockbolt. One person can accomplish  installation since bucking is not required.  

# Stump Type  

Stump-type lockbolts, although they do not have the extended  stem with pull grooves, are companion fasteners to pull-type  lockbolts. They are used primarily where clearance does  not permit installation of the pull-type lockbolt. A standard  pneumatic riveting hammer (with a hammer set attached  for swaging the collar into the pin locking grooves) and a  bucking bar are tools necessary for the installation of stump- type lockbolts.  

# Blind Type  

Blind-type lockbolts come as complete units or assemblies.  They have exceptional strength and sheet pull-together  characteristics. Blind lockbolts are used where only one side  of the work is accessible and, generally, where it is difficult  to drive a conventional rivet. This type of lockbolt is installed  in the same manner as the pull-type lockbolt.  

# Common Features  

Common features of the three types of lockbolts are the  annular locking grooves on the pin and the locking collar,  which is swaged into the pin’s lock grooves to lock the pin  in tension. The pins of the pull- and blind-type lockbolts are  extended for pull installation. The extension is provided with  pulling grooves and a tension breakoff groove.  

# Composition  

The pins of pull- and stump-type lockbolts are made of heat- treated alloy steel or high-strength aluminum alloy. Companion  collars are made of aluminum alloy or mild steel. The blind  lockbolt consists of a heat-treated alloy steel pin, blind sleeve  and filler sleeve, mild steel collar, and carbon steel washer.  

# Substitution  

Alloy-steel lockbolts may be used to replace steel high-shear  rivets, solid steel rivets, or AN bolts of the same diameter and  head type. Aluminum-alloy lockbolts may be used to replace  solid aluminum-alloy rivets of the same diameter and head  type. Steel and aluminum-alloy lockbolts may also be used to  replace steel and 2024T aluminum-alloy bolts, respectively,  of the same diameter. Blind lockbolts may be used to replace  solid aluminum-alloy rivets, stainless steel rivets, or all blind  rivets of the same diameter.  

# Numbering System  

The numbering systems for the various types of lockbolts are  explained by the break-outs in  Figure 7-21 .  

# Grip Range  

To determine the bolt grip range required for any application,  measure the thickness of the material with a hook scale  inserted through the hole. Once this measurement is  determined, select the correct grip range by referring to the  charts provided by the rivet manufacturer. Examples of grip  range charts are shown in  Figures 7-22  and  7-23 .  

When installed, the lockbolt collar should be swaged  substantially throughout the complete length of the collar. The  tolerance of the broken end of the pin relative to the top of the  collar must be within the dimensions given in  Figure 7-24 .  

When removal of a lockbolt becomes necessary, remove the  collar by splitting it axially with a sharp, cold chisel. Be careful  not to break out or deform the hole. The use of a backup bar  on the opposite side of the collar being split is recommended.  The pin may then be driven out with a drift punch.  

# Aircraft Nuts  

Aircraft nuts are made in a variety of shapes and sizes. They  are made of cadmium-plated carbon steel, stainless steel, or  anodized  $2024\mathrm{T}$   aluminum alloy and may be obtained with  either right- or left-hand threads. No identifying marking or  lettering appears on nuts. Only the characteristic metallic  luster or color of the aluminum, brass, or the insert can  identify them when the nut is of the self-locking type. They  can be further identified by their construction.  

Aircraft nuts can be divided into two general groups: non- self-locking and self-locking nuts. Non-self-locking nuts  are those that must be safetied by external locking devices,  such as cotter pins, safety wire, or locknuts. Self-locking nuts  contain the locking feature as an integral part.  

# Non-Self-Locking Nuts  

Most of the familiar types of nuts, including the plain nut,  the castle nut, the castellated shear nut, the plain hex nut, the  light hex nut, and the plain check nut are the non-self-locking  type.  [Figure 7-25]  

![](images/8fcaef8d233ddb61cecb0f9c9e8db447a48095b0038c3a1256b618c0917f31f1.jpg)  
Figure 7-20.   Lockbolt types.  

The castle nut, AN310, is used with drilled shank AN hex  head bolts, Clevis bolts, eyebolts, drilled head bolts, or studs.  It is rugged and can withstand large tensional loads. Slots  (called castellations) in the nut are designed to accommodate  a cotter pin or lock wire for safety.  

The castellated shear nut, AN320, is designed for use with  devices, such as drilled Clevis bolts and threaded taper pins,  which are normally subjected to shearing stress only. Like  the castle nut, it is castellated for safetying. Note, however,  that the nut is not as deep or as strong as the castle nut; also,  that the castellations are not as deep as those in the castle nut.  

The plain hex nut, AN315 and AN335 (fine and coarse  thread), is of rugged construction. This makes it suitable for  carrying large tensional loads. However, since it requires an  auxiliary locking device, such as a check nut or lock washer,  its use on aircraft structures is somewhat limited.  

The light hex nut, AN340 and AN345 (fine and coarse  thread), is a much lighter nut than the plain hex nut and must  be locked by an auxiliary device. It is used for miscellaneous  light tension requirements.  

The plain check nut, AN316, is employed as a locking device  for plain nuts, set screws, threaded rod ends, and other devices.  

The wing nut, AN350, is intended for use where the desired  tightness can be obtained by hand and where the assembly  is frequently removed.  

# Self-Locking Nuts  

As their name implies, self-locking nuts need no auxiliary  means of safetying but have a safetying feature included as  an integral part of their construction. Many types of self- locking nuts have been designed and their use has become  quite widespread. Common applications are:  

•	 Attachment of antifriction bearings and control pulleys •	 Attachment of accessories, anchor nuts around inspection holes, and small tank installation openings  •	 Attachment of rocker box covers and exhaust stacks  

Self-locking nuts are acceptable for use on certificated aircraft  subject to the restrictions of the manufacturer. Self-locking nuts  are used on aircraft to provide tight connections that do not  shake loose under severe vibration. Do not use self-locking  nuts at joints, which subject either the nut or bolt to rotation.  They may be used with antifriction bearings and control  pulleys, provided the inner race of the bearing is clamped  to the supporting structure by the nut and bolt. Plates must  be attached to the structure in a positive manner to eliminate  rotation or misalignment when tightening the bolts or screws.  

![](images/0c50db83a006e11cce4b9e5ad1a32e03b2887efdb0e81a1932b2feb044b09dd0.jpg)  

The two general types of self-locking nuts currently in use  are the all-metal type and the fiber lock type. For the sake of  simplicity, only three typical kinds of self-locking nuts are  considered in this handbook: the Boots self-locking and the  stainless steel self-locking nuts, representing the all-metal  types; and the elastic stop nut, representing the fiber insert type.  

# Boots Self-Locking Nut  

The Boots self-locking nut is of one piece, all-metal  construction designed to hold tight despite severe vibration.  Note in  Figure 7-26  that it has two sections and is essentially  two nuts in one: a locking nut and a load-carrying nut. The  two sections are connected with a spring, which is an integral  part of the nut.  

The spring keeps the locking and load-carrying sections such  a distance apart that the two sets of threads are out of phase  or spaced so that a bolt, which has been screwed through the  load-carrying section, must push the locking section outward  against the force of the spring to engage the threads of the  locking section properly.  

The spring, through the medium of the locking section, exerts  a constant locking force on the bolt in the same direction as a  force that would tighten the nut. In this nut, the load-carrying  section has the thread strength of a standard nut of comparable  

![](images/18ae1fbc6c3784ca2e1f78afc437358bbf243dd86b2153e1fff4eaaefbe8ab06.jpg)  

![Figure 7-23.   Blind-type lockbolt grip ranges. ](images/3f0c7a28f4f0429a8e123617b0f0f2d7974a67fe0b57fd9e7e0287cb6e326b1c.jpg)  

size, while the locking section presses against the threads of  the bolt and locks the nut firmly in position. Only a wrench  applied to the nut loosens it. The nut can be removed and  reused without impairing its efficiency.  

Boots self-locking nuts are made with three different spring  styles and in various shapes and sizes. The wing type that is  the most common ranges in size for No. 6 up to   $\%$   inch, the  Rol-top ranges from  $\%$   inch to  $\%$   inch, and the bellows type  ranges in size from No. 8 up to  $\%$   inch. Wing-type nuts are  made of anodized aluminum alloy, cadmium-plated carbon  

![Figure 7-24.   Pin tolerance ranges. ](images/534aa957013741d6d3f416f2e37c07160162e026ed7cc7310c19662cb4bcc3c8.jpg)  

steel, or stainless steel. The Rol-top nut is cadmium-plated  steel, and the bellows type is made of aluminum alloy only.  

# Stainless Steel Self-Locking Nut  

The stainless steel self-locking nut may be spun on and off  by hand as its locking action takes places only when the  nut is seated against a solid surface and tightened. The nut  consists of two parts: a case with a beveled locking shoulder  and key and a thread insert with a locking shoulder and  slotted keyway. Until the nut is tightened, it spins on the  bolt easily, because the threaded insert is the proper size  for the bolt. However, when the nut is seated against a solid  surface and tightened, the locking shoulder of the insert is  pulled downward and wedged against the locking shoulder  of the case. This action compresses the threaded insert and  causes it to clench the bolt tightly. The cross-sectional view  in  Figure 7-27  shows how the key of the case fits into the  slotted keyway of the insert so that when the case is turned,  the threaded insert is turned with it. Note that the slot is wider  than the key. This permits the slot to be narrowed and the  insert to be compressed when the nut is tightened.  

# Elastic Stop Nut  

The elastic stop nut is a standard nut with the height  increased to accommodate a fiber locking collar. This  fiber collar is very tough and durable and is unaffected by  immersion in hot or cold water or ordinary solvents, such  as ether, carbon tetrachloride, oils, and gasoline. It will not  

![](images/b4726d76b3471a33a690a37a16f17c7d96ecf499c74f88cc48a3c97c3671d117.jpg)  
Figure 7-25.   Non-self-locking nuts.  

damage bolt threads or plating.  

As shown in  Figure 7-28 , the fiber locking collar is not  threaded, and its inside diameter is smaller than the largest  diameter of the threaded portion or the outside diameter of  a corresponding bolt. When the nut is screwed onto a bolt, it  acts as an ordinary nut until the bolt reaches the fiber collar.  When the bolt is screwed into the fiber collar, however,  friction (or drag) causes the fiber to be pushed upward. This  creates a heavy downward pressure on the load carrying part  and automatically throws the load carrying sides of the nut  and bolt threads into positive contact. After the bolt has been  forced all the way through the fiber collar, the downward  pressure remains constant. This pressure locks and holds the  nut securely in place even under severe vibration.  

Nearly all elastic stop nuts are steel or aluminum alloy.  However, such nuts are available in practically any kind of  metal. Aluminum-alloy elastic stop nuts are supplied with an  anodized finish. Steel nuts are cadmium plated.  

Normally, elastic stop nuts can be used many times with  complete safety and without detriment to their locking  efficiency. When reusing elastic stop nuts, be sure the fiber  has not lost its locking friction or become brittle. If a nut can  be turned with the fingers, replace it.  

After the nut has been tightened, make sure the rounded or  

![](images/16e98dcf8f58da24ffde4eb16f475ff320121fe0a179c7e11236ebae9c4adf7a.jpg)  

chamfered end of the bolts, studs, or screws extends at least  the full round or chamfer through the nut. Flat end bolts,  studs, or screws should extend at least  $\%_{32}$   inch through the  nut. Bolts of  $\cdot5\%$  -inch diameter and over with cotter pin holes  may be used with self-locking nuts, but only if free from  burrs around the holes. Bolts with damaged threads and  rough ends are not acceptable. Do not tap the fiber locking  insert. The self-locking action of the elastic stop nut is the  result of having the bolt threads impress themselves into the  untapped fiber.  

Do not install elastic stop nuts in places where the temperature  is higher than  $250\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , because the effectiveness of the self- locking action is reduced beyond this point. Self-locking  nuts may be used on aircraft engines and accessories when  the engine manufacturer specifies their use.  

Self-locking nut bases are made in several forms and  materials for riveting and welding to aircraft structure  or parts.  [Figure 7-29]  Certain applications require the  installation of self-locking nuts in channels, an arrangement  that permits the attachment of many nuts with only a few  rivets. These channels are track-like bases with regularly  spaced nuts, which are either removable or non-removable.  The removable type carries a floating nut that can be snapped  in or out of the channel, thus making possible the easy  removal of damaged nuts. Nuts, such as the clinch-type and  spline-type, depend on friction for their anchorage and are  not acceptable for use in aircraft structures.  

# Sheet Spring Nuts  

Sheet spring nuts, such as speed nuts, are used with standard  and sheet metal self-tapping screws in non-structural  locations. They find various uses in supporting line clamps,  conduit clamps, electrical equipment, access doors, and the  like and are available in several types. Speed nuts are made  from spring steel and are arched prior to tightening. This  arched spring lock prevents the screw from working loose.  

![](images/1f3e4830b779cc35b2304a1b20e4d7492ddbbe2b262dd21aa935668e034f0014.jpg)  
Figure 7-26.   Self-locking nuts.  

These nuts should be used only where originally used in the  fabrication of the aircraft.  

# Internal & External Wrenching Nuts  

Two commercial types of high-strength internal or external  wrenching nuts are available; they are the internal and  external wrenching elastic stop nut and the Unbrako internal  and external wrenching nut. Both are of the self-locking  type, are heat-treated, and can carry high-strength bolt  tension loads.  

# Identification & Coding  

Part numbers designate the type of nut. The common types  and their respective part numbers are:  

•	 Plain, AN315 and AN335  •	 Castle, AN310  •	 Plain check, AN316  •	 Light hex, AN340 and AN345  • 	 Castellated shear, AN320  

The patented self-locking types are assigned part numbers  ranging from MS20363 through MS20367. The Boots, the  Flexloc, the fiber locknut, the elastic stop nut, and the self- locking nut belong to this group. Part number AN350 is  assigned to the wing nut.  

Letters and digits following the part number indicate such  

![](images/c1643b62711b5c9e8a7ef4ca57faa16396a07dc40a795840fa57df278617159f.jpg)  
Figure 7-27.   Stainless steel self-locking nut.  

items as material, size, threads per inch, and whether the  thread is right or left hand. The letter “B” following the part  number indicates the nut material to be brass, a “D” indicates  2017-T aluminum alloy, a “DD” indicates 2024-T aluminum  alloy, a “C” indicates stainless steel, and a dash in place of  a letter indicates cadmium-plated carbon steel.  

The digit (or two digits) following the dash or the material  code letter is the dash number of the nut, and it indicates the  size of the shank and threads per inch of the bolt on which  the nut fits. The dash number corresponds to the first figure  appearing in the part number coding of general purpose bolts.  A dash and the number 3, for example, indicate that the nut  fits an AN3 bolt (10-32); a dash and the number 4 means it  fits an AN4 bolt ( 1 ⁄ -28); a dash and the number 5, an AN5  4 bolt ( 5 ⁄ -24); and so on. 16  

The code numbers for self-locking nuts end in three or four  digit numbers. The last two digits refer to threads per inch,  and the one or two preceding digits stand for the nut size in  16ths of an inch.  

Some other common nuts and their code numbers are:  

# Code Number AN310D5R:  

$\mathrm{AN}310=$  aircraft castle nut  

![](images/f951873366bae623db6758039d9a810b9a0a98a2223587f0927fe9322aa499fa.jpg)

# Code Number AN320-10:  

$\mathrm{AN}320=$  aircraft castellated shear nut, cadmium-plated  carbon steel  $10\,{=}\,\%$   inch diameter, 18 threads per inch (this nut is usually  right-hand thread)  

# Code Number AN350B1032:  

$\mathrm{AN}350=$  aircraft wing nut  $\mathbf{B}=$   brass  $10=$   number 10 bolt  $32=$   threads per inch  

# Aircraft Washers  

Aircraft washers used in airframe repair are either plain, lock,  or special type washers.  

# Plain Washers  

Plain washers, both the AN960 and AN970, are used under  hex nuts.  [Figure 7-30]  They provide a smooth bearing  surface and act as a shim in obtaining correct grip length for a  bolt and nut assembly. They are used to adjust the position of  castellated nuts in respect to drilled cotter pin holes in bolts.  Use plain washers under lock washers to prevent damage to  the surface material.  

Aluminum and aluminum-alloy washers may be used under  bolt heads or nuts on aluminum alloy or magnesium structures  where corrosion caused by dissimilar metals is a factor. When  used in this manner, any electric current flow is between the  washer and the steel bolt. However, it is common practice  to use a cadmium-plated steel washer under a nut bearing  directly against a structure as this washer resists the cutting  action of a nut better than an aluminum-alloy washer.  

The AN970 steel washer provides a greater bearing area than  the AN960 washer and is used on wooden structures under both  the head and the nut of a bolt to prevent crushing the surface.  

# Lock Washers  

Lock washers, both the AN935 and AN936, are used with  machine screws or bolts where the self-locking or castellated- type nut is not appropriate. The spring action of the washer  (AN935) provides enough friction to prevent loosening of  the nut from vibration.  [Figure 7-30]  

Lock washers should never be used under the following  conditions:  

![](images/d1798ac6d73fb7fd0fce3e5b4e783162eeed36deb27e4f8ebce395546cd62ae5.jpg)  
Figure 7-29.   Self-locking nut bases.  

•	 With fasteners to primary or secondary structures •	 With fasteners on any part of the aircraft where failure  might result in damage or danger to the aircraft or  personnel •	 Where failure would permit the opening of a joint to  the airflow •	 Where the screw is subject to frequent removal •	 Where the washers are exposed to the airflow •	 Where the washers are subject to corrosive conditions •	 Where the washer is against soft material without a  plain washer underneath to prevent gouging the surface  

Shake-Proof Lock Washers  

Shake-proof lock washers are round washers designed with  tabs or lips that are bent upward across the sides of a hex nut  or bolt to lock the nut in place. There are various methods  of securing the lock washer to prevent it from turning, such  as an external tab bent downward   $90^{\circ}$   into a small hole in  the face of the unit or an internal tab that fits a keyed bolt.  

Shake-proof lock washers can withstand higher heat than  other methods of safetying and can be used under high  vibration conditions safely. They should be used only once,  because the tabs tend to break when bent a second time.  

# Special Washers  

The ball socket and seat washers, AC950 and AC955, are  special washers used where a bolt is installed at an angle to a  surface or where perfect alignment with a surface is required.  These washers are used together.  [Figure 7-30]  

The NAS143 and MS20002 washers are used for internal  wrenching bolts of the NAS144 through NAS158 series.  This washer is either plain or countersunk. The countersunk  washer (designated as NAS143C and MS20002C) is used  to seat the bolt head shank radius, and the plain washer is  used under the nut.  

# Installation of Nuts, Washers, & Bolts Bolt & Hole Sizes  

Slight clearances in bolt holes are permissible wherever bolts  are used in tension and are not subject to reversal of load. A  few of the applications in which clearance of holes may be  permitted are in pulley brackets, conduit boxes, lining trim,  and miscellaneous supports and brackets.  

Bolt holes are to be normal to the surface involved to provide  full bearing surface for the bolt head and nut and must not be  oversized or elongated. A bolt in such a hole carries none of  its shear load until parts have yielded or deformed enough  to allow the bearing surface of the oversized hole to contact  the bolt. In this respect, remember that bolts do not become  swaged to fill up the holes, as do rivets.  

In cases of oversized or elongated holes in critical members,  obtain advice from the aircraft or engine manufacturer before  drilling or reaming the hole to take the next larger bolt.  Usually such factors as edge distance, clearance, or load  factor must be considered. Oversized or elongated holes in  noncritical members can usually be drilled or reamed to the  next larger size.  

Many bolt holes, particularly those in primary connecting  elements, have close tolerances. Generally, it is permissible  to use the first lettered drill size larger than the normal bolt  diameter, except where the AN hexagon bolts are used in  light-drive fit (reamed) applications and where NAS close  tolerance bolts or AN Clevis bolts are used.  

Light-drive fits for bolts (specified on the repair drawings as  0.0015 inch maximum clearance between bolt and hole) are  required in places where bolts are used in repair, or where  they are placed in the original structure.  

The fit of holes and bolts cannot be defined in terms of shaft  and hole diameters; it is defined in terms of the friction between  bolt and hole when sliding the bolt into place. A tight drive fit,  for example, is one in which a sharp blow of a 12- or 14-ounce  hammer is required to move the bolt. A bolt that requires a hard  blow and sounds tight is considered too tight a fit. A light-drive  fit is one in which a bolt moves when a hammer handle is held  against its head and pressed by the weight of the body.  

# Installation Practices  

Examine the markings on the bolt head to determine that  each bolt is of the correct material. It is extremely important  to use like bolts in replacement. In every case, refer to the  applicable Maintenance Instructions Manual and Illustrated  Parts Breakdown.  

Be sure that washers are used under both the heads of bolts  and nuts unless their omission is specified. A washer guards  against mechanical damage to the material being bolted and  prevents corrosion of the structural members. An aluminum- alloy washer should be used under the head and nut of a steel  bolt securing aluminum alloy or magnesium alloy members.  Any corrosion that occurs attacks the washer rather than the  members. Steel washers should be used when joining steel  members with steel bolts.  

Whenever possible, place the bolt with the head on top or in  the forward position. This positioning tends to prevent the  bolt from slipping out if the nut is accidentally lost.  

Be certain that the bolt grip length is correct. Grip length is  the length of the unthreaded portion of the bolt shank. The  grip length should equal the thickness of the material being  bolted together. However, bolts of slightly greater grip length  may be used if washers are placed under the nut or the bolt  head. In the case of plate nuts, add shims under the plate.  

# Safetying of Bolts & Nuts  

It is very important that all bolts or nuts, except the self- locking type, be safetied after installation. This prevents  them from loosening in flight due to vibration. Methods of  safetying are discussed later in this chapter.  

# Repair of Damaged Internal Threads  

Installation or replacement of bolts is simple when compared  to the installation or replacement of studs. Bolt heads and nuts  are cut in the open, whereas studs are installed into internal  threads in a casting or built-up assembly. Damaged threads  on bolts or nuts can be seen and only require replacement  of the defective part. If internal threads are damaged, two  alternatives are apparent: the part may be replaced or the  threads repaired or replaced. Correction of the thread problem  is usually cheaper and more convenient. Two methods of  repairing are by replacement bushings or helicoils.  

# Replacement Bushings  

Bushings are usually special material (steel or brass spark  plug bushings into aluminum cylinder heads). A material  that resists wear is used where removal and replacement is  frequent. The external threads on the bushing are usually  coarse. The bushing is installed, a thread lock compound  may or may not be used, and staked to prevent loosening.  Many bushings have left-hand threads external and right- hand threads internal. With this installation, removal of the  

![](images/ec0480518bb4945b47d83baa6d45c7211e4f4322286fe0fe6972ccecc5887d6c.jpg)  
Figure 7-30.   Various types of washers.  

Bushings for common installations, such as spark plugs, may  be up to 0.040 oversize (in increments of 0.005). Original  installation and overhaul shop replacements are shrunk fit:  a heated cylinder head and a frozen bushing.  

Helicoils  

Helicoils are precision-formed screw thread coils of 18-8  stainless steel wire having a diamond-shaped cross section.  [Figure 7-31]  They form unified coarse or unified fine thread  classes 2-band 3B when assembled into (helicoil) threaded  holes. The assembled insert accommodates UNJ (controlled  radius root) male threaded members. Each insert has a driving  tang with a notch to facilitate removal of the tang after the  insert is screwed into a helicoil tapped hole.  

They are used as screw thread bushings. In addition to being  used to restore damaged threads, they are used in the original  design of missiles, aircraft engines, and all types of mechanical  equipment and accessories to protect and strengthen tapped  threads in light materials, metals, and plastics, particularly in  locations that require frequent assembly and disassembly and/ or where a screw locking action is desired.  

Helicoil installation is a 5 or 6 step operation, depending  upon how the last step is classed.  [Figure 7-32]  

Step 1:	 Determine what threads are damaged. Step 2:	 (a)	 New installation of helicoil—drill out  damaged threads to minimum depth  specified. (b)	 Previously installed helicoil—using proper  size extracting tool, place edge of blade in   $90^{\circ}$   from the edge of the insert. Tap with  hammer to seat tool. Turn to left, applying  pressure, until insert backs out. Threads are  not damaged if insert is properly removed. Step 3:	 Tap—use the tap of required nominal thread size.  The tapping procedure is the same as standard  thread tapping. Tap length must be equal to or  exceed the requirement. Step 4: 	 Gauge—threads may be checked with a helicoil  thread gauge. Step 5: 	 Insert assembly—using proper tool, install insert  to a depth that puts end of top coil  $\%$   to  $\%$   turn  below the top surface of the tapped hole. Step 6:	 Tang breakoff—select proper breakoff tool.  Tangs should be removed from all drilled  through holes. In blind holes, the tangs may be  removed when necessary if enough hole-depth  is provided below the tang of the installed insert.  

These are not to be considered specific instructions on helicoil  installation. The manufacturer’s instruction must be followed  when making an installation.  

Helicoils are available for the following threads: unified  coarse, unified fine, metric, spark plug, and national taper  pipe threads.  

# Fastener Torque  

# Torque  

As the speed of an aircraft increases, each structural member  becomes more highly stressed. It is therefore extremely  important that each member carry no more and no less than  the load for which it was designed. To distribute the loads  safely throughout a structure, it is necessary that proper  torque be applied to all nuts, bolts, studs, and screws.  Using the proper torque allows the structure to develop  its designed strength and greatly reduces the possibility of  failure due to fatigue.  

# Torque Wrenches  

The three most commonly used torque wrenches are  the flexible beam, rigid frame, and the ratchet types.  [Figure 7-33]  When using the flexible beam and the rigid  frame torque wrenches, the torque value is read visually on  a dial or scale mounted on the handle of the wrench.  

To use the ratchet type, unlock the grip and adjust the handle  to the desired setting on the micrometer-type scale, then  relock the grip. Install the required socket or adapter to the  square drive of the handle. Place the wrench assembly on the  nut or bolt, and pull the wrench assembly on the nut or bolt  in a clockwise direction with a smooth, steady motion. (A  fast or jerky motion results in an improperly torqued unit.)  When the applied torque reaches the torque value indicated  on the handle setting, the handle automatically releases or  “breaks” and moves freely for a short distance. The release  and free travel is easily felt, so there is no doubt about when  the torqueing process is completed.  

To assure getting the correct amount of torque on the  fasteners, all torque wrenches must be tested at least once a  month or more often if necessary.  

Note:  It is not advisable to use a handle length extension on  a flexible beam-type torque wrench at any time. A handle  extension alone has no effect on the reading of the other types.  The use of a drive end extension on any type of torque wrench  makes the use of the formula mandatory. When applying the  formula, force must be applied to the handle of the torque  wrench at the point from which the measurements were taken.  If this is not done, the torque obtained is incorrect.  

# Torque Tables  

Use the standard torque table as a guide in tightening nuts,  studs, bolts, and screws whenever specific torque values are  not called out in maintenance procedures. The following  rules apply for correct use of the torque table:  [Figure 7-34]  

1. 	 To obtain values in foot-pounds, divide inch-pounds  by 12. 2. 	 Do not lubricate nuts or bolts except for corrosion-  resistant steel parts or where specifically instructed  to do so. 3.	 Always tighten by rotating the nut first if possible.  When space considerations make it necessary to  tighten by rotating the bolt head, approach the high  side of the indicated torque range. Do not exceed the  maximum allowable torque value. 4.	 Maximum torque ranges should be used only when  materials and surfaces being joined are of sufficient  thickness, area, and strength to resist breaking,  warping, or other damage. 5.	 For corrosion-resisting steel nuts, use torque values  given for shear-type nuts. 6.	 The use of any type of drive end extension on a torque  wrench changes the dial reading required to obtain  the actual values indicated in the standard torque  range tables. When using a drive end extension, the  torque wrench reading must be computed by use of  the proper formula, which is included in the handbook  accompanying the torque wrench.  

# Cotter Pin Hole Line Up  

![](images/19bbe3df5906d71e559395d09af7c35496ef1f79aa41537d3b1b380da62edba8.jpg)  
Figure 7-31.   Helicoil insert.  

holes may not line up with the slots in the nuts for the range  of recommended values. Except in cases of highly-stressed  engine parts, the nut may not be over torque. Remove  hardware and realign the holes. The torque loads specified  may be used for all unlubricated cadmium-plated steel nuts  of the fine or coarse thread series, which have approximately  equal number of threads and equal face bearing areas. These  values do not apply where special torque requirements are  specified in the maintenance manual.  

If the head end, rather than the nut, must be turned in the  tightening operation, maximum torque values may be  increased by an amount equal to shank friction, provided the  latter is first measured by a torque wrench.  

When tightening castellated nuts on bolts, the cotter pin  

![](images/7702a94d702ad04ec7d19b47763bec5587a0c856e3a347435de2bba16178d28c.jpg)  

# Aircraft Rivets  

Sheets of metal must be fastened together to form the aircraft  structure, and this is usually done with solid aluminum-alloy  rivets. A rivet is a metal pin with a formed head on one  end when the rivet is manufactured. The shank of the rivet  is inserted into a drilled hole, and its shank is then upset  (deformed) by a hand or pneumatic tool. The second head,  formed either by hand or by pneumatic equipment, is called  a “shop head.” The shop head functions in the same manner  as a nut on a bolt. In addition to their use for joining aircraft  skin sections, rivets are also used for joining spar sections, for  holding rib sections in place, for securing fittings to various  parts of the aircraft, and for fastening innumerable bracing  members and other parts together. The rivet creates a bond  that is at least as strong as the material being joined.  

Two of the major types of rivets used in aircraft are the  common solid shank type, which must be driven using a  bucking bar, and the special (blind) rivets, which may be  installed where it is impossible to use a bucking bar.  

Aircraft rivets are not hardware store rivets. Rivets purchased  at a hardware store should never be used as a substitute for  aircraft quality rivets. The rivets may be made from very  different materials, the strength of the rivets differs greatly,  and their shear strength qualities are very different. The  countersunk heads on hardware store rivets are  $78^{\circ}$  , whereas  countersunk aircraft rivets have   $100^{\circ}$   angle heads for more  surface contact to hold it in place.  

# Standards and Specifications  

The FAA requires that the structural strength and  integrity of type-certificated aircraft conform to all  airworthiness requirements. These requirements apply to  performance, structural strength, and integrity as well as  flight characteristics. To meet these requirements, each  aircraft must meet the same standards. To accomplish  standardization, all materials and hardware must be  manufactured to a standard of quality. Specifications and  standards for aircraft hardware are usually identified by the  organization that originated them. Some of the common  standardizing organizations include:  

AMS	 Aeronautical Material Specifications  AN	 Air Force-Navy AND	 Air Force-Navy Design  AS	 Aeronautical Standard ASA	 American Standards Association  ASTM	 American Society for Testing Materials  MS	 Military Standard NAF	 Naval Aircraft Factory

SAE	 Society of Automotive Engineers  

When a MS20426-AD4-6 rivet is required, the specifications  have already been written for it in the Military Standard (MS)  specifications. That information is available to the aircraft  manufacturers, the rivet manufacturers and the mechanic.  The specifications designate the material to be used as well  as the head type, diameter, and length of the rivet. The use  of standardized materials in the production of aircraft makes  each aircraft exactly the same as the previous one and makes  them less expensive to build.  

Aircraft rivets are manufactured to much higher standards and  specifications than rivets manufactured for general use. When  aircraft manufacturers started building all-metal aircraft in  the 1930s, different manufacturers had different rivet head  designs. Brazier heads, modified brazier heads, button heads,  mushroom heads, flatheads, and   $78^{\circ}$   countersunk heads  were used. As aircraft standardized, four rivet head designs  almost completely replaced all the others. Rivets exposed  to the airflow over the top of the structure are usually either  universal head MS20470 or   $100^{\circ}$   countersunk head MS20426  rivets. For rivets used in internal structures, the roundhead  MS20430 and the flathead MS20442 are generally used.  

# Solid Shank Rivets  

Solid shank rivets are generally used in repair work. They  are identified by the kind of material of which they are made,  their head type, size of shank, and their temper condition.  The designation of the solid shank rivet head type, such as  universal head, roundhead, flathead, countersunk head, and  brazier head, depends on the cross-sectional shape of the  head.  [Figure 7-35]  The temper designation and strength  are indicated by special markings on the head of the rivet.  

The material used for most aircraft solid shank rivets is  aluminum alloy. The strength and temper conditions of  aluminum-alloy rivets are identified by digits and letters  similar to those adopted for the identification of strength and  temper conditions of aluminum and aluminum-alloy stock.  The 1100, 2017-T, 2024-T, 2117-T, and 5056 rivets are the  five grades usually available.  

The 1100 rivet, which is composed of 99.45 percent pure  aluminum, is very soft. It is for riveting the softer aluminum  alloys, such as 1100, 3003, and 5052, which are used for  nonstructural parts (all parts where strength is not a factor).  The riveting of map cases is a good example of where a rivet  of 1100 aluminum alloy may be used.  

The 2117-T rivet, known as the field rivet, is used more  than any other for riveting aluminum alloy structures. The  field rivet is in wide demand, because it is ready for use as  received and needs no further heat-treating or annealing. It  also has a high resistance to corrosion.  

The 2017-T and 2024-T rivets are used in aluminum-alloy  structures where more strength is needed than is obtainable  with the same size 2217-T rivet. These rivets are known as  “ice box rivets,” are annealed and must be kept refrigerated  until they are to be driven. The 2017-T rivet should be driven  within approximately 1 hour and the 2024-T rivet within 10  to 20 minutes after removal from refrigeration.  

The 5056 rivet is used for riveting magnesium-alloy  structures because of its corrosion-resistant qualities in  combination with magnesium.  

Mild steel rivets are used for riveting steel parts. The corrosion- resistant steel rivets are for riveting corrosion-resistant steels  in firewalls, exhaust stack brackets, and similar structures.  

Monel rivets are used for riveting nickel-steel alloys. They  can be substituted for those made of corrosion-resistant steel  in some cases.  

The use of copper rivets in aircraft repair is limited. Copper  rivets can be used only on copper alloys or nonmetallic  materials, such as leather.  

Metal temper is an important factor in the riveting process,  especially with aluminum alloy rivets. Aluminum-alloy rivets  have the same heat-treating characteristics as aluminum-alloy  stock. They can be hardened and annealed in the same manner  as aluminum. The rivet must be soft, or comparatively soft,  before a good head can be formed. The 2017-T and 2024-T  rivets are annealed before being driven. They harden with age.  

The process of heat-treating (annealing) rivets is much the  same as that for stock. Either an electric air furnace, a salt bath,  or a hot oil bath is needed. The heat-treating range, depending  on the alloy, is  $625\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $950\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   For convenient handling, rivets  are heated in a tray or a wire basket. They are quenched in cold  water   $(70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   immediately after heat-treating.  

The 2017-T and 2024-T rivets, which are heat-treatable  rivets, begin to age harden within a few minutes after being  exposed to room temperature. Therefore, they must be used  immediately after quenching or else be placed in cold storage.  

The most commonly used means for holding heat-treatable  rivets at low temperature (below  $32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  ) is to keep them in a  refrigerator. They are referred to as “icebox” rivets. Under  this storage condition, they remain soft enough for driving  for up to 2 weeks. Any rivets not used within that time should  be removed for reheat-treating.  

![](images/5db9b610c40cb83083615bed563f7a74e666386affabf8fa52628b9949415103.jpg)  
Figure 7-34.   Standard torque table (inch-pounds).  

Icebox rivets attain about one-half their maximum strength  in approximately 1 hour after driving and full strength in  about 4 days. When 2017-T rivets are exposed to room  temperature for 1 hour or longer, they must be subject to  reheat-treatment. This also applies to 2024-T rivets exposed  to room temperature for a period exceeding 10 minutes.  

Once an icebox rivet has been taken from the refrigerator, it  should not be mixed with the rivets still in cold storage. If  more rivets are removed from the refrigerator than can be used  in 15 minutes, they should be placed in a separate container  and stored for reheat-treatment. Heat-treatment of rivets  may be repeated a number of times if done properly. Proper  heating times and temperatures are shown in  Figure 7-36 .  

Most metals, and therefore aircraft rivet stock, are subject  to corrosion. Corrosion may be the result of local climatic  conditions or the fabrication process used. It is reduced  to a minimum by using metals that are highly resistant to  corrosion and possess the correct strength-to-weight ratio.  

Ferrous metals placed in contact with moist salt air rust if not  properly protected. Nonferrous metals, those without an iron  base, do not rust, but a similar process known as corrosion  takes place. The salt in moist air (found in the coastal areas)  attacks the aluminum alloys. It is a common experience to  inspect the rivets of an aircraft, which has been operated near  salt water, and find them badly corroded.  

If a copper rivet is inserted into an aluminum-alloy structure,  two dissimilar metals are brought in contact with each other.  Remember, all metals possess a small electrical potential.  Dissimilar metals in contact with each other in the presence of  moisture cause an electrical current to flow between them and  chemical byproducts to be formed. Principally, this results  in the deterioration of one of the metals.  

Certain aluminum alloys react to each other and, therefore,  must be thought of as dissimilar metals. The commonly used  aluminum alloys may be divided into the two groups shown  in  Figure 7-37 .  

Members within either group A or group B can be considered  as similar to each other and will not react to others within the  same group. A corroding action will take place, however, if  any metal of group A comes in contact with a metal in group  B in the presence of moisture.  

Avoid the use of dissimilar metals whenever possible. Their  incompatibility is a factor that was considered when the AN  Standards were adopted. To comply with AN Standards,  the manufacturers must put a protective surface coating on  the rivets. This may be zinc chromate, metal spray, or an  anodized finish.  

The protective coating on a rivet is identified by its color. A  rivet coated with zinc chromate is yellow, an anodized surface  is pearl gray, and the metal sprayed rivet is identified by a  silvery gray color. If a situation arises in which a protective  coating must be applied on the job, paint the rivet with zinc  chromate before it is used and again after it is driven.  

# Identification  

Markings on the heads of rivets are used to classify their  characteristics. These markings may be either a raised teat,  two raised teats, a dimple, a pair of raised dashes, a raised  cross, a single triangle, or a raised dash; some other heads  have no markings.  

The different markings indicate the composition of the rivet  stock. As explained previously, the rivets have different colors  to identify the manufacturers’ protective surface coating.  

Roundhead rivets are used in the interior of the aircraft,  except where clearance is required for adjacent members.  The roundhead rivet has a deep, rounded top surface. The  head is large enough to strengthen the sheet around the hole  and, at the same time, resists tension.  

The flathead rivet, like the roundhead rivet, is used on interior  structures. It is used where maximum strength is needed and  where there is not sufficient clearance to use a roundhead  rivet. It is seldom, if ever, used on external surfaces. The  brazier head rivet has a head of large diameter, which makes it  particularly adaptable for riveting thin sheet stock (skin). The  brazier head rivet offers only slight resistance to the airflow,  and because of this factor, it is frequently used for riveting skin  on exterior surfaces, especially on aft sections of the fuselage  and empennage. It is used for riveting thin sheets exposed to the  slipstream. A modified brazier head rivet is also manufactured;  it is simply a brazier head of reduced diameter.  

The universal head rivet is a combination of the roundhead,  flathead, and brazier head. It is used in aircraft construction  and repair in both interior and exterior locations. When  replacement is necessary for protruding head rivets— roundhead, flathead, or brazier head—they can be replaced  by universal head rivets.  

The countersunk head rivet is flat topped and beveled toward  the shank so that it fits into a countersunk or dimpled hole  and is flush with the material’s surface. The angle at which  the head slopes may vary from   $78^{\circ}$   to   $120^{\circ}$  . The   $100^{\circ}$   rivet  is the most commonly used type. These rivets are used to  fasten sheets over which other sheets must fit. They are also

Rivet identification chart.   Figure 7-35.  

used on exterior surfaces of the aircraft, because they offer  only slight resistance to the slipstream and help to minimize  turbulent airflow.  

The markings on the heads of rivets indicate the material  of which they are made and, therefore, their strength.  Figure 7-37  identifies the rivet head markings and the  materials indicated by them. Although there are three  materials indicated by a plain head, it is possible to  distinguish their difference by color. The 1100 is an  aluminum color; the mild steel is a typical steel color; and  the copper rivet is a copper color. Any head marking can  appear on any head style of the same material.  

A part number identifies each type of rivet so that the user  can select the correct rivet for the job. The type of rivet head  is identified by AN or MS standard numbers. The numbers  selected are in series and each series represents a particular  type of head.  

The most common numbers and the types of heads they  represent are:  

AN426 or MS20426—countersunk head rivets   $(100^{\circ})$  AN430 or MS20430—roundhead rivets  AN441—flathead rivets  AN456—brazier head rivets AN470 or MS20470—universal head rivets  

There are also letters and numbers added to a part number.  The letters designate alloy content; the numbers designate  rivet diameter and length. The letters in common uses for  alloy designation are:  

A—Aluminum alloy, 1100 or 3003 composition  AD—Aluminum alloy, 2117-T composition  

![](images/52b524da8a4ebcb6ac7ef717a68fdb15c878bac463292819c157ef05b68a7473.jpg)  

D—Aluminum alloy, 2017-T composition  DD—Aluminum alloy, 2024-T composition  B—Aluminum alloy, 5056 composition C—Copper  M—Monel  

The absence of a letter following the AN standard number  indicates a rivet manufactured from mild steel.  

The first number following the material composition letters  expresses the diameter of the rivet shank in 32nds of an inch.  For example, 3 indicates   $\%_{2}$  , 5 indicates   $\%_{32}$  , and so forth.  [Figure 7-38]  

The last number(s), separated by a dash from the preceding  number, expresses the length of the rivet shank in 16ths of an  inch. For example, 3 indicates  $\%$  , 7 indicates  7 ⁄ , 11 indicates  6 16  ${}^{11}\!/\!_{16.}$  , and so forth.  [Figure 7-38]  

An example of identification marking of a rivet is:  

AN470AD3-5—complete part number  AN—Air Force-Navy standard number  470—universal head rivet AD—2117-T aluminum alloy   $3{-}\%_{32}$   in diameter 5— 5 ⁄  in length 16  

# Blind Rivets  

There are many places on an aircraft where access to both  sides of a riveted structure or structural part is impossible, or  where limited space does not permit the use of a bucking bar.  Also, in the attachment of many non-structural parts, such as  aircraft interior furnishings, flooring, deicing boots, and the  like, the full strength of solid shank rivets is not necessary.  

For use in such places, special rivets have been designed that  can be bucked from the front. Special rivets are sometimes  lighter than solid shank rivets, yet amply strong for intended  use. These rivets are produced by several manufacturers and  

![Figure 7-37.   Aluminum groupings. ](images/fd7f39fab2ec65e33f9058d9adde82c2fb0a116cfa4ed11d880986476736aaf3.jpg)  

have unique characteristics that require special installation  tools, special installation procedures, and special removal  procedures. That is why they are called special rivets.  Because these rivets are often inserted in locations where  one head (usually the shop head) cannot be seen, they are  also called blind rivets.  

# Mechanically-Expanded Rivets  

Two classes of mechanically-expanded rivets are discussed here:  

•	 Non-structural—self-plugging (friction lock) rivets, pull-thru rivets •	 Mechanical lock—flush fracturing, self-plugging rivets  

# Self-Plugging Rivets (Friction Lock)  

The self-plugging (friction lock) blind rivets are manufactured  by several companies. The same general basic information  about their fabrication, composition, uses, selection,  installation, inspection, and removal procedures apply to  all of them.  

Self-plugging (friction lock) rivets are fabricated in two parts:  a rivet head with a hollow shank or sleeve, and a stem that  extends through the hollow shank.  Figure 7-39  illustrates a  protruding head and a countersunk head self-plugging rivet  produced by one manufacturer.  

Several events, in their proper sequence, occur when a pulling  force is applied to the stem of the rivet:  

1.	 The stem is pulled into the rivet shank.  2.	 The mandrel portion of the stem forces the rivet shank  to expand. 3.	 When friction (or pulling action pressure) becomes  great enough, it causes the stem to snap at a breakoff  groove on the stem.  

The plug portion (bottom end of the stem) is retained in the  shank of the rivet giving the rivet much greater shear strength  than could be obtained from a hollow rivet.  

Self-plugging (friction lock) rivets are fabricated in two  common head styles: a protruding head like the MS20470  or universal head, and a   $100^{\circ}$   countersunk head. Other head  styles are available from some manufacturers.  

The stem of the self-plugging (friction lock) rivet may have a  knot or knob on the upper portion, or it may have a serrated  portion.  [Figure 7-39]  

Self-plugging (friction lock) rivets are fabricated from several  materials. Rivets are available in the following material  combinations: stem 2017 aluminum alloy and sleeve 2117  aluminum alloy; stem 2017 aluminum alloy and sleeve 5056  aluminum alloy; and stem steel and sleeve steel.  

Self-plugging (friction lock) rivets are designed so that  installation requires only one person; it is not necessary  to have the work accessible from both sides. The pulling  strength of the rivet stem is such that a uniform job can always  be assured. Because it is not necessary to have access to the  opposite side of the work, self- plugging (friction lock) rivets  can be used to attach assemblies to hollow tubes, corrugated  sheet, hollow boxes, and so forth. Because a hammering force  is not necessary to install the rivet, it can be used to attach  assemblies to plywood or plastics.  

Factors to consider in the selection of the correct rivet for  installation are: installation location, composition of the  material being riveted, thickness of the material being riveted,  and strength desired.  

If the rivet is to be installed on an aerodynamically  smooth surface, or if clearance for an assembly is needed,  countersunk head rivets should be selected. In other areas  where clearance or smoothness is not a factor, the protruding  head type rivet may be utilized.  

Material composition of the rivet shank depends upon the  type of material being riveted. Aluminum alloy 2117 shank  rivets can be used on most aluminum alloys. Aluminum alloy  5056 shank rivets should be used when the material being  riveted is magnesium. Steel rivets should always be selected  for riveting assemblies fabricated from steel.  

The thickness of the material being riveted determines the  overall length of the shank of the rivet. As a general rule,  the shank of the rivet should extend beyond the material  thickness approximately  $\%_{4}$   inch to   $\%$   inch before the stem  is pulled.  [Figure 7-40]  

# Pull-Thru Rivets  

Several companies manufacture the pull-thru blind rivets.  The same general basic information about their fabrication,  composition, uses, selection, installation, inspection, and  removal procedures apply to all of them.  

Pull-thru rivets are fabricated in two parts: a rivet head with  a hollow shank or sleeve and a stem that extends through the  hollow shank.  Figure 7-41  illustrates a protruding head and  a countersunk head pull-thru rivet.  

Several events, in their proper sequence, occur when a pulling  force is applied to the stem of the rivet:  

1.	 The stem is pulled through the rivet shank.  

![](images/e7917f136373ad8b4f0ccc6665124fea3a988db9f991a02f8765e08df791eac2.jpg)  
Figure 7-38.   Methods of measuring rivets.  

2.	 The mandrel portion of the stem forces the shank to  expand forming the blind head and filling the hole.  

Pull-thru rivets are fabricated in two common head styles:  protruding head like the MS20470 or universal head and a   $100^{\circ}$   countersunk head. Other head styles are available from  some manufacturers.  

Pull-thru rivets are fabricated from several materials. The  most commonly used are 2117-T4 aluminum alloy, 5056  aluminum alloy, Monel. Pull-thru rivets are designed so that  installation requires only one person; it is not necessary to  have the work accessible from both sides.  

Factors to consider in the selection of the correct rivet for  installation are: installation location, composition of the  material being riveted, thickness of the material being riveted,  and strength desired.  

The thickness of the material being riveted determines the  overall length of the shank of the rivet. As a general rule,  the shank of the rivet should extend beyond the material  thickness approximately  $\%_{4}$   inch to  $\%$   inch before the stem  is pulled.  [Figure 7-42]  

Each company that manufactures pull-thru rivets has a code  number to help users obtain correct rivet for the grip range of  a particular installation. In addition, MS numbers are used for  identification purposes. Numbers are similar to those shown  on the preceding pages.  

# Self-Plugging Rivets (Mechanical Lock)  

Self-plugging (mechanical lock) rivets are like self-plugging  (friction lock) rivets, except for the way the stem is retained in  the rivet sleeve. This type of rivet has a positive mechanical  locking collar to resist vibrations that cause the friction lock  rivets to loosen and possibly fall out.  [Figure 7-43]  Also,  the mechanical locking-type rivet stem breaks off flush with  the head and usually does not require further stem trimming  when properly installed. Self-plugging (mechanical lock)  rivets display all the strength characteristics of solid shank  rivets and, in most cases, can be substituted rivet for rivet.  

# Bulbed CherryLOCK ®  Rivets  

The large blind head of this fastener introduced the word  “bulb” to blind rivet terminology. In conjunction with the  unique residual preload developed by the high stem break  load, its proven fatigue strength makes it the only blind rivet  interchangeable structurally with solid rivets.  [Figure 7-44]  

# Wiredraw CherryLOCK ®  Rivets  

There is a wide range of sizes, materials, and strength levels  from which to select. This fastener is especially suited for  sealing applications and joints requiring an excessive amount  of sheet take-up.  [Figure 7-45]  

# Huck ®  Mechanical Locked Rivets  

Self-plugging (mechanical lock) rivets are fabricated in two  sections: a head and shank (including a conical recess and  locking collar in the head) and a serrated stem that extends  through the shank. Unlike the friction lock rivet, the Huck ®  mechanical lock rivet has a locking collar that forms a positive  lock for retention of the stem in the shank of the rivet. This  collar is seated in position during the installation of the rivet.  

# Material  

Self-plugging (mechanical lock) rivets are fabricated with  

![](images/278954aa9d30ab36400231c198589211b40c26383f793717835d1d4776b94816.jpg)  
Figure 7-39.   Self-plugging (friction lock) rivets.  

sleeves (rivet shanks) of 2017 and 5056 aluminum alloys,  Monel, or stainless steel.  

The mechanical lock type of self-plugging rivet can be  used in the same applications as the friction lock type of  rivet. In addition, because of its greater stem retention  characteristic, installation in areas subject to considerable  vibration is recommended.  

The same general requirements must be met in the  selection of the mechanical lock rivet as for the friction  lock rivet. Composition of the material being joined  together determines the composition of the rivet sleeve.  For example, 2017 aluminum alloy rivets for most aluminum  alloys and 5056 aluminum rivets for magnesium.  

Figure 7-46  depicts the sequences of a typical mechanically- locked blind rivet. The form and function may vary slightly  between blind rivet styles and specifics should be obtained  from manufacturers.  

# Head Styles  

Self-plugging mechanical locked blind rivets are available  in several head styles depending on the installation  requirements.  [Figure 7-47]  

# Diameters  

Shank diameters are measured in  $\%_{32}$  -inch increments and are  generally identified by the first dash number: -3 indicates  $\%_{2}$  inch diameter, -4 indicates  $\%$   diameter, and so forth. Both  nominal and   $\%4\%$  -inch oversize diameters are available.  

# Grip Length  

Grip length refers to the maximum total sheet thickness  to be riveted and is measured in   $\%$   of an inch. This is  generally identified by the second dash number. Unless  otherwise noted, most blind rivets have their grip lengths  (maximum grip) marked on the rivet head and have a total  grip range of  1 ⁄  inch. For example,  $-04$   grip rivet has a grip  16 range of  $\sqrt[3]{\phantom{\frac{1}{6}}"}$   to  $\%"$  .  [Figure 7-48]  

To determine the proper grip rivet to use, measure the material  thickness with a grip selection gauge (available from blind  rivet manufacturers). The proper use of a grip selector  gauge is shown in  Figure 7-49 .  

The thickness of the material being riveted determines the  overall length of the shank of the rivet. As a general rule,  the shank of the rivet should extend beyond the material  thickness approximately  $\%_{4}$   inch to  $\%$   inch before the stem  is pulled.  [Figure 7-50]

# Rivet Identification  

Each company that manufactures self-plugging (friction  lock) rivets has a code number to help users obtain the  correct rivet for the grip range or material thickness of a  particular installation. In addition, MS numbers are used for  identification purposes.  Figures 7-51  through  7-54  contain  examples of part numbers for self-plugging (friction lock)  rivets that are representative of each.

# Special Shear and Bearing Load Fasteners  

Many special fasteners produce high strength with  lightweight and can be used in place of conventional AN  bolts and nuts. When AN bolts are tightened with the nut, the  bolt stretches, narrowing the diameter and then the bolt is no  longer tight in the hole. Special fasteners eliminate this loose  fit, because they are held in place by a collar that is squeezed  into position. These fasteners are not under the same tensile  loads as a bolt during installation. Special fasteners are also  used extensively for light sport aircraft (LSA). Always follow  the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations.  

# Pin Rivets  

Pin (Hi-Shear) rivets are classified as special rivets but are  not of the blind type. Access to both sides of the material  is required to install this type of rivet. Pin rivets have the  same shear strength as bolts of equal diameters, are about 40  percent of the weight of a bolt, and require only about one- fifth as much time for installation as a bolt, nut, and washer  combination. They are approximately three times as strong  as solid shank rivets.  

Pin rivets are essentially threadless bolts. The pin is headed at  one end and is grooved about the circumference at the other. A  metal collar is swaged onto the grooved end effecting a firm,  tight fit.  [Figure 7-55]  Pin rivets are fabricated in a variety  of materials but should be used only in shear applications.  They should never be used where the grip length is less than  

![](images/78f24c0d5fd330d5a454b3d0d226e41877fe236a02fb56a2b7076ada875d60e2.jpg)

the shank diameter.  

Part numbers for pin rivets can be interpreted to give the  diameter and grip length of the individual rivets. A typical  part number breakdown would be:

# Taper-Lok  

Taper-Loks are the strongest special fasteners used in aircraft  construction. The Taper-Lok exerts a force on the walls of the  hole because of its tapered shape. The Taper-Lok is designed  to completely fill the hole, but unlike the rivet, it fills the hole  without deforming the shank. Instead, the washer head nut  squeezes the metal with tremendous force against the tapered  walls of the hole. This creates radial compression around  the shank and vertical compression lines as the metals are  squeezed together. The combination of these forces generates  strength unequaled by any other fastener.  [Figure 7-56]  

# HI-LOK™ Fastening System  

The threaded end of the HI-LOK™ two-piece fastener  contains a hexagonal shaped recess. The hex tip of an Allen  wrench engages the recess to prevent rotation of the pin  while the collar is being installed. The pin is designed in two  basic head styles. For shear applications, the pin is made in  countersunk style and in a compact protruding head style. For  tension applications, the MS24694 countersunk and regular  protruding head styles are available.  

The self-locking, threaded HI-LOK™ collar has an internal  counterbore at the base to accommodate variations in material  thickness. At the opposite end of the collar is a wrenching  device that is torqued by the driving tool until it shears off  during installation, leaving the lower portion of the collar  seated with the proper torque without additional torque  inspection. This shear-off point occurs when a predetermined  preload or clamp-up is attained in the fastener during  installation.  

Note:   For these fasteners, “Preload” is defined as the  maximum tensile load experienced by a fastener in a joint  during the fastener installation sequence. Consequently, the

Figure 7-47.   CherryLOCK  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   rivet heads.  

term “Residual Tension” is defined as the remaining tensile  load experienced by a fastener in a joint after the fastener  installation sequence is complete, and after any residual  relaxation of the joint assembly.  

The advantages of HI-LOK™ two-piece fastener include its  lightweight, high fatigue resistance, high strength, and its  inability to be over-torqued. The pins, made from alloy steel,  corrosion-resistant steel, nickel, or titanium alloy, come in  many standard and oversized shank diameters. The collars are  made of aluminum alloy, corrosion-resistant steel, titanium,  or alloy steel. The collars have wrenching flats, fracture point,  threads, and a recess. The wrenching flats are used to install  the collar. The fracture point has been designed to allow the  wrenching flats to shear when the proper torque has been  reached. The threads match the threads of the pins and have  been formed into an ellipse that is distorted to provide the  locking action. The recess serves as a built-in washer. This  area contains a portion of the shank and the transition area  of the fastener.  

The hole shall typically be prepared so that the maximum  interference fit does not exceed 0.002-inch. This avoids  build up of excessive internal stresses in the work adjacent

to the hole. The HI-LOK™ pin has a slight radius under its  head to increase fatigue life. After drilling, deburr the edge  of the hole to allow the head to seat fully in the hole. The  HI-LOK™ is typically installed in interference fit holes for  aluminum structure and a clearance fit for steel, titanium,  and composite materials.  

# HI-TIGUE™ Fastening System  

The HI-TIGUE™ fastener offers all the benefits of the  HI-LOK™ fastening system along with a unique radius  contour on the thread lead-in, or a raised bead design that  enhances the fatigue performance of the structure making it  ideal for situations that require a controlled interference fit.  The HI-TIGUE™ fastener assembly consists of a pin and

collar. These pin rivets have a radius at the transition area.  During installation in an interference fit hole, the radius area  will “cold-work” the hole. These fastening systems can be  easily confused, and visual reference should not be used for  identification. Use part numbers to identify these fasteners.  [Figure 7-57]  

# HI-LITE™ Fastening System  

The HI-LITE™ fastener is similar in design and principle to  the HI-LOK™ fastener, has the controlled radius from full  diameter section to the threaded area of the HI-TIGUE™  fastener, and has a shorter transition area between the shank  and the first load-bearing thread. HI-LITE™ fasteners have  approximately one less thread. These differences reduce  the weight of the HI-LITE™ fastener without lessening  the shear strength. HI-LITE™ fasteners are available in the  same materials and head configurations as the HI-LOK™  system, and can also be installed in high interference like the  HI-TIGUE™ fastener. HI-LITE™ collars are also different  and thus are not interchangeable with HI-LOK™ collars or  HI-TIGUE™ collars.  

# Captive Fasteners  

Captive fasteners are used for quick removal of engine  nacelles, inspection panels, and areas where fast and easy  access is important. A captive fastener can turn in the body  in which it is mounted, but will not drop out when it is  unscrewed from the part it is holding. Some of the most  commonly used are the Dzus, Camloc, and Airloc.  

# Turn Lock Fasteners  

Turn lock fasteners are used to secure inspection plates, doors,  and other removable panels on aircraft. Turn lock fasteners are  

![](images/58bf9c01a6be03704d14c2b9c1e063a28716a973e023409567a30510b6c4d523.jpg)  
Figure 7-55.   Pin (Hi-Shear) rivet.  

also referred to by such terms as quick opening, quick action,  and stressed panel fasteners. The most desirable feature of  these fasteners is that they permit quick and easy removal  of access panels for inspection and servicing purposes. Turn  lock fasteners are manufactured and supplied by several  manufacturers under various trade names.  

# Dzus Fasteners  

The Dzus turn lock fastener consists of a stud, grommet, and  receptacle.  Figure 7-58  illustrates an installed Dzus fastener  and the various parts.  

The grommet is made of aluminum or aluminum alloy  material. It acts as a holding device for the stud. Grommets  can be fabricated from 1100 aluminum tubing, if none are  available from normal sources.  

![](images/51b4921db84a0efdc885425e5eb02e6b0830ab34b16f07fe92d3877622d32823.jpg)  
Figure 7-56.   Taper-Lok special fasteners  

The spring is made of steel, which is cadmium plated to  prevent corrosion. The spring supplies the force that locks  or secures the stud in place when two assemblies are joined.  

The studs are fabricated from steel and are cadmium plated.  They are available in three head styles: wing, flush, and oval.  Body diameter, length, and head type may be identified or  determined by the markings found on the head of the stud.  [Figure 7-59]  The diameter is always measured in sixteenths  of an inch. Stud length is measured in hundredths of an inch  and is the distance from the head of the stud to the bottom  of the spring hole.  

A quarter of a turn of the stud (clockwise) locks the  fastener. The fastener may be unlocked only by turning the  stud counterclockwise. A Dzus key or a specially ground  screwdriver locks or unlocks the fastener.  

# Camloc Fasteners  

Camloc fasteners are made in a variety of styles and designs.  Included among the most commonly used are the 2600, 2700,  40S51, and 4002 series in the regular line, and the stressed  panel fastener in the heavy-duty line. The latter is used in  stressed panels, which carry structural loads.  

![](images/852aecfa062c26cc6fc16daa2b6e039b60099e013b2653bccc3993a1c9952371.jpg)

fairings. It consists of three parts: a stud assembly, a grommet,  and a receptacle. Two types of receptacles are available: rigid  and floating.  [Figure 7-60]  

The stud and grommet are installed in the removable portion;  the receptacle is riveted to the structure of the aircraft. The  stud and grommet are installed in either a plain, dimpled,  countersunk, or counter bored hole, depending upon the  location and thickness of the material involved.  

A quarter turn (clockwise) of the stud locks the fastener.  The fastener can be unlocked only by turning the stud  

![](images/babde406085f207994d80ed2a3e34cc4e48dc8f54e912ada4cc011939cc41135.jpg)  
Figure 7-58.   Dzus fastener.  

# Airloc Fasteners  

The Airloc fastener consists of three parts: a stud, a cross pin,  and a stud receptacle.  [Figure 7-61]  The studs are manufactured  from steel and case hardened to prevent excessive wear. The  stud hole is reamed for a press fit of the cross pin.  

The total amount of material thickness to be secured with  the Airloc fastener must be known before the correct length  of stud can be selected for installation. The total thickness  of material that each stud satisfactorily locks together is  stamped on the head of the stud in thousandths of an inch  (0.040, 0.070, 0.190, and so forth). Studs are manufactured  in three head styles: flush, oval, and wing.  

The cross pin is manufactured from chrome-vanadium steel  and heat-treated to provide maximum strength, wear, and  holding power.  [Figure 7-61]  It should never be used the  second time; once removed from the stud, replace it with  a new pin.  

Receptacles for Airloc fasteners are manufactured in two  types: rigid and floating. Number—No. 2, No. 5, and No.  7, classifies sizes. They are also classified by the center-to- center distance between the rivet holes of the receptacle: No.  2 is  $\%$   inch; No. 5 is 1 inch; and No. 7 is  $1\%$   inch. Receptacles  are fabricated from high-carbon, heat-treated steel. An upper  wing assures ejection of the stud when unlocked and enables  the cross pin to be held in a locked position between the upper  wing, cam, stop, and wing detent, regardless of the tension  to which the receptacle is subjected.  

# Screws  

Screws are the most commonly used threaded fastening  devices on aircraft. They differ from bolts because as they  are generally made of lower strength materials. They can be  installed with a loose-fitting thread, and the head shapes are  made to engage a screwdriver or wrench. Some screws have  a clearly defined grip or unthreaded portion, while others are  threaded along their entire length.  

Several types of structural screws differ from the standard  structural bolts only in head style. The material in them is

Figure 7-60.   Camloc fastener.  

the same, and a definite grip length is provided. The AN525  washer head screw and the NAS220 through NAS227 series  are such screws.  

Commonly used screws are classified in four groups:  

1.	 Structural screws, which have the same strength as equal size bolts. 2.	 Machine screws, which include most types used for general repair. 3.	 Self-tapping screws, which are used for attaching lighter parts. 4. 	 Drive screws, which are not actually screws but nails.  They are driven into metal parts with a mallet or hammer and their heads are not slotted or recessed.  

# Structural Screws  

Structural screws are made of alloy steel, are properly heat- treated, and can be used as structural bolts. These screws  

![](images/d1fa4796741bace8fc249ca5174295f0aa667ed6a42f4ba010b7a3f8010a1c51.jpg)  
Figure 7-61.   Airloc fastener.  

are found in the NAS204 through NAS235 and AN509 and  AN525 series. They have a definite grip and the same shear  strength as a bolt of the same size. Shank tolerances are  similar to AN hex head bolts, and the threads are National  Fine. Structural screws are available with round, brazier,  or countersunk heads. Either a Phillips or a Reed & Prince  screwdriver drives the recessed head screws.  

The AN509   $(100^{\circ})$   flathead screw is used in countersunk  holes where a flush surface is necessary.  

The AN525 washer head structural screw is used where raised  heads are not objectionable. The washer head screw provides  a large contact area.  

# Machine Screws  

Machine screws are usually of the flathead (countersunk),  roundhead, or washer head types. These are general purpose  screws and are available in low-carbon steel, brass, corrosion- resistant steel, and aluminum alloy.  

Roundhead screws, AN515 and AN520, have either slotted  or recessed heads. The AN515 screw has coarse threads, and  the AN520 has fine threads.  

Countersunk machine screws are listed as AN505 and  AN510 for  $82^{\circ}$   and AN507 for  $100^{\circ}$  . The AN505 and AN510  correspond to the AN515 and AN520 roundhead in material  and usage.  

The fillister head screw, AN500 through AN503, is a general  purpose screw and is used as a cap screw in light mechanisms.  This could include attachments of cast aluminum parts, such  as gearbox cover plates.  

The AN500 and AN501 screws are available in low-carbon  steel, corrosion-resistant steel, and brass. The AN500 has  coarse threads, while the AN501 has fine threads. They have  no clearly defined grip length.  

Screws larger than No. 6 have a hole drilled through the head  for safetying purposes.  

The AN502 and AN503 fillister head screws are made of  heat-treated alloy steel, have a small grip, and are available in  fine and coarse threads. These screws are used as cap screws  where great strength is required. The coarse threaded screws  are commonly used as cap screws in tapped aluminum alloy  and magnesium castings because of the softness of the metal.  

# Self-Tapping Screws  

Machine self-tapping screws are listed as AN504 and AN506.  The AN504 screw has a roundhead, and the AN506 is   $82^{\circ}$  countersunk. These screws are used for attaching removable  parts, such as nameplates, to castings and parts in which the  screw cuts its own threads.  

AN530 and AN531 self-tapping sheet metal screws, such  as the Parker-Kalon Z-type sheet metal screw, are blunt on  the end. They are used in the temporary attachment of metal  for riveting, and in the permanent assembly of nonstructural  assemblies. Self-tapping screws should not be used to replace  standard screws, nuts, bolts, or rivets.  

Drive Screws  

Drive screws, AN535, correspond to the Parker-Kalon  U-type. They are plain head self-tapping screws used as cap  screws for attaching nameplates in castings and for sealing  drain holes in corrosion proofing tubular structures. They are  not intended to be removed after installation.  

# Identification & Coding for Screws  

The coding system used to identify screws is similar to that  used for bolts. There are AN and NAS screws. NAS screws  are structural screws. Part numbers 510, 515, 550, and so  on, catalog screws into classes, such as roundhead, flathead,  washer head, and so forth. Letters and digits indicate their  material composition, length, and thickness. Examples of  AN and NAS code numbers follow.  

AN501B-416-7 $\mathbf{AN}=$  Air Force-Navy standard   $501=$   fillister head, fine thread   $\mathbf{B}=$   brass  $416=\%$  -inch diameter  $7=\%$  -inch length  

The letter “D” in place of the “B” would indicate that the  material is 2017-T aluminum alloy. The letter “C” would  designate corrosion resistant steel. An “A” placed before the  material code letter would indicate that the head is drilled  for safetying.  

NAS144DH-22  $\mathrm{NAS}=$  National Aircraft Standard  $144\,{=}$   head style; diameter and thread— 1 ⁄ -28 bolt, internal  4 wrenching  $\mathrm{DH}=$  drilled head  $22=$   screw length in 16ths of an inch—  $.1\%$   inches long  

The basic NAS number identifies the part. The suffix letters  and dash numbers separate different sizes, plating material,  drilling specifications, and so forth. The dash numbers and  suffix letters do not have standard meanings. It is necessary  to refer to a specific NAS page in the Standards book for  the legend.  

# Riveted & Rivetless Nut Plates  

When access to the back of a screw or bolt installation is  impractical, riveted or rivetless nut plates are used to secure  the connection of panels. One example in aircraft this  technique is especially useful is to secure the floorboards to  the stringers and to each other.  

# Nut Plates  

Nuts that are made to be riveted in place in aircraft are called  nut plates. Their purpose is to allow bolts and screws to be  inserted without having to hold the nut. They are permanently  mounted to enable inspection panels and access doors to be  easily removed and installed. When many screws are used on  a panel, to make installation easier, normally floating anchor  nuts are used. The floating anchor nut fits into a small bracket,  which is riveted to the aircraft skin. The nut is free to move,  which makes it much easier to align it with the screw. For  production ease, sometimes ganged anchor nuts are used for  inspection panels. Ganged anchor nuts allow the nuts to float  in a channel, making alignment with the screw easy.  

Self-locking nut plates are made under several standards  and come in several shapes and sizes.  Figure 7-62  shows an  MS21078 two-lug nut plate with a nonmetallic insert and an  MS21047 lightweight, all-metal,  $450\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(232\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   nut plate.  Nut plates can also have three riveting points if the added  strength is required.  

# Rivnuts  

This is the trade name of a hollow, blind rivet made of 6053  aluminum alloy, counter bored and threaded on the inside.  One person using a special tool, which heads the rivet on the  blind side of the material, can install Rivnuts. The Rivnut is  threaded on the mandrel of the heading tool and inserted in  the rivet hole. The heading tool is held at right angles to the  material, the handle is squeezed, and the mandrel crank is  turned clockwise after each stroke. Continue squeezing the  handle and turning the mandrel crank of the heading tool until  a solid resistance is felt, which indicates that the rivet is set.  

The Rivnut is used primarily as a nut plate and in the  attachment of deicer boots to the leading edges of wings.  It may be used as a rivet in secondary structures or for  the attachment of accessories, such as brackets, fairings,  instruments, or soundproofing materials.  

Rivnuts are manufactured in two head types, each with  two ends: the flathead with open or closed end and the  countersunk head with open or closed end. All Rivnuts,  except the thin head countersunk type, are available with  or without small projections (keys) attached to the head to  keep the Rivnut from turning. Keyed Rivnuts are used as a  nut plate, while those without keys are used for straight blind  riveting repairs where no torque loads are imposed. A keyway  cutter is needed when installing Rivnuts that have keys.  

The countersunk style Rivnut is made with two different head  angles: the  $100^{\circ}$   with 0.048 and 0.063 inch head thickness and  the   $115^{\circ}$   with 0.063 inch head thickness. Each of these head  styles is made in three sizes: 6-32, 8-32, and 10-32. These  numbers represent the machine screw size of the threads on  the inside of the Rivnut. The actual outside diameters of the  shanks are  $\%$   inch for the 6-32 size,  $\%_{32}$   inch for the 8-32 size,  and  $\%$   inch for the 10-32 size.  

Open-end Rivnuts are the most widely used and are  recommended in preference to the closed end type wherever  possible. However, closed-end Rivnuts must be used in  pressurized compartments.  

Rivnuts are manufactured in six grip ranges. The minimum  

![](images/629a48e8e2d48327c0ed2e85d71a575608b41411dd526d29705584704b29c863.jpg)  
Figure 7-62.   Various nut plates.  

grip length is indicated by a plain head and the next higher  grip length by one radial dash mark on the head. Each  succeeding grip range is indicated by an additional radial  dash mark until five marks indicate the maximum range.  

Notice in  Figure 7-63  that some part number codes consist  of a “6,” an “8,” or a “10,” a “dash,” and two or three more  numbers. In some, the letters “K” or “KB” replaces the  dash. The first number indicates the machine screw size of  the thread, and the last two or three numbers indicate the  maximum grip length in thousandths of an inch. A dash  between the figures indicates that the Rivnut has an open  end and is keyless; a “B” in place of the dash means it has  a closed end and is keyless; a “K” means it has an open end  and has a key; and a “KB” indicates that it has a closed end  and a key. If the last two or three numbers are divisible by  five, the Rivnut has a flathead; if they are not divisible by  five, the Rivnut has a countersunk head.  

An example of a part number code is:  

10KB106  $10=$   Grip length  

$\mathbf{K}\mathbf{B}=$   Closed end and key   $106=$  Screw and thread size  

# Dill Lok-Skrus and Dill Lok-Rivets  

Dill “Lok-Skru” and “Lok-Rivet” are trade names for  internally-threaded rivets. They are used for blind attachment  of accessories, such as fairings, fillets, access door covers,  door and window frames, floor panels, and the like. Lok- Skrus and Lok-Rivets are like the Rivnut in appearance  and application; however, they come in two parts and  require more clearance on the blind side than the Rivnut to  accommodate the barrel.  [Figure 7-64]  

The Lok-Rivet and the Lok-Skru are alike in construction,  except the Lok-Skru is tapped internally for fastening an  accessory by using an attaching screw, whereas the Lok-Rivet is  not tapped and can be used only as a rivet. Since both Lok-Skrus  and Lok-Rivets are installed in the same manner, the following  discussion for the Lok-Skru also applies to the Lok-Rivet.  

The main parts of a Lok-Skru are the barrel, the head, and  an attachment screw. The barrel is made of aluminum alloy  and comes in either closed or open ends. The head is either  aluminum alloy or steel, and the attachment screw is made  of steel. All the steel parts are cadmium plated, and all of  aluminum parts are anodized to resist corrosion. When  installed, the barrel screws up over the head and grips the  metal on the blind side. The attaching screw is then inserted  if needed. There are two head types: the flathead and the  countersunk head. The Lok-Skru is tapped for 7-32, 8-32,  10-32, or 10-24 screws, and the diameters vary from 0.230  inch for 6-32 screws, to 0.292 inch for 10-32 screws. Grip  ranges vary from 0.010 inch to 0.225 inch.  

# Deutsch Rivets  

This rivet is a high-strength blind rivet used on late model  aircraft. It has a minimum shear strength of 75,000 psi and  can be installed by one person. The Deutsch rivet consists  of two parts: the stainless-steel sleeve and the hardened steel  drive pin.  [Figure 7-65]  The pin and sleeve are coated with  a lubricant and a corrosion inhibitor.  

The Deutsch rivet is available in diameters of  $\%,\,\%$  , or   $\%$    inch. Grip lengths for this rivet range from   $\%$   to 1 inch.  Some variation is allowed in grip length when installing the  rivet. For example, a rivet with a grip length of   $\%$   inch can  be used where the total thickness of materials is between  0.198 and 0.228 inch.  

When driving a Deutsch rivet, an ordinary hammer or a  pneumatic rivet gun and a flathead set are used. The rivet  is seated in the previously drilled hole, and then the pin is  driven into the sleeve. The driving action causes the pin to  exert pressure against the sleeve and forces the sides of the  sleeve out. This stretching forms a shop head on the end of  the rivet and provides positive fastening. The ridge on the  top of the rivet head locks the pin into the rivet as the last  few blows are struck.  

# Sealing Nut Plates  

When securing nut plates in pressurized aircraft and in fuel  cells, a sealing nut plate is used instead of the open-ended  variety previously described. Care must be taken to use  exactly the correct length of bolt or screw. If a bolt or screw  is too short, there is not enough threads to hold the device in  place. If the bolt or screw is too long, it penetrates the back  side of the nut plate and compromises the seal. Normally, a  sealant is also used to ensure complete sealing of the nut plate.  Check the manufacturer’s specifications for the acceptable  sealant to be used for sealing nut plates.  

# Hole Repair & Hole Repair Hardware  

Many of the blind fasteners are manufactured in oversized  diameters to accommodate slightly enlarged holes resulting  from drilling out the original fastener. When using rivets  

![](images/5071fbc11d65967f1e468864fff9d4986385366985d4b287a348ccd1750e903b.jpg)  

![](images/65cb4810b7a288861d096066a3f42f50d284d78147dbc2ee6f8a046e835be507.jpg)

Figure 7-64.   Internally-threaded rivet (Rivnut).  

or even bolts, care must be taken to ensure the hole is not  elongated or slanted.  

To reduce the chances of an incorrectly drilled rivet or bolt  hole, use a slightly smaller drill bit first, then enlarge to the  correct diameter. The last step to prepare the hole for the  fastener is to deburr the hole using either a very large drill  bit or a special deburring tool. This practice also works well  when drilling out a previously attached fastener. If the drill  bit does not exactly find the center of the rivet, bolt, or screw,  the hole can easily be elongated, but when using a smaller  drill bit, drill the head only off the fastener. Then the ring and  stem that is left can be pushed out with a pin punch of the  appropriate diameter. If an incorrectly drilled hole is found,  the options are to re-drill the hole to the next larger diameter  for an acceptable fastener or repair the hole using an Acres  fastener sleeve.  

# Repair of Damaged Holes with Acres Fastener  Sleeves  

Acres fastener sleeves are thin-wall tubular elements with  a flared end. The sleeves are installed in holes to accept  standard bolts and rivet-type fasteners. The existing fastener  holes are drilled   $\%4$   inch oversize for installation of the  

![](images/8d01d21ed2024be01de2a06196ef5b11c1a0d3bfc6d5fef1f7c5099027a44710.jpg)  
Figure 7-65.   Deutsch rivet.  

sleeves. The sleeves are manufactured in 1-inch increments.  Along their length, grooves provide a place to break or cut  off excess length to match fastener grip range. The grooves  also provide a place to hold adhesive or sealing agents when  bonding the sleeve into the hole.  

# Advantages & Limitations  

The sleeves are used in holes that must be drilled   $\%4$   inch  oversize to clean up corrosion or other damage. The oversize  hole with the sleeve installed allows the use of the original  diameter fastener in the repaired hole. The sleeves can be  used in areas of high galvanic corrosion where the corrosion  must be confined to a readily replaceable part. Oversizing of  holes reduces the net cross-sectional area of a part and should  not be done unless absolutely required.  

Consult the manufacturer of the aircraft, aircraft engine, or  aircraft component prior to repair have damaged holes with  Acres sleeves.  

# Identification  

The sleeve is identified by a standard code number that  represents the type and style of sleeve, a material code,  the fastener shank diameter, and surface finish code letter,  and grip tang for the sleeve.  [Figure 7-66]  The basic code  number represents the type and material of the sleeve. The  first dash number represents the diameter of the sleeve for  the fastener installed, and the second dash represents the  grip length of the sleeve. The required length of the sleeve  is determined on installation and the excess is broken off the  sleeve. A JK5512A-05N-10 is a  $100^{\circ}$   low profile head sleeve  of aluminum alloy. The diameter is for a  $\%_{32}$  -inch fastener  with no surface finish and is  $\%$   inch in length.  

# Hole Preparation  

Refer to  Figure 7-67  for drill number for standard or close  fit holes. Inspect hole after drilling to assure all corrosion is  removed before installing the sleeve. The hole must also be  the correct shape and free from burrs. The countersink must  be enlarged to receive the flare of the sleeve, so the sleeve  is flush with the surrounding surface.  

# Installation  

After selecting the correct type and diameter sleeve, use the  6501 sleeve breakoff tool for final installation length. Refer  to  Figure 7-67  for the sleeve breakoff procedure. The sleeve  may be installed with or without being bonded in the hole.  When bonding the sleeve in a hole, use MIL-S-8802A  1 ⁄ 2 sealant. Reinstall original size fastener and torque as required.  

# Sleeve Removal  

Sleeves not bonded in the hole may be removed by either  driving them out with a drift pin of the same diameter as  the outside diameter of the sleeve, or they may be deformed  and removed with a pointed tool. Bonded sleeves may be  removed by this method, but care should be used not to  damage the structure hole. If this method cannot be used,  drill the sleeves out with a drill 0.004 to 0.008 inch smaller  than the installation drill size. The remaining portion of the  sleeve after drilling can be removed using a pointed tool and  applying an adhesive solvent to the sealant.  

# Control Cables & Terminals  

Cables are the most widely used linkage in primary flight  control systems. Cable-type linkage is also used in engine  controls, emergency extension systems for the landing gear,  and various other systems throughout the aircraft.  

Cable-type linkage has several advantages over the other  types. It is strong and lightweight, and its flexibility makes it  easy to route through the aircraft. An aircraft cable has a high  mechanical efficiency and can be set up without backlash,  which is very important for precise control.  

Cable linkage also has some disadvantages. Tension must be  adjusted frequently due to stretching and temperature changes.  

Aircraft control cables are fabricated from carbon steel or  stainless steel.  

# Cable Construction  

The basic component of a cable is a wire. The diameter of  the wire determines the total diameter of the cable. Several  wires are preformed into a helical or spiral shape and then  formed into a strand. These preformed strands are laid around  a straight center strand to form a cable.  

Cable designations are based on the number of strands and the  number of wires in each strand. The most common aircraft  cables are the  $7\times7$   and   $7\times19$  .  

The   $7\,\times\,7$   cable consists of seven strands of seven wires  each. Six of these strands are laid around the center strand.  [Figure 7-68]  This is a cable of medium flexibility and is used  for trim tab controls, engine controls, and indicator controls.  

The   $7\times19$   cable is made up of seven strands of 19 wires  each. Six of these strands are laid around the center strand.  [Figure 7-68]  This cable is extra flexible and is used in  primary control systems and in other places where operation  over pulleys is frequent.  

Aircraft control cables vary in diameter, ranging from   $\%$   to   $\%$   inch. The diameter is measured as shown in  Figure 7-68 .  

Cable Fittings  

Cables may be equipped with several different types of  fittings, such as terminals, thimbles, bushings, and shackles. Terminal fittings are generally of the swaged type. They are  available in the threaded end, fork end, eye end, single shank  ball end, and double shank ball end. The threaded end, fork  end, and eye end terminals are used to connect the cable to  a turnbuckle, bell crank, or other linkage in the system. The  ball end terminals are used for attaching cables to quadrants  and special connections where space is limited.  Figure 7-69   illustrates the various types of terminal fittings.  

The thimble, bushing, and shackle fittings may be used  in place of some types of terminal fittings when facilities  and supplies are limited and immediate replacement of the  cable is necessary.  

# Turnbuckles  

A turnbuckle assembly is a mechanical screw device  consisting of two threaded terminals and a threaded barrel.  [Figure 7-70]  

Turnbuckles are fitted in the cable assembly for making  minor adjustments in cable length and for adjusting cable  tension. One of the terminals has right-hand threads and the  other has left-hand threads. The barrel has matching right-  and left-hand internal threads. The end of the barrel with the  left-hand threads can usually be identified by a groove or  knurl around that end of the barrel.  

When installing a turnbuckle in a control system, it is  necessary to screw both terminals an equal number of turns  into the barrel. It is also essential that all turnbuckle terminals  be screwed into the barrel until not more than three threads  are exposed on either side of the turnbuckle barrel.  

After a turnbuckle is properly adjusted, it must be safetied.  The methods of safetying turnbuckles are discussed later in  this chapter.  

# Push-Pull Tube Linkage  

Push-pull tubes are used as linkage in various types of  mechanically-operated systems. This type linkage eliminates  the problem of varying tension and permits the transfer of  either compression or tension stress through a single tube.  

A push-pull tube assembly consists of a hollow aluminum  alloy or steel tube with an adjustable end fitting and a check  nut at either end.  [Figure 7-71]  The check nuts secure the end  fittings after the tube assembly has been adjusted to its correct  length. Push-pull tubes are generally made in short lengths  to prevent vibration and bending under compression loads.

# Safetying Methods  

To ensure fasteners do not separate from their nuts or holding  ends, various safetying methods are used in aircraft from  heavy aircraft to gliders to recreational aircraft. Safetying is  the process of securing all aircraft, bolts, nuts, screws, pins,  and other fasteners so that they do not work loose due to  

![](images/012777856a8facf2b31284535ee61a4054893384ce492d57edc2be7ab2cc242c.jpg)  
Figure 7-69.   Types of terminal fittings.  

of safetying equipment on an aircraft is necessary to perform  maintenance and inspection.  

There are various methods of safetying aircraft parts. The  most widely used methods are safety wire, cotter pins, lock  washers, snap rings, and special nuts, such as self-locking  nuts, pal nuts, and jam nuts. Some of these nuts and washers  have been previously described in this chapter.  

# Pins  

The three main types of pins used in aircraft structures are  the taper pin, flathead pin, and cotter pin. Pins are used in  shear applications and for safetying. Roll pins are finding  increasing uses in aircraft construction.  

# Taper Pins  

Plain and threaded taper pins (AN385 and AN386) are used  in joints that carry shear loads and where absence of play is  essential. The plain taper pin is drilled and usually safetied  with wire. The threaded taper pin is used with a taper pin  washer (AN975) and shear nut (safetied with a cotter pin or  safety clip) or self-locking nut.  

# Flathead Pin  

Commonly called a Clevis pin, the flathead pin (MS20392)  is used with tie rod terminals and in secondary controls,  which are not subject to continuous operation. The pin is  customarily installed with the head up so that if the cotter  pin fails or works out, the pin remains in place.  

# Cotter Pins  

The AN380 cadmium-plated, low-carbon steel cotter pin  is used for safetying bolts, screws, nuts, other pins, and in  various applications where such safetying is necessary. The  AN381 corrosion-resistant steel cotter pin is used in locations  where nonmagnetic material is required or in locations where  resistance to corrosion is desired.  

Roll Pins The roll pin is a pressed fit pin with chamfered ends. It is

tubular in shape and is slotted the full length of the tube.  The pin is inserted with hand tools and is compressed as it  is driven into place. Pressure exerted by the roll pin against  the hole-walls keeps it in place until deliberately removed  with a drift punch or pin punch.  

# Safety Wiring  

Safety wiring is the most positive and satisfactory method of  safetying cap screws, studs, nuts, bolt heads, and turnbuckle  barrels, which cannot be safetied by any other practical  means. It is a method of wiring together two or more units  in such a manner that any tendency of one to loosen is  counteracted by the tightening of the wire.  

# Nuts, Bolts, & Screws  

Nuts, bolts, and screws are safety wired by the single wire  or double twist method. The double twist method is the  most common method of safety wiring. The single wire  method may be used on small screws in a closely spaced  closed geometrical pattern, on parts in electrical systems,  and in places that are extremely difficult to reach. Safety  wiring should always be per conventional methods or as  required by the manufacturer, especially for Light Sport  Aircraft (LSA).  

Figure 7-72  is an illustration of various methods that are  commonly used in safety wiring nuts, bolts, and screws.  Careful study of  Figure 7-72  shows that:  

•	 Examples 1, 2, and 5 illustrate the proper method of  safety wiring bolts, screws, square-head plugs, and  similar parts when wired in pairs. •	 Example 3 illustrates several components wired in series.  

•	 Example 4 illustrates the proper method of wiring  castellated nuts and studs. (Note that there is no loop  around the nut.) •	 Examples 6 and 7 illustrate a single-threaded component  wired to a housing or lug. •	 Example 8 illustrates several components in a closely  spaced closed geometrical pattern using a single wire  method.  

When drilled head bolts, screws, or other parts are grouped  together, they are more conveniently safety wired to each  other in a series rather than individually. The number of  nuts, bolts, or screws that may be safety wired together is  dependent on the application. For instance, when safety  wiring widely spaced bolts by the double twist method, a  group of three should be the maximum number in a series.  

When safety wiring closely spaced bolts, the number that can  be safety wired by a 24-inch length of wire is the maximum  in a series. The wire is arranged so that if the bolt or screw  begins to loosen, the force applied to the wire is in the  tightening direction.  

Parts being safety wired should be torqued to recommend  values and the holes aligned before attempting the safetying  operation. Never over torque or loosen a torqued nut to align  safety wire holes.  

# Oil Caps, Drain Cocks, & Valves  

These units are safety wired as shown in  Figure 7-73 . In  the case of the oil cap, the wire is anchored to an adjacent  fillister head screw.  

![](images/23dbd28a8a752892a7af33189ccef875cabf59aa36c91614b76fe0f68e1aac76.jpg)  
Figure 7-75.   Safetying turnbuckles: (A) clip-locking method and (B) wire-wrapping method.  

![Figure 7-76.   Turnbuckle safetying guide. ](images/edd60a32d7788d518ba1cc033fc14e079202163b546ed81809829f37147a9afe.jpg)  

This system applies to any other unit that must be safety wired  individually. Ordinarily, anchorage lips are conveniently  located near these individual parts. When such provision is  not made, the safety wire is fastened to some adjacent part  of the assembly.  

# Electrical Connectors  

Under conditions of severe vibration, the coupling nut of a  connector may vibrate loose and, with sufficient vibration,  the connector may come apart. When this occurs, the circuit  carried by the cable opens. The proper protective measure  to prevent this occurrence is by safety wiring as shown in  Figure 7-74 . The safety wire should be as short as practicable  and must be installed in such a manner that the pull on the  wire is in the direction that tightens the nut on the plug.  

# Turnbuckles  

After a turnbuckle has been properly adjusted, it must be  safetied. There are several methods of safetying turnbuckles;  however, only two methods are discussed in this section.  These methods are illustrated in  Figure 7-75 . The clip locking  method is used only on the most modern aircraft. The older  type aircraft still use the type turnbuckles that require the  wire wrapping method.  

# Double Wrap Method  

Of the methods using safety wire for safetying turnbuckles,  the double wrap method is preferred, although the single wrap  methods described are satisfactory. The method of double  wrap safetying is shown in  Figure 7-75 . Use two separate  lengths of the proper wire as shown in  Figure 7-76 .  

Run one end of the wire through the hole in the barrel of the  turnbuckle and bend the ends of the wire toward opposite ends  of the turnbuckle. Then pass the second length of the wire into  the hole in the barrel and bend the ends along the barrel on  the side opposite the first. Then pass the wires at the end of  the turnbuckle in opposite directions through the holes in the  turnbuckle eyes or between the jaws of the turnbuckle fork,  as applicable. Bend the laid wires in place before cutting off  the wrapped wire. Wrap the remaining length of safety wire  at least four turns around the shank and cut it off. Repeat the  procedure at the opposite end of the turnbuckle.  

When a swaged terminal is being safetied, pass the ends  of both wires, if possible, through the hole provided in the  terminal for this purpose and wrap both ends around the  shank as described above.  

If the hole is not large enough to allow passage of both wires,  pass the wire through the hole, and loop it over the free end  of the other wire, and then wrap both ends around the shank  as described.  

# Single Wrap Method  

The single wrap safetying methods described in the following  paragraphs are acceptable but are not the equal of the double  wrap methods.  

Pass a single length of wire through the cable eye or fork or  through the hole in the swaged terminal at either end of the  

![](images/14356f581cfdf8898a6ca5a03a11e820d50ca37c5fff8ccd5a643040795aafc4.jpg)  
Figure 7-77.   Cotter pin installation.  

turnbuckle assembly. Spiral each of the wire ends in opposite  directions around the first half of the turnbuckle barrel so  that the wires cross each other twice. Thread both wire ends  through the hole in the middle of the barrel so that the third  crossing of the wire ends is in the hole. Again, spiral the two  wire ends in opposite directions around the remaining half  of the turnbuckle, crossing them twice. Then, pass one wire  end through the cable eye or fork, or through the hole in the  swaged terminal. In the manner described above, wrap both  wire ends around the shank for at least four turns each, cutting  off the excess wire.  

An alternate to the above method is to pass one length of  

![](images/1f3be0c03b003043ed7b4f32723daf7a8d0081c376a50f4c894d1c6418cce597.jpg)  
Figure 7-78.   External type snap ring with safety wire installation.  

wire through the center hole of the turnbuckle and bend the  wire ends toward opposite ends of the turnbuckle. Then pass  each wire end through the cable eye or fork, or through the  hole in the swaged terminal and wrap each wire end around  the shank for at least four turns, cutting off the excess wire.  After safetying, no more than three threads of the turnbuckle  threaded terminal should be exposed.  

# General Safety Wiring Rules  

When using the safety wire method of safetying, the  following general rules should be followed:  

1.	 Pigtail of   $\%$   to   $\%$   inch (three to six twists) should be  made at the end of the wiring. This pigtail must be bent  back or under to prevent it from becoming a snag. 2.	 The safety wire must be new upon each application. 3. 	 When castellated nuts are to be secured with safety wire,  tighten the nut to the low side of the selected torque  range, unless otherwise specified, and if necessary,  continue tightening until a slot aligns with the hole. 4. 	 All safety wires must be tight after installation, but not  under such tension that normal handling or vibration  breaks the wire. 5.	 The wire must be applied so that all pull exerted by  the wire tends to tighten the nut. 6.	 Twists should be tight and even, and the wire between  the nuts as taut as possible without over twisting. 7.	 The safety wire should always be installed and  twisted so that the loop around the head stays down  and does not tend to come up over the bolt head,  causing a slack loop.  

# Cotter Pin Safetying  

Cotter pin installation is shown in  Figure 7-77 . Castellated  nuts are used with bolts that have been drilled for cotter pins.  The cotter pin should fit neatly into the hole with very little  side play.  

The following general rules apply to cotter pin safetying:  

1.	 The prong bent over the bolt end should not extend  beyond the bolt diameter. (Cut it off if necessary.) 2.	 The prong bent down should not rest against the  surface of the washer. (Again, cut it off if necessary.) 3.	 If the optional wraparound method is used, the prongs  should not extend outward from the sides of the nut. 4.	 All prongs should be bent over a reasonable radius.  Sharp angled bends invite breakage. Tapping lightly  with a mallet is the best method of bending the prongs.  

# Snap Rings  

A snap ring is a ring of metal, either round or flat in cross  section, which is tempered to have spring like action. This  spring like action holds the snap ring firmly seated in a groove.  The external types are designed to fit in a groove around the  outside of a shaft or cylinder and may be safety wired. Safety  wiring of an external type snap ring is shown in  Figure 7-78 .  The internal types fit in a groove inside a cylinder and are  never safetied. A special type of pliers is designed to install  each type of snap ring. Snap rings can be reused as long as  they retain their shape and spring-like action.  

# Chapter 8 Cleaning & Corrosion Control  

# Corrosion  

Many aircraft structures are made of metal, and the most  insidious form of damage to those structures is corrosion.  From the moment the metal is manufactured, it must be  protected from the deleterious effects of the environment that  surrounds it. This protection can be the introduction of certain  elements into the base metal, creating a corrosion-resistant  alloy, or the addition of a surface coating of a chemical  conversion coating, metal, or paint. While in use, additional  moisture barriers, such as viscous lubricants and protectants,  may be added to the surface.  

The introduction of airframes built primarily of composite  components has not eliminated the need for careful  monitoring of aircraft with regard to corrosion. The airframe  itself may not be subject to corrosion; however, the use  of metal components and accessories within the airframe  means the aviation maintenance technician (AMT) must be  on the alert for the evidence of corrosion when inspecting  any aircraft.  

This chapter provides an overview to the problems associated  with aircraft corrosion. For more in-depth information on  the subject, refer to the latest edition of the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 43-4, Corrosion  Control for Aircraft. The AC is an extensive handbook that  deals with the sources of corrosion particular to aircraft  structures, as well as steps the AMT can take in the course  of maintaining aircraft that have been attacked by corrosion.  

Metal corrosion is the deterioration of the metal by chemical  or electrochemical attack. This type of damage can take place  internally, as well as on the surface. As in the rotting of wood,  this deterioration may change the smooth surface, weaken  the interior, or damage or loosen adjacent parts.  

Water or water vapor containing salt combines with oxygen  in the atmosphere to produce the main source of corrosion  in aircraft. Aircraft operating in a marine environment, or  in areas where the atmosphere contains industrial fumes  that are corrosive, are particularly susceptible to corrosive  attacks.  [Figure 8-1]  

If left unchecked, corrosion can cause eventual structural  failure. The appearance of corrosion varies with the metal.  

[Figure 8-2]  On the surface of aluminum alloys and  magnesium, it appears as pitting and etching and is often  combined with a gray or white powdery deposit. On copper  and copper alloys, the corrosion forms a greenish film; on  steel, a reddish corrosion byproduct commonly referred to  as rust. When the gray, white, green, or reddish deposits  are removed, each of the surfaces may appear etched and  pitted, depending upon the length of exposure and severity  of attack. If these surface pits are not too deep, they may not  significantly alter the strength of the metal; however, the  pits may become sites for crack development, particularly if  the part is highly stressed. Some types of corrosion burrow  between the inside of surface coatings and the metal surface,  spreading until the part fails.  

# Factors Affecting Corrosion  

Many factors affect the type, speed, cause, and seriousness of  metal corrosion. Some of these factors that influence metal  corrosion and the rate of corrosion are:  

1.	 Type of metal  2.	 Heat-treatment and grain direction  3.	 Presence of a dissimilar, less corrodible metal  4.	 Anodic and cathodic surface areas (in galvanic  corrosion)  5.	 Temperature  6.	 Presence of electrolytes (hard water, salt water, battery  fluids, etc.)  7.	 Availability of oxygen  8.	 Presence of biological organisms  9.	 Mechanical stress on the corroding metal 10.	 Time of exposure to a corrosive environment   11.	 Lead/graphite pencil marks on aircraft surface metals  

# Pure Metals  

Most pure metals are not suitable for aircraft construction and  are used only in combination with other metals to form alloys.  Most alloys are made up entirely of small crystalline regions  called grains. Corrosion can occur on surfaces of those  regions that are less resistant and also at boundaries between  regions, resulting in the formation of pits and intergranular  corrosion. Metals have a wide range of corrosion resistance.  

The most active metals (those that lose electrons easily), such  as magnesium and aluminum, corrode easily. The most noble  metals (those that do not lose electrons easily), such as gold  and silver, do not corrode easily.  

# Climate  

The environmental conditions that an aircraft is maintained  and operated under greatly affects corrosion characteristics.  In a predominately marine environment (with exposure to sea  water and salt air), moisture-laden air is considerably more  detrimental to an aircraft than it would be if all operations  were conducted in a dry climate. Temperature considerations  are important, because the speed of electrochemical attack is  increased in a hot, moist climate.  

# Geographical Location  

The flight routes and bases of operation expose some  airplanes to more corrosive conditions than others. The  operational environment of an aircraft may be categorized  as mild, moderate, or severe with respect to the corrosion  severity of the operational environment. The corrosion  severity of the operational environments in North America are  identified in  Figure 8-3.  Additional maps for other locations  around the world are published in AC 43-4.  

The corrosion severity of any particular area may be increased  by many factors, including airborne industrial pollutants,  chemicals used on runways and taxiways to prevent ice  formation, humidity, temperatures, prevailing winds from a  corrosive environment, etc. Suggested intervals for cleaning,  inspection, lubrication, and preservation when located in mild  zones are every 90 days, moderate zones every 45 days, and  severe zones every 15 days.  

# Foreign Material  

Among the controllable factors that affect the onset and  spread of corrosive attack is foreign material that adheres to  the metal surfaces. Such foreign material includes:  

![](images/4f64259c6399e45b6451f6dfeffde3f232f760a130187e812fb27fba87a1a296.jpg)  
Figure 8-1.   Seaplane operations.  

•	 Soil and atmospheric dust •	 Oil, grease, and engine exhaust residues •	 Salt water and salt moisture condensation •	 Spilled battery acids and caustic cleaning solutions •	 Welding and brazing flux residues  

# Micro-organisms  

Slimes, molds, fungi and other living organisms (some  microscopic) can grow on damp surfaces. Once they are  established, the area tends to remain damp, increasing the  possibility of corrosion.  

# Manufacturing Processes  

Manufacturing processes, such as machining, forming, welding,  or heat-treatment, can leave stresses in aircraft parts. The  residual stress can cause cracking in a corrosive environment  when the threshold for stress corrosion is exceeded.  

It is important that aircraft be kept clean. How often and to  what extent an aircraft must be cleaned depends on several  factors, including geographic location, model of aircraft, and  type of operation.  

# Types of Corrosion  

There are two general classifications of corrosion that  cover most of the specific forms: direct chemical attack and  electrochemical attack. In both types of corrosion, the metal  is converted into a metallic compound, such as an oxide,  hydroxide, or sulfate. The corrosion process involves two  simultaneous changes: the metal that is attacked or oxidized  suffers what is called anodic change, and the corrosive agent  is reduced and is considered as undergoing cathodic change.  

# Direct Chemical Attack  

Direct chemical attack, or pure chemical corrosion, is an  attack resulting from direct exposure of a bare surface to  caustic liquid or gaseous agents. Unlike electrochemical  attack where anodic and cathodic changes take place a  measurable distance apart, the changes in direct chemical  attack occur simultaneously at the same point. The most  common agents causing direct chemical attack on aircraft  are: spilled battery acid or fumes from batteries; residual  flux deposits resulting from inadequately cleaned, welded,  brazed, or soldered joints; and entrapped caustic cleaning  solutions.  [Figure 8-4]  

With the introduction of sealed lead-acid batteries and the use  of nickel-cadmium batteries, spilled battery acid is becoming  less of a problem. The use of these closed units lessens the  hazards of acid spillage and battery fumes.  

Many types of fluxes used in brazing, soldering, and welding  

![](images/d864642ee497db349716c1b703d23681e5ac0f94c4f3d998f1992c57968c7110.jpg)  

are corrosive, chemically attacking the metals or alloys that  they are used with. Therefore, it is important to remove  residual flux from the metal surface immediately after the  joining operation. Flux residues are hygroscopic in nature,  absorbing moisture, and unless carefully removed, tend to  cause severe pitting.  

Caustic cleaning solutions in concentrated form are  kept tightly capped and as far from aircraft as possible.  Some cleaning solutions used in corrosion removal are,  in themselves, potentially corrosive agents. Therefore,  particular attention must be directed toward their complete  removal after use on aircraft. Where entrapment of the  cleaning solution is likely to occur, use a noncorrosive  cleaning agent, even though it is less efficient.  

# Electrochemical Attack  

Corrosion is a natural occurrence that attacks metal by  chemical or electrochemical action, converting it back to a  metallic compound. The following four conditions must exist  before electrochemical corrosion can occur.  [Figure 8-5]  

1.	 A metal subject to corrosion (anode) 2.	 A dissimilar conductive material (cathode) that has less tendency to corrode  

3.	 Presence of a continuous, conductive liquid path (electrolyte)  

4.	 Electrical contact between the anode and the cathode (usually in the form of metal to metal contact, such as rivets, bolts, and corrosion)  

Elimination of any one of these conditions stops  electrochemical corrosion.  

NOTE: Paint can mask the initial stages of corrosion.  Since corrosion products occupy more volume than the  original metal, painted surfaces must be inspected often for  irregularities, such as blisters, flakes, chips, and lumps.  

An electrochemical attack may be likened chemically to  the electrolytic reaction that takes place in electroplating,  anodizing, or in a dry cell battery. The reaction in this corrosive  attack requires a medium, usually water, that is capable of  conducting a tiny current of electricity. When a metal comes  in contact with a corrosive agent and is also connected by a  liquid or gaseous path that electrons flow through, corrosion  begins as the metal decays by oxidation.  [Figure 8-5]  During  the attack, the quantity of corrosive agent is reduced and,  if not renewed or removed, may completely react with the  

![](images/befad60fc611765b5b1ad3bb0e0da623d06e80540310613878e898eee9c00d09.jpg)  
Figure 8-3.   North America corrosion severity chart.  

metal becoming neutralized. Different areas of the same  metal surface have varying levels of electrical potential and,  if connected by a conductor such as salt water, sets up a series  of corrosion cells and corrosion will commence.  

All metals and alloys are electrically active and have a  specific electrical potential in a given chemical environment.  This potential is commonly referred to as the metal’s  “nobility.”  [Figure 8-6]  The less noble a metal is, the more  easily it can be corroded. The metals chosen for use in aircraft  structures are a studied compromise with strength, weight,  corrosion resistance, workability, and cost balanced against  the structure’s needs.  

The constituents in an alloy also have specific electrical  potentials that are generally different from each other.  Exposure of the alloy surface to a conductive, corrosive  medium causes the more active metal to become anodic and  the less active metal to become cathodic, thereby establishing  conditions for corrosion. These are called local cells. The  greater the difference in electrical potential between the two  metals, the greater the severity of a corrosive attack if the  proper conditions are allowed to develop.  

![](images/e37210445e906e8958b1844be0933ee8c87156bd3a2d1664366163b130631aa3.jpg)  
Figure 8-4.   Direct chemical attack in a battery compartment.  

The conditions for these corrosion reactions are the presence  of a conductive fluid and metals having a difference in  potential. If, by regular cleaning and surface refinishing,  the medium is removed and the minute electrical circuit  eliminated, corrosion cannot occur. This is the basis for  effective corrosion control. The electrochemical attack is  responsible for most forms of corrosion on aircraft structure  and component parts.  

# Forms of Corrosion  

There are many forms of corrosion. The form of corrosion  depends on the metal involved, its size and shape, its  specific function, atmospheric conditions, and the corrosion  producing agents present. Those described in this section  are the more common forms found on airframe structures.  

# Surface Corrosion  

General surface corrosion (also referred to as uniform etch  or uniform attack corrosion) is the most common form of  corrosion. Surface corrosion appears as a general roughening,  etching, or pitting of the surface of a metal, frequently  accompanied by a powdery deposit of corrosion products.  Surface corrosion may be caused by either direct chemical or  electrochemical attack. Sometimes corrosion spreads under  the surface coating and cannot be recognized by either the  roughening of the surface or the powdery deposit. Instead,  closer inspection reveals the paint or plating is lifted off the  surface in small blisters that result from the pressure of the  underlying accumulation of corrosion products.  [Figure 8-7]  

# Filiform Corrosion  

Filiform corrosion is a special form of oxygen concentration  cell that occurs on metal surfaces having an organic  coating system. It is recognized by its characteristic worm- like trace of corrosion products beneath the paint film.  [Figure 8-8]  Polyurethane finishes are especially susceptible  to filiform corrosion. Filiform occurs when the relative  humidity of the air is between 78–90 percent, and the surface  is slightly acidic. This corrosion usually attacks steel and  aluminum surfaces. The traces never cross on steel, but they

cross under one another on aluminum, making the damage  deeper and more severe for aluminum. If the corrosion is not  removed, the area treated, and a protective finish applied,  the corrosion can lead to intergranular corrosion, especially  around fasteners and at seams.  

Filiform corrosion can be removed using glass bead blasting  material with portable abrasive blasting equipment or  sanding. Filiform corrosion can be prevented by storing  aircraft in an environment with a relative humidity below 70  percent, using coating systems having a low rate of diffusion  for oxygen and water vapors, and by washing the aircraft to  remove acidic contaminants from the surface, such as those  created by pollutants in the air.  

# Pitting Corrosion  

Pitting corrosion is one of the most destructive and intense  forms of corrosion. It can occur in any metal but is most  common on metals that form protective oxide films, such  as aluminum and magnesium alloys. It is first noticeable  as a white or gray powdery deposit, similar to dust, which  blotches the surface. When the deposit is cleaned away, tiny  holes or pits can be seen in the surface. These small surface  openings may penetrate deeply into structural members and  cause damage completely out of proportion to its surface  appearance.  [Figure 8-9]  

# Dissimilar Metal Corrosion  

Extensive pitting damage may result from contact between  dissimilar metal parts in the presence of a conductor. While  surface corrosion may or may not be taking place, a galvanic  action, not unlike electroplating, occurs at the points or areas  of contact where the insulation between the surfaces has  broken down or been omitted. This electrochemical attack  can be very serious because, in many instances, the action  is taking place out of sight, and the only way to detect it  prior to structural failure is by disassembly and inspection.  [Figure 8-10]  

The contamination of a metal’s surface by mechanical means  can also induce dissimilar metal corrosion. The improper use  of steel cleaning products, such as steel wool or a steel wire  brush on aluminum or magnesium, can force small pieces  of steel into the metal being cleaned, causing corrosion and  ruining the adjoining surface. Carefully monitor the use of  nonwoven abrasive pads, so that pads used on one type of  metal are not used again on a different metal surface.  

# Concentration Cell Corrosion  

Concentration cell corrosion, (also known as crevice  corrosion) is corrosion of metals in a metal-to-metal joint,  corrosion at the edge of a joint even though the joined metals  are identical, or corrosion of a spot on the metal surface  covered by a foreign material. Metal ion concentration cells,  

![](images/4d6b59793945584020996a6dc165cb99ec9b1405ab88575b7dd0850d857cf21e.jpg)  
Figure 8-6.   The galvanic series of metals and alloys.  

oxygen concentration cells, and active-passive cells are three  general types of concentration cell corrosion.  

# Metal Ion Concentration Cells  

The solution may consist of water and ions of the metal that  are in contact with water. A high concentration of metal ions  normally exists under faying surfaces where the solution is  stagnant and a low concentration of metal ions exist adjacent  to the crevice, created by the faying surface.  [Figure 8-11]  An  electrical potential exists between the two points: the area  of the metal in contact with the low concentration of metal  ions is anodic and corrodes; the area in contact with the high  metal ion concentration is cathodic and does not show signs  of corrosion.  

# Oxygen Concentration Cells  

The solution in contact with the metal surface normally  contains dissolved oxygen. An oxygen cell can develop  at any point where the oxygen in the air is not allowed to  diffuse into the solution, thereby creating a difference in  oxygen concentration between two points. Typical locations  of oxygen concentration cells are under gaskets, wood,  rubber, and other materials in contact with the metal surface.  Corrosion occurs at the area of low oxygen concentration  (anode). Alloys such as stainless steel are particularly  susceptible to this type of crevice corrosion.  [Figure 8-12]  

# Active-Passive Cells  

Metals that depend on a tightly adhering passive film, usually  an oxide for corrosion protection, are prone to rapid corrosive  attack by active-passive cells. The corrosive action usually  starts as an oxygen concentration cell. The passive film is  broken beneath the dirt particle exposing the active metal to  corrosive attack. An electrical potential will develop between  the large area of the passive film and the small area of the  active metal, resulting in rapid pitting.  [Figure 8-13]  

![](images/302fc468dfd3ef8bc48680374d31d22c81657678fcd38a6177b1faa7ffb5a776.jpg)

Figure 8-8.   Filiform corrosion.  

# Intergranular Corrosion  

This type of corrosion is an attack along the grain boundaries of  an alloy and commonly results from a lack of uniformity in the  alloy structure. Aluminum alloys and some stainless steels are  particularly susceptible to this form of electrochemical attack.  [Figure 8-14]  The lack of uniformity is caused by changes  that occur in the alloy during the heating and cooling process  of the material’s manufacturing. Intergranular corrosion  may exist without visible surface evidence. High-strength  aluminum alloys, such as 2014 and 7075, are more susceptible  to intergranular corrosion if they have been improperly heat- treated and then exposed to a corrosive environment.  

# Exfoliation Corrosion  

Exfoliation corrosion is an advanced form of intergranular  corrosion and shows itself by lifting up the surface grains  of a metal by the force of expanding corrosion products  occurring at the grain boundaries just below the surface.  [Figure 8-15]  It is visible evidence of intergranular corrosion  and is most often seen on extruded sections where grain  thickness is usually less than in rolled forms. This type of  corrosion is difficult to detect in its initial stage. Extruded  components, such as spars, can be subject to this type of  corrosion. Ultrasonic and eddy current inspection methods  are being used with a great deal of success.  

# Stress-Corrosion/Cracking  

This form of corrosion involves a constant or cyclic stress  acting in conjunction with a damaging chemical environment.  The stress may be caused by internal or external loading.  [Figure 8-16]  Internal stress may be trapped in a part of  structure during manufacturing processes, such as cold- working or by unequal cooling from high temperatures.  Most manufacturers follow these processes with a stress  relief operation. Even so, sometimes stress remains trapped.  The stress may be externally introduced in part structure by  riveting, welding, bolting, clamping, press fit, etc. If a slight  mismatch occurs or a fastener is over-torqued, internal stress

Figure 8-10.   Dissimilar metal corrosion.  

is present. Internal stress is more important than design stress,  because stress corrosion is difficult to recognize before it has  overcome the design safety factor. The level of stress varies  from point to point within the metal. Stresses near the yield  strength are generally necessary to promote stress corrosion  cracking. However, failures may occur at lower stresses.  

Specific environments have been identified that cause stress  corrosion cracking of certain alloys.  

1.	 Salt solutions and sea water cause stress corrosion  cracking of high-strength, heat-treated steel and  aluminum alloys. 2.	 Methyl alcohol-hydrochloric acid solutions cause  stress corrosion cracking of some titanium alloys. 3.	 Magnesium alloys may stress corrode in moist air.  

Stress corrosion may be reduced by applying protective  coatings, stress relief heat-treatments, using corrosion  inhibitors, or controlling the environment. Shot peening a  metal surface increases resistance to stress corrosion cracking  by creating compressive stresses on the surface which should  be overcome by applied tensile stress before the surface  sees any tension load. Therefore, the threshold stress level  is increased.

Figure 8-13.   Active-passive cell.  

# Fretting Corrosion  

Fretting corrosion is a particularly damaging form of  corrosive attack that occurs when two mating surfaces,  normally at rest with respect to one another, are subject to  slight relative motion. It is characterized by pitting of the  surfaces and the generation of considerable quantities of  finely divided debris. Since the restricted movements of the  two surfaces prevent the debris from escaping very easily,  an extremely localized abrasion occurs.  [Figure 8-17] The presence of water vapor greatly increases this type of  deterioration. If the contact areas are small and sharp, deep  grooves resembling brinell markings or pressure indentations  may be worn in the rubbing surface. As a result, this type  of corrosion on bearing surfaces has also been called false  brinelling. The most common example of fretting corrosion  is the smoking rivet found on engine cowling and wing  skins. This is one corrosion reaction that is not driven by an  electrolyte, and in fact, moisture may inhibit the reaction. A  smoking rivet is identified by a black ring around the rivet.  

# Fatigue Corrosion  

Fatigue corrosion involves cyclic stress and a corrosive  

![](images/d519da06fefe6c99b8b6ea8fb7fcbc95e10d8f6ba294a209a839fe2b8dfa37d1.jpg)  
Figure 8-15.   Exfoliation corrosion.  

environment. Metals may withstand cyclic stress for an  infinite number of cycles so long as the stress is below  the endurance limit of the metal. Once the limit has been  exceeded, the metal eventually cracks and fails from metal  fatigue. However, when the part or structure undergoing  cyclic stress is also exposed to a corrosive environment, the  stress level for failure may be reduced many times. Thus,  failure occurs at stress levels that can be dangerously low  depending on the number of cycles assigned to the life- limited part.  

Fatigue corrosion failure occurs in two stages. During the  first stage, the combined action of corrosion and cyclic stress  damages the metal by pitting and crack formations to such  a degree that fracture by cyclic stress occurs, even if the  corrosive environment is completely removed. The second  stage is essentially a fatigue stage where failure proceeds by  propagation of the crack (often from a corrosion pit or pits).  It is controlled primarily by stress concentration effects and  the physical properties of the metal. Fracture of a metal part  due to fatigue corrosion generally occurs at a stress level far  

![](images/db1aaf6b1a2345d8a4147d41b03e3567dadb46e4ca23000e7ab4b84eaefd3a41.jpg)

Figure 8-16.   Stress corrosion cracking.  

below the fatigue limit of an uncorroded part, even though  the amount of corrosion is relatively small.  

# Galvanic Corrosion  

Galvanic corrosion occurs when two dissimilar metals  make electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte.  [Figure 8-18]  The rate which corrosion occurs depends on  the difference in the activities. The greater the difference  in activity, the faster corrosion occurs. The rate of galvanic  corrosion also depends on the size of the parts in contact. If  the surface area of the corroding metal is smaller than the  surface area of the less active metal, corrosion is rapid and  severe. When the corroding metal is larger than the less active  metal, corrosion is slow and superficial.  

# Common Corrosive Agents  

Substances that cause corrosion of metals are called corrosive  agents. The most common corrosive agents are acids, alkalies,  and salts. The atmosphere and water, the two most common  media for these agents, may also act as corrosive agents.  

•	 Acids—moderately strong acids severely corrode  most of the alloys used in airframes. The most  destructive are sulfuric acid (battery acid), halogen  acids (hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and hydrobromic),  nitrous oxide compounds, and organic acids found in  the wastes of humans and animals.  •	 Alkalies—as a group, alkalies are not as corrosive  as acids. Aluminum and magnesium alloys are  exceedingly prone to corrosive attack by many  alkaline solutions unless the solutions contain a  corrosion inhibitor. Substances particularly corrosive  to aluminum are washing soda, potash (wood ashes),  and lime (cement dust). Ammonia, an alkali, is  an exception because aluminum alloys are highly  resistant to it. •	 Salts—most salt solutions are good electrolytes and  can promote corrosive attack. Some stainless-steel  alloys are resistant to attack by salt solutions but  aluminum alloy, magnesium alloys, and other steels are  

![](images/c90de3ec80a724f45b3d9089ab925ae2b59742b179b0a96dbcbdcd4b00b0abea.jpg)  
Figure 8-17.   Fretting corrosion.  

extremely vulnerable. Exposure of airframe materials  to salts or their solutions is extremely undesirable.  

•	 Atmosphere—the major atmospheric corrosive agents  are oxygen and airborne moisture. Corrosion often  results from the direct action of atmospheric oxygen  and moisture on metal, and the presence of additional  moisture often accelerates corrosive attack, particularly  on ferrous alloys. However, the atmosphere may  also contain other corrosive gases and contaminants,  particularly industrial and marine salt spray.  •	 Water—the corrosiveness of water depends on the  type and quantity of dissolved mineral and organic  impurities and dissolved gasses (particularly oxygen)  in the water. One characteristic of water that determines  its corrosiveness is the conductivity or ability to act as  an electrolyte and conduct a current. Physical factors,  such as water temperature and velocity, also have a  direct bearing on its corrosiveness.  

# Preventive Maintenance  

Much has been done to improve the corrosion resistance  of aircraft, such as improvements in materials, surface  treatments, insulation, and modern protective finishes. All of  these have been aimed at reducing the overall maintenance  effort, as well as improving reliability. In spite of these  improvements, corrosion and its control is a very real problem  that requires continuous preventive maintenance. During any  corrosion control maintenance, consult the Safety Data Sheet  (SDS) for information on any chemicals used in the process.  

Corrosion preventive maintenance includes the following  specific functions:  

1.	 Adequate cleaning 2.	 Thorough periodic lubrication 3.	 Detailed inspection for corrosion and failure of  

protective systems  

4.	 Prompt treatment of corrosion and touch up of  damaged paint areas 5.	 Accurate record keeping and reporting of material or  design deficiencies to the manufacturer and the FAA 6.	 Use of appropriate materials, equipment, technical  publications, and adequately-training personnel 7. 	 Maintenance of the basic finish systems 8.	 Keeping drain holes free of obstructions 9.	 Daily draining of fuel cell sumps 10.	 Daily wipe down of exposed critical areas 11.	 Sealing of aircraft against water during foul weather  and proper ventilation on warm, sunny days 12.	 Replacing deteriorated or damaged gaskets and  sealants to avoid water intrusion and/or entrapment 13.	 Maximum use of protective covers on parked aircraft  

After any period where regular corrosion preventive  maintenance is interrupted, the amount of maintenance  required to repair accumulated corrosion damage and bring  the aircraft back up to standard is usually quite high.  

# Inspection  

Inspection for corrosion is a continuing problem and must  be handled daily. Overemphasizing a particular corrosion  problem when it is discovered and then forgetting about  corrosion until the next crisis is an unsafe, costly, and  troublesome practice. Most scheduled maintenance checklists  are complete enough to cover all parts of the aircraft or  engine, thus no part of the aircraft goes uninspected. Use these  checklists as a general guide when an area is to be inspected  for corrosion. Through experience, one learns that most  aircraft have trouble areas where, despite routine inspection  and maintenance, corrosion still sets in.  

![](images/4f4cd26b2626c5c41717e4ad43936047d15e21f589ccbd2b7f42d360f52ab150.jpg)  
Figure 8-18.   Galvanic corrosion.  

the area to be inspected. A general visual inspection of the  area follows using a flashlight, inspection mirror, and a   $^{5-}$  l0 X  magnifying glass. The general inspection is to look for  obvious defects and suspected areas. A detailed inspection  of damage or suspected areas found during the general  inspection follows.  

Visual inspection is the most widely used technique and  is an effective method for the detection and evaluation of  corrosion. Visual inspection employs the eyes to look directly  at an aircraft surface or at a low angle of incidence to detect  corrosion. Using the sense of touch is also an effective  inspection method for the detection of hidden, well-developed  corrosion. Other tools used during the visual inspection are  mirrors, optical micrometers, and depth gauges.  

Sometimes the inspection areas are obscured by structural  members, equipment installations, or for some reason are  awkward to check visually. Adequate access for inspection  must be obtained by removing access panels and adjacent  equipment, cleaning the area as necessary, and removing  loose or cracked sealants and paints. Mirrors, borescopes, and  fiber optics are useful in providing the means of observing  obscure areas.  

In addition to visual inspection, there are several NDI  methods, such as liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, eddy  current, x-ray, ultrasonic, and acoustical emission, that may  be of value in the detection of corrosion. These methods have  limitations and must be performed only by qualified and  certified NDI personnel. Eddy current, x-ray, and ultrasonic  inspection methods require properly calibrated (each time  used) equipment and a controlling reference standard to  obtain reliable results.  

In addition to routine maintenance inspections, amphibians  or seaplanes must be checked daily and critical areas cleaned  or treated, as necessary.  

# Corrosion Prone Areas  

Discussed briefly in this section are most of the corrosion  problem areas common to all aircraft. These areas should  be cleaned, inspected, and treated more frequently than less  corrosion prone areas. This information is not necessarily  complete and may be amplified and expanded to cover  the special characteristics of the particular aircraft model  involved by referring to the applicable maintenance manual.  

# Exhaust Trail Areas  

Both jet and reciprocating engine exhaust deposits are very  corrosive and give particular trouble where gaps, seams,  hinges, and fairings are located downstream from the exhaust  pipes or nozzles.  [Figure 8-19]  Deposits may be trapped  and not reached by normal cleaning methods. Pay special  attention to areas around rivet heads and in skin lap joints  and other crevices. Remove and inspect fairings and access  plates in the exhaust areas. Do not overlook exhaust deposit  buildup in remote areas, such as the empennage surfaces.  Buildup in these areas is slower and may not be noticed until  corrosive damage has begun.  

# Battery Compartments and Battery Vent Openings  

Despite improvements in protective paint finishes and in  methods of sealing and venting, battery compartments  continue to be corrosion prone areas. Fumes from overheated  electrolyte are difficult to contain and spread to adjacent  cavities, causing a rapid corrosive attack on all unprotected  metal surfaces. Battery vent openings on the aircraft skin  should be included in the battery compartment inspection and  maintenance procedure. If aircraft batteries with electrolytes,  sulfuric acid, or potassium hydroxide are in use, their leakage  will cause corrosion. Regular cleaning and neutralization of  acid deposits minimizes corrosion from this cause. Consult  the applicable maintenance manuals for the particular  aircraft to determine the type of battery installed and the  recommended maintenance.  

# Bilge Areas  

These are natural collection points for waste hydraulic fluids,  water, dirt, and odds and ends of debris. Residual oil quite  often masks small quantities of water that settle to the bottom  and set up a hidden chemical cell.  

Instead of using chemical treatments for the bilge water,  current float manufacturers recommend the diligent  maintenance of the internal coatings applied to the float’s  interior during manufacture. In addition to chemical  conversion coatings applied to the surface of the sheet metal  and other structural components and to sealants installed in  lap joints during construction, the interior compartments are  painted to protect the bilge areas. When seaplane structures  are repaired or restored, this level of corrosion protection  must be maintained.  

# Lavatories, Buffets, & Galleys  

These areas, particularly deck areas behind lavatories,  sinks, and ranges, where spilled food and waste products  may collect if not kept clean, are potential trouble spots.  Even if some contaminants are not corrosive in themselves,  they attract and retain moisture and, in turn, cause corrosive  attack. Pay attention to bilge areas located under galleys and  lavatories. Clean these areas frequently and maintain the  protective sealant and paint finishes.  

# Wheel Well and Landing Gear  

More than any other area on the aircraft, this area probably  receives more punishment due to mud, water, salt, gravel,  and other flying debris.  [Figure 8-20]  Because of the many  complicated shapes, assemblies, and fittings, complete  area paint film coverage is difficult to attain and maintain.  A partially applied preservative tends to mask corrosion  rather than prevent it. Due to heat generated by braking  action, preservatives cannot be used on some main landing  gear wheels.  

During inspection of this area, pay particular attention to the  following trouble spots:  

1.	 Magnesium wheels, especially around bolt heads, lugs,  and wheel web areas, for the presence of entrapped  water or its effects 2.	 Exposed rigid tubing, especially at B-nuts and ferrules,  under clamps and tubing identification tapes 3.	 Exposed position indicator switches and other  electrical equipment 4.	 Crevices between stiffeners, ribs, and lower skin  surfaces that are typical water and debris traps 5.	 Axle interiors 6.	 Exposed surfaces of struts, oleos, arms, links, and  attaching hardware (bolts, pins, etc.)  

# Water Entrapment Areas  

Design specifications require that aircraft have drains installed  in all areas where water may collect. Daily inspection of low  point drains is a standard requirement. If this inspection is  neglected, the drains may become ineffective because of  accumulated debris, grease, or sealants.  

![](images/b64182474790ad09628868e0b2f793c27dab6f60fce0502170ac7edb2228a943.jpg)  
Figure 8-19.   Exhaust nozzle area.  

# Engine Frontal Areas & Cooling Air Vents  

These areas are being constantly abraded with airborne dirt  and dust, bits of gravel from runways, and rain erosion,  leading to removal of the protective finish. Furthermore,  cores of radiator coolers, reciprocating engine cylinder  fins, etc., may not be painted due to the requirement for  heat dissipation. Engine accessory mounting bases usually  have small area of unpainted magnesium or aluminum on  the machined-mounted surfaces. Inspection of these areas  must include all sections in the cooling air path, with special  attention to places where salt deposits may be built up during  marine operations. It is imperative that incipient corrosion be  inhibited and that paint touchup and hard film preservative  coatings are maintained on seaplane and amphibian engine  surfaces at all times.  

# Wing Flap & Spoiler Recesses  

Dirt and water may collect in flap and spoiler recesses  unnoticed, because they are normally retracted. For this  reason, these recesses are potential corrosion problem areas.  Inspect these areas with the spoilers and flaps in the fully  deployed position.  

# External Skin Areas  

External aircraft surfaces are readily visible and accessible  for inspection and maintenance. Even here, certain types  of configurations or combinations of materials become  troublesome under certain operating conditions and require  special attention.  

Relatively little corrosion trouble is experienced with  magnesium skins if the original surface finish and insulation  are adequately maintained. Trimming, drilling, and riveting  destroy some of the original surface treatment and can  never be completely restored by touchup procedures. Any  inspection for corrosion must include all magnesium skin  surfaces with special attention to edges, areas around  fasteners, and cracked, chipped, or missing paint.  

Piano-type hinges are prime spots for corrosion due to the  dissimilar metal contact between the steel pin and aluminum  hinge. They are also natural traps for dirt, salt, and moisture.  Inspection of hinges must include lubrication and actuation  through several cycles to ensure complete lubricant  penetration. Use water-displacing lubricants when servicing  piano hinges.  [Figures 8-21  and  8-22]  

Corrosion of metal skins joined by spot welding is the result  of the entrance and entrapment of corrosive agents between  the layers of metal. This type of corrosion is evidenced  by corrosion products appearing at the crevices where the  corrosive agents enter. More advanced corrosive attack  causes skin buckling and eventual spot weld fracture. Skin  buckling in its early stages may be detected by sighting along  spot welded seams or by using a straightedge. The only  technique for preventing this condition is to keep potential  moisture entry points, including seams and holes created  by broken spot welds, filled with a sealant or a suitable  preservative compound.  

# Electronic & Electrical Compartments  

Electronic and electrical compartments cooled by ram air or  compressor bleed air are subjected to the same conditions  common to engine and accessory cooling vents and engine  frontal areas. While the degree of exposure is less, because  a lower volume of air passing through and special design  features incorporated to prevent water formation in enclosed  spaces, this is still a trouble area that requires special attention.  

Circuit breakers, contact points, and switches are extremely  sensitive to moisture and corrosive attack, thus inspection is  required for these conditions as thoroughly as design permits.  If design features hinder examination of these items while  in the installed condition, inspection is accomplished after  component removal for other reasons.  

# Miscellaneous Trouble Areas  

Helicopter rotor heads and gearboxes, in addition to being  constantly exposed to the elements, contain bare steel  surfaces, many external working parts, and dissimilar metal  contacts. Inspect these areas frequently for evidence of  corrosion. The proper maintenance, lubrication, and the use  of preservative coatings can prevent corrosion in these areas.  

All control cables, whether plain carbon steel or corrosion-  resistant steel, are to be inspected to determine their condition  at each inspection period. In this process, inspect cables for  corrosion by random cleaning of short sections with solvent  soaked cloths. If external corrosion is evident, relieve tension  

![](images/56ef6ddd90ae9852df66d5d97c6f2193d513da5198a8ad598c617c0e426792ef.jpg)  
Figure 8-20.   The landing gear area should be cleaned and inspected  more frequently than other areas.  

and check the cable for internal corrosion. Replace cables  that have internal corrosion. Remove light external corrosion  with a nonwoven abrasive pad lightly soaked in oil or,  alternatively, a steel wire brush. When corrosion products  have been removed, recoat the cable with preservative.  

# Corrosion Removal  

In general, any complete corrosion treatment involves  cleaning and stripping of the corroded area, removing as  much of the corrosion products as practicable, neutralizing  any residual materials remaining in pits and crevices,  restoring protective surface films, and applying temporary  or permanent coatings or paint finishes.  

Repair of corrosion damage includes removal of all corrosion  and corrosion products. When the corrosion damage is  severe and exceeds the damage limits set by the aircraft or  parts manufacturer, the part must be replaced. The following  paragraphs deal with the correction of corrosive attack on  aircraft surface and components where deterioration has not  progressed to the point requiring rework or structural repair  of the part involved.  

Several standard methods are available for corrosion  removal. The methods normally used to remove corrosion are  mechanical and chemical. Mechanical methods include hand  sanding using abrasive mat, abrasive paper, or metal wool,  and powered mechanical sanding, grinding, and buffing,  using abrasive mat, grinding wheels, sanding discs, and  abrasive rubber mats. However, the method used depends  upon the metal and the degree of corrosion.  

# Surface Cleaning and Paint Removal  

The removal of corrosion includes removal of surface finishes  covering the attacked or suspected area. To assure maximum  efficiency of the stripping compound, the area must be  

![](images/cc8709ac3bcf4b7e826a1f71a8149b283ef49c7f90f709842ad0ee052eb97e23.jpg)

cleaned of grease, oil, dirt, or preservatives. This preliminary  cleaning operation is also an aid in determining the extent  of the spread of the corrosion, since the stripping operation  is held to the minimum consistent with full exposure of the  corrosion damage. Extensive corrosion spread on any panel  is to be corrected by fully treating the entire section.  

The selection of the type of materials to be used in cleaning  depends on the nature of the matter to be removed. Modern  environmental standards encourage the use of water-based,  non-toxic cleaning compounds whenever possible. In some  locations, local or state laws may require the use of such  products, and prohibit the use of solvents that contain volatile  organic compounds (VOCs). Where permitted, dry cleaning  solvent (P-D-680) may be used for removing oil, grease, or  soft preservative compounds. For heavy-duty removal of  thick or dried preservatives, other compounds of the solvent  emulsion type are available.  

The use of a general purpose, water soluble stripper can be  used for most applications. There are other methods for paint  removal that have minimal impact upon the aircraft structure,  and are considered “environmentally friendly.”  

Wherever practicable, chemical paint removal from any  large area is to be accomplished outside (in open air) and  preferably in shaded areas. If inside removal is necessary,  adequate ventilation must be assured. Synthetic rubber  surfaces, including aircraft tires, fabric, and acrylics, must  be thoroughly protected against possible contact with paint  remover. Care must be exercised in using paint remover,  especially around gas or watertight seam sealants, since  the stripper tends to soften and destroy the integrity of  these sealants.  

Mask off any opening that would permit the stripping  compound to get into aircraft interiors or critical cavities.  Paint stripper is toxic and contains ingredients harmful to  both skin and eyes. Therefore, wear rubber gloves, aprons  of acid repellent material, and goggle type eyeglasses. The  following is a general stripping procedure:  

1.	 Brush the entire area to be stripped with a cover of  stripper to a depth of  $\%"$   to  1 ⁄ ". Any paintbrush makes  16 a satisfactory applicator, except that the bristles will be  loosened by the effect of paint remover on the binder,  and the brush must not be used for other purposes after  being exposed to paint remover.  

2.	 Allow the stripper to remain on the surface for a  sufficient length of time to wrinkle and lift the paint.  This may be from 10 minutes to several hours,  depending on temperature, humidity, and the condition  of the paint coat being removed. Scrub the surface with  a bristle brush saturated with paint remover to further  loosen finish that may still be adhering to the metal.  

3.	 Reapply the stripper as necessary in areas where the  paint remains tightly adhered or where the stripper has  dried, and repeat the above process. Only nonmetallic  scrapers are to be used to assist in removing persistent  paint finishes. Nonwoven abrasive pads intended for  paint stripping may also prove to be useful in removing  the loosened paint.  

4.	 Remove the loosened paint and residual stripper by  washing and scrubbing the surface with water and  a broom, brush, or fresh nonwoven abrasive pad. If  water spray is available, use a low to medium pressure  stream of water directly on the area being scrubbed.  If steam-cleaning equipment is available and the area  is sufficiently large, cleaning may be accomplished  using this equipment together with a solution of steam- cleaning compound. On small areas, any method may  be used that assures complete rinsing of the cleaned  area. Use care to dispose of the stripped residue in  accordance with environmental laws.  

# Fairing or Blending Reworked Areas  

All depressions resulting from corrosion rework must be  faired or blended with the surrounding surface. Fairing can  be accomplished as follows:  

1.	 Remove rough edges and all corrosion from the  damaged area. All dish-outs must be elliptically  shaped with the major axis running spanwise on wings  and horizontal stabilizers, longitudinally on fuselages,  and vertically on vertical stabilizers.  2.	 In critical and highly stressed areas, all pits remaining  after the removal of corrosion products must be  blended out to prevent stress risers that may cause  

stress corrosion cracking.  [Figure 8-23]  On a non- critical structure, it is not necessary to blend out pits  remaining after removal of corrosion products by  abrasive blasting, since this results in unnecessary  metal removal.  

Rework depressions by forming smoothly blended dish-outs,  using a ratio of 20:1, length to depth.  [Figure 8-24]  In areas  having closely-spaced, multiple pits, intervening material  must be removed to minimize surface irregularity or  waviness.  [Figure 8-25]  Steel nut-plates and steel fasteners  are to be removed before blending corrosion out of aluminum  structure. Steel or copper particles embedded in aluminum  can become a point of future corrosion. All corrosion products  must be removed during blending to prevent reoccurrence  of corrosion.  

# Corrosion of Ferrous Metals  

One of the most familiar types of corrosion is ferrous oxide  (rust), generally resulting from atmospheric oxidation of  steel surfaces. Some metal-oxides protect the underlying  base metal, but rust is not a protective coating in any sense  of the word. Its presence actually promotes additional attack  by attracting moisture from the air and acting as a catalyst  for additional corrosion. If complete control of the corrosive  attack is to be realized, all rust must be removed from steel  surfaces.  

Rust first appears on bolt heads, hold-down nuts, or other  unprotected aircraft hardware.  [Figure 8-26]  Its presence in  these areas is generally not dangerous and has no immediate  effect on the structural strength of any major components.  The residue from the rust may also contaminate other ferrous  components, promoting corrosion of those parts. The rust is  indicative of a need for maintenance and of possible corrosive  attack in more critical areas. It is also a factor in the general  appearance of the equipment. When paint failures occur or  mechanical damage exposes highly-stressed steel surfaces  to the atmosphere, even the smallest amount of rusting is  potentially dangerous in these areas and must be removed  and controlled. Rust removal from structural components,  followed by an inspection and damage assessment, must be  done as soon as feasible.  [Figure 8-27]  

# Mechanical Removal of Iron Rust  

The most practicable means of controlling the corrosion  of steel is the complete removal of corrosion products  by mechanical means and restoring corrosion preventive  coatings. Except on highly-stressed steel surfaces, the use  of abrasive papers and compounds, small power buffers and  buffing compounds, hand wire brushing, or steel wool are  all acceptable cleanup procedures. However, it should be  recognized that in any such use of abrasives, residual rust  usually remains in the bottom of small pits and other crevices.  It is practically impossible to remove all corrosion products  by abrasive or polishing methods alone. As a result, once a  part cleaned in such a manner has rusted, it usually corrodes  again more easily than it did the first time.  

The introduction of variations of the nonwoven abrasive pad  has also increased the options available for the removal of  surface rust.  [Figure 8-28]  Flap wheels, pads intended for  use with rotary or oscillating power tools, and hand-held  nonwoven abrasive pads all can be used alone or with light  oils to remove corrosion from ferrous components.  

# Chemical Removal of Rust  

As environmental concerns have been addressed in recent  years, interest in noncaustic chemical rust removal has  increased. A variety of commercial products that actively  remove the iron oxide without chemically etching the  base metal are available and can be considered for use. If  at all possible, the steel part is removed from the airframe  for treatment, as it can be nearly impossible to remove all  residue. The use of any caustic rust removal product requires  the isolation of the part from any nonferrous metals during  treatment and probably inspection for proper dimensions.

Figure 8-24.   Blend of corrosion as a single depression.  

# Chemical Surface Treatment of Steel  

There are approved methods for converting active rust to  phosphates and other protective coatings. Other commercial  preparations are effective rust converters where tolerances  are not critical and where thorough rinsing and neutralizing  of residual acid is possible. These situations are generally  not applicable to assembled aircraft, and the use of chemical

inhibitors on installed steel parts is not only undesirable, but  also very dangerous. The danger of entrapment of corrosive  solutions and the resulting uncontrolled attack, that could  occur when such materials are used under field conditions,  outweigh any advantages to be gained from their use.  

# Removal of Corrosion from Highly Stressed Steel  Parts  

Any corrosion on the surface of a highly-stressed steel part is  potentially dangerous, and the careful removal of corrosion  products is required. Surface scratches or change in surface  structure from overheating can also cause sudden failure of  these parts. Corrosion products must be removed by careful  processing, using mild abrasive papers, such as rouge or fine  grit aluminum oxide or fine buffing compounds on cloth  buffing wheels. Nonwoven abrasive pads can also be used.  It is essential that steel surfaces not be overheated during  buffing. After careful removal of surface corrosion, reapply  protective paint finishes immediately. The use of chemical  corrosion removers is prohibited without engineering  authorization, because high-strength steel parts are subject  to hydrogen embrittlement.

# Corrosion of Aluminum & Aluminum Alloys  

Aluminum and aluminum alloys are the most widely used  material for aircraft construction. Aluminum appears high  in the electro-chemical series of elements and corrodes  very easily. However, the formation of a tightly-adhering  oxide film offers increased resistance under most corrosive  conditions. Most metals in contact with aluminum form  couples that undergo galvanic corrosion attack. The alloys  of aluminum are subject to pitting, intergranular corrosion,  and intergranular stress corrosion cracking. In some cases,  the corrosion products of metal in contact with aluminum are  corrosive to aluminum. Therefore, aluminum and its alloys  must be cleaned and protected.  

Corrosion on aluminum surfaces is usually quite obvious,  since the products of corrosion are white and generally more  voluminous than the original base metal. Even in its early  stages, aluminum corrosion is evident as general etching,  pitting, or roughness of the aluminum surfaces.  

NOTE: Aluminum alloys commonly form a smooth surface  oxidation that is from 0.001" to   $0.0025"$   thick. This is not  considered detrimental. The coating provides a hard-shell  barrier to the introduction of corrosive elements. Such  oxidation is not to be confused with the severe corrosion  discussed in this paragraph.  

General surface attack of aluminum penetrates relatively  slowly, but speeds up in the presence of dissolved salts.  Considerable attack can usually take place before serious  loss of structural strength develops.  

At least three forms of attack on aluminum alloys are  particularly serious: the penetrating pit-type corrosion  through the walls of aluminum tubing, stress-corrosion  cracking of materials under sustained stress, and intergranular  corrosion, which is characteristic of certain improperly heat- treated aluminum alloys.  

In general, corrosion of aluminum can be more effectively  

![](images/90edeef276a43dd50e0a55dc039d4a06fd6ee7022ebc5ba83b35fd2810736a9a.jpg)

treated in place compared to corrosion occurring on other  structural materials used in aircraft. Treatment includes the  mechanical removal of as much of the corrosion products  as practicable and the inhibition of residual materials by  chemical means, followed by the restoration of permanent  surface coatings.  

# Treatment of Unpainted Aluminum Surfaces  

Relatively pure aluminum has considerably more corrosion  resistance when compared with the stronger aluminum alloys.  To take advantage of this characteristic, a thin coating of  relatively pure aluminum is applied over the base aluminum  alloy. The protection obtained is good and the pure-aluminum  clad surface, commonly called “Alclad,” can be maintained in  a polished condition. In cleaning such surfaces, however, care  must be taken to prevent staining and marring of the exposed  aluminum. More important from a protection standpoint,  avoid unnecessary mechanical removal of the protective  Alclad layer and the exposure of the more susceptible  aluminum alloy base material. A typical aluminum corrosion  treatment sequence follows:  

1.	 Remove oil and surface dirt from the aluminum  surface using any suitable mild cleaner. Use caution  when choosing a cleaner. Many commercial consumer  products are actually caustic enough to induce  corrosion if trapped between aluminum lap joints.  Choose a neutral pH product.  

2.	 Hand polish the corroded areas with fine abrasives  or with metal polish. Metal polish intended for use  on clad aluminum aircraft surfaces must not be used  on anodized aluminum, since it is abrasive enough  to actually remove the protective anodized film. It  effectively removes stains and produces a highly  polished, lasting surface on unpainted Alclad. If a  surface is particularly difficult to clean, a cleaner  and brightener compound for aluminum can be used  

before polishing to shorten the time and lessen the  effort necessary to get a clean surface.  

3.	 Treat any superficial corrosion present using an  inhibitive wipe down material. An alternate treatment  is processing with a solution of sodium dichromate and  chromium trioxide. Allow these solutions to remain  on the corroded area for 5 to 20 minutes, and then  remove the excess by rinsing and wiping the surface  dry with a clean cloth.  

4.	 Overcoat the polished surfaces with waterproof wax.  

Aluminum surfaces that are to be subsequently painted can be  exposed to more severe cleaning procedures and can also be  given more thorough corrective treatment prior to painting.  The following sequence is generally used:  

1.	 Thoroughly clean the affected surfaces of all soil  and grease residues prior to processing. Any general  aircraft cleaning procedure may be used. 2.	 If residual paint film remains, strip the area to be  treated. Procedures for the use of paint removers and  the precautions to observe were previously mentioned  in this chapter under “Surface Cleaning and Paint  Removal.” 3.	 Treat superficially corroded areas with a 10 percent  solution of chromic acid and sulfuric acid. Apply the  solution by swab or brush. Scrub the corroded area  with the brush while it is still damp. While chromic  acid is a good inhibitor for aluminum alloys, even  when corrosion products have not been completely  removed, it is important that the solution penetrate to  the bottom of all pits and underneath any corrosion  that may be present. Thorough brushing with a stiff  fiber brush loosens or removes most existing corrosion  and assures complete penetration of the inhibitor into  crevices and pits. Allow the chromic acid to remain  in place for at least 5 minutes, and then remove the  excess by flushing with water or wiping with a wet  cloth. There are several commercial chemical surface  treatment compounds similar to the type described  above that may also be used.  

4.	 Dry the treated surface and restore recommended  permanent protective coatings, as required in  accordance with the aircraft manufacturer’s procedures.  Restoration of paint coatings must immediately follow  any surface treatment performed. In any case, make  sure that corrosion treatment is accomplished or is  reapplied on the same day that paint refinishing is  scheduled.  

# Treatment of Anodized Surfaces  

As previously stated, anodizing is a common surface  treatment of aluminum alloys. When this coating is damaged  in service, it can only be partially restored by chemical  surface treatment. Therefore, avoid destruction of the oxide  film in the unaffected area when performing any corrosion  correction of anodized surfaces. Do not use steel wool or steel  wire brushes. Do not use severe abrasive materials.  

Nonwoven abrasive pads have generally replaced aluminum  wool, aluminum wire brushes, or fiber bristle brushes as the  tools used for cleaning corroded anodized surfaces. Care must  be exercised in any cleaning process to avoid unnecessary  breaking of the adjacent protective film. Take every  precaution to maintain as much of the protective coating as  practicable. Otherwise, treat anodized surfaces in the same  manner as other aluminum finishes. Chromic acid and other  inhibitive treatments can be used to restore the oxide film.  

# Treatment of Intergranular Corrosion in Heat‑Treated  Aluminum Alloy Surfaces  

As previously described, intergranular corrosion is an attack  along grain boundaries of improperly or inadequately heat- treated alloys, resulting from precipitation of dissimilar  constituents following heat-treatment. In its most severe form,  actual lifting of metal layers (exfoliation) occurs.  [Figure 8-15]  

More severe cleaning is a must when intergranular corrosion  is present. The mechanical removal of all corrosion products  and visible delaminated metal layers must be accomplished  to determine the extent of the destruction and to evaluate the  remaining structural strength of the component. Corrosion  depth and removal limits have been established for some  aircraft. Any loss of structural strength must be evaluated  prior to repair or replacement of the part. If the manufacturer’s  limits do not adequately address the damage, a designated  engineering representative (DER) can be brought in to assess  the damage.  

# Corrosion of Magnesium Alloys  

Magnesium is the most chemically active of the metals used  in aircraft construction and is the most difficult to protect.  When a failure in the protective coating does occur, the  prompt and complete correction of the coating failure is  imperative if serious structural damage is to be avoided.  Magnesium attack is probably the easiest type of corrosion  to detect in its early stages, since magnesium corrosion  products occupy several times the volume of the original  magnesium metal destroyed. The beginning of attack shows  as a lifting of the paint film and white spots on the magnesium  surface. These rapidly develop into snow-like mounds or  even “white whiskers.”  [Figure 8-29]  Reprotection involves  the removal of corrosion products, the partial restoration of  surface coatings by chemical treatment, and a reapplication  of protective coatings.  

# Treatment of Wrought Magnesium Sheet & Forgings  

Magnesium skin corrosion usually occurs around edges  of skin panels, underneath washers, or in areas physically  damaged by shearing, drilling, abrasion, or impact. If  the skin section can be removed easily, do so to assure  complete inhibition and treatment. If insulating washers  are involved, loosen screws sufficiently to permit brush  treatment of the magnesium under the insulating washer.  Complete mechanical removal of corrosion products is to  be practiced insofar as practicable. Limit such mechanical  cleaning to the use of stiff, hog bristle brushes and similar  nonmetallic cleaning tools (including nonwoven abrasive  pads), particularly if treatment is to be performed under field  conditions. Like aluminum, under no circumstances are steel  or aluminum tools; steel, bronze, or aluminum wool; or other  cleaning abrasive pads used on different metal surfaces to  be used in cleaning magnesium. Any entrapment of particles  from steel wire brushes or steel tools, or contamination of  treated surfaces by dirty abrasives, can cause more trouble  than the initial corrosive attack.  

Corroded magnesium may generally be treated as follows:  

1.	 Clean and strip the paint from the area to be treated.  Paint stripping procedures were discussed earlier in  this chapter and are also addressed in FAA AC 43.13-1,  Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices— Aircraft Inspection and Repair. 2.	 Use a stiff, hog-bristle brush or nonwoven abrasive  pad to break loose and remove as much of the  corrosion products as practicable. Steel wire brushes,  carborundum abrasives, or steel cutting tools must not  be used. 3.	 Treat the corroded area liberally with a chromic acid  solution that sulfuric acid has been added to. Work  the solution into pits and crevices by brushing the  area while still wet with chromic acid, again using a  nonmetallic brush. 4.	 Allow the chromic acid to remain in place for 5 to  20 minutes before wiping up the excess with a clean,  damp cloth. Do not allow the excess solution to dry  and remain on the surface, as paint lifting is caused  by such deposits. 5.	 As soon as the surfaces are dry, restore the original  protective paint.  

# Treatment of Installed Magnesium Castings  

Magnesium castings, in general, are more porous and prone  to penetrating attack than wrought magnesium skins. For  all practical purposes, however, treatment is the same for  all magnesium areas. Engine cases, bellcranks, fittings,  numerous covers, plates, and handles are the most common  magnesium castings.  

When attack occurs on a casting, the earliest practicable  treatment is required if dangerous corrosive penetration is  to be avoided. In fact, engine cases submerged in saltwater  overnight can be completely penetrated. If it is at all  practicable, separate parting surfaces to effectively treat the  existing attack and prevent its further progress. The same  general treatment sequence in the preceding paragraph for  magnesium skin is to be followed.  

If extensive removal of corrosion products from a structural  casting is involved, a decision from the manufacturer may  be necessary to evaluate the adequacy of structural strength  remaining. Specific structural repair manuals usually include  dimensional tolerance limits for critical structural members  and must be referred to if any question of safety is involved.  

# Treatment of Titanium & Titanium Alloys  

Attack on titanium surfaces is generally difficult to detect.  Titanium is, by nature, highly corrosion resistant, but it may  show deterioration from the presence of salt deposits and metal  impurities, particularly at high temperatures. Therefore, the  use of steel wool, iron scrapers, or steel brushes for cleaning or  for the removal of corrosion from titanium parts is prohibited.  

If titanium surfaces require cleaning, hand polishing with  aluminum polish or a mild abrasive is permissible if fiber  

![](images/8ce1f988c14120aa4c63286532cf7674f126e230e8b5032df9b37b9f052e8f03.jpg)  
Figure 8-29.   Magnesium corrosion.  

brushes only are used and if the surface is treated following  cleaning with a suitable solution of sodium dichromate. Wipe  the treated surface with dry cloths to remove excess solution,  but do not use a water rinse.  

# Protection of Dissimilar Metal Contacts  

Certain metals are subject to corrosion when placed in contact  with other metals. This is commonly referred to as electrolytic  or dissimilar metals corrosion. Contact of different bare  metals creates an electrolytic action when moisture is  present. If this moisture is salt water, the electrolytic action  is accelerated. The result of dissimilar metal contact is  oxidation (decomposition) of one or both metals. The chart  shown in  Figure 8-30  lists the metal combinations requiring  a protective separator. The separating materials may be  metal primer, aluminum tape, washers, grease, or sealant,  depending on the metals involved.  

# Contacts Not Involving Magnesium  

All dissimilar joints not involving magnesium are protected  by the application of a minimum of two coats of zinc  chromate or, preferably, epoxy primer in addition to normal  primer requirements. Primer is applied by brush or spray and  allowed to air dry 6 hours between coats.  

# Contacts Involving Magnesium  

To prevent corrosion between dissimilar metal joints in which  magnesium alloy is involved, each surface is insulated as  follows:  

At least two coats of zinc chromate or, preferably, epoxy  primer are applied to each surface. Next, a layer of pressure  sensitive vinyl tape   $0.003"$   thick is applied smoothly and  firmly enough to prevent air bubbles and wrinkles. To avoid  creep back, the tape is not stretched during application.  When the thickness of the tape interferes with the assembly  of parts, where relative motion exists between parts or when  service temperatures above  $250~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   are anticipated, the use  of tape is eliminated and extra coats (minimum of three) of  primer are applied.  

# Corrosion Limits  

Corrosion, however slight, is damage. Therefore, corrosion  damage is classified under the four standard types, as is any  other damage. These types are negligible damage, damage  repairable by patching, damage repairable by insertion, and  damage necessitating replacement of parts.  

The term “negligible” does not imply that little or nothing is  to be done. The corroded surface must be cleaned, treated,  and painted as appropriate. Negligible damage, generally, is  corrosion that has scarred or eaten away the surface protective  coats and begun to etch the metal. Corrosion damage  extending to classifications of “repairable by patching” and  “repairable by insertion” must be repaired in accordance  with the applicable structural repair manual. When corrosion  damage exceeds the damage limits to the extent that repair is  not possible, the component or structure must be replaced.  

# Processes & Materials Used in Corrosion  Control  

# Metal Finishing  

Aircraft parts are almost always given some type of surface  finish by the manufacturer. The main purpose is to provide  corrosion resistance; however, surface finishes may also be  applied to increase wear resistance or to provide a suitable  base for paint.  

In most instances, the original finishes described in the  following paragraphs cannot be restored in the field due  to unavailable equipment or other limitations. However,  an understanding of the various types of metal finishes is  necessary if they are to be properly maintained in the field  and if the partial restoration techniques used in corrosion  control are to be effective.  

# Surface Preparation  

Original surface treatments for steel parts usually include  a cleaning treatment to remove all traces of dirt, oil,  grease, oxides, and moisture. This is necessary to provide  an effective bond between the metal surface and the final  finish. The cleaning process may be either mechanical or  chemical. In mechanical cleaning, the following methods are  employed: wire brush, steel wool, emery cloth, sandblasting,  or vapor blasting.  

Chemical cleaning is preferred over mechanical since none  of the base metal is removed by cleaning. There are various  chemical processes now in use, and the type used depends  on the material being cleaned and the type of foreign matter  being removed.  

Steel parts are pickled to remove scale, rust, or other foreign  matter, particularly before plating. The pickling solution can  be either muriatic (hydrochloric) or sulfuric acid. Cost wise,  sulfuric acid is preferable, but muriatic acid is more effective  in removing certain types of scale. The pickling solution is  kept in a stoneware tank and is usually heated by means  of a steam coil. Parts not to be electroplated after pickling  are immersed in a lime bath to neutralize the acid from the  pickling solution.  

Electrocleaning is another type of chemical cleaning used to  remove grease, oil, or organic matter. In this cleaning process,  the metal is suspended in a hot alkaline solution containing  special wetting agents, inhibitors, and materials to provide  the necessary electrical conductivity. An electric current is  then passed through the solution in a manner similar to that  used in electroplating.  

![](images/4e7e1f9fa7658da58c1ecaad4743950ae6146f265c594324327f5f1d33110117.jpg)  
Figure 8-30.   Dissimilar metal contacts that will result in electrolytic corrosion.  

# Alodizing  

Aluminum and magnesium parts are also cleaned by using  some of the foregoing methods. Blast cleaning, using abrasive  media, is not applicable to thin aluminum sheets, particularly  Alclad. Steel grits are not used on aluminum or corrosion  resistant metals.  

Polishing, buffing, and coloring of metal surfaces play a very  important part in the finishing of metal surfaces. Polishing  and buffing operations are sometimes used when preparing  a metal surface for electroplating, and all three operations  are used when the metal surface requires a high luster finish.  

# Chemical Treatments  

# Anodizing  

Anodizing is the most common surface treatment of  nonclad aluminum alloy surfaces. It is typically done in  specialized facilities in accordance with MIL-DTL-5541F or  AMS‑C‑5541A. The aluminum alloy sheet or casting is the  positive pole in an electrolytic bath in which chromic acid or  other oxidizing agent produces an aluminum oxide film on  the metal surface. Aluminum oxide is naturally protective.  Anodizing merely increases the thickness and density of the  natural oxide film. When this coating is damaged in service, it  can only be partially restored by chemical surface treatments.  Therefore, when an anodized surface is cleaned including  corrosion removal, the technician must avoid unnecessary  destruction of the oxide film. The anodized coating provides  excellent resistance to corrosion. The coating is soft and  easily scratched, making it necessary to use extreme caution  when handling it prior to coating it with primer.  

Aluminum wool, nylon webbing impregnated with aluminum  oxide abrasive, fine grade, nonwoven abrasive pads, or fiber  bristle brushes are the approved tools for cleaning anodized  surfaces. The use of steel wool, steel wire brushes, or harsh  abrasive materials on any aluminum surface is prohibited.  Producing a buffed or wire brush finish by any means is also  prohibited. Otherwise, anodized surfaces are treated in much  the same manner as other aluminum finishes.  

In addition to its corrosion resistant qualities, the anodic  coating is also an excellent bond for paint. In most cases, parts  are primed and painted as soon as possible after anodizing.  The anodic coating is a poor conductor of electricity;  therefore, if parts require bonding, the coating is removed  where the bonding wire is to be attached. Alclad surfaces that  are to be left unpainted require no anodic treatment; however,  if the Alclad surface is to be painted, it is usually anodized  to provide a bond for the paint.  

Alodizing is a simple chemical treatment for all aluminum  alloys to increase their corrosion resistance and to improve  their paint bonding qualities. Because of its simplicity, it is  rapidly replacing anodizing in aircraft work.  

The process consists of precleaning with an acidic or alkaline  metal cleaner that is applied by either dipping or spraying.  The parts are then rinsed with fresh water under pressure  for 10 to 15 seconds. After thorough rinsing, Bonderite ®  is  applied by dipping, spraying, or brushing. A thin, hard coating  results, ranging in color from light, bluish green with a slight  iridescence on copper free alloys to an olive green on copper  bearing alloys. The Bonderite ®  is first rinsed with clear, cold  or warm water for a period of 15 to 30 seconds. An additional  10 to 15 second rinse is then given in a Deoxylyte ®  bath.  This bath is to counteract alkaline material and to make the  Bonderite ®  aluminum surface slightly acid on drying.  

# Chemical Surface Treatment and Inhibitors  

As previously described, aluminum and magnesium alloys  in particular are protected originally by a variety of surface  treatments. Steels may have been treated on the surface  during manufacture. Most of these coatings can only be  restored by processes that are completely impractical in the  field. However, corroded areas where such protective films  have been destroyed require some type of treatment prior  to refinishing.  

The labels on the containers of surface treatment chemicals  provide warnings if a material is toxic or flammable. However,  the label might not be large enough to accommodate a list of  all the possible hazards that may ensue if the materials are  mixed with incompatible substances. The Safety Data Sheet  (SDS) should also be consulted for information. For example,  some chemicals used in surface treatments react violently if  inadvertently mixed with paint thinners. Chemical surface  treatment materials must be handled with extreme care and  mixed exactly according to directions.  

# Chromic Acid Inhibitor  

A 10 percent solution by weight of chromic acid, activated  by a small amount of sulfuric acid, is particularly effective in  treating exposed or corroded aluminum surfaces. It may also  be used to treat corroded magnesium. This treatment tends  to restore the protective oxide coating on the metal surface.  Such treatment must be followed by regular paint finishes as  soon as practicable and never later than the same day as the  latest chromic acid treatment. Chromium trioxide flake is a  powerful oxidizing agent and a fairly strong acid. It must be  stored away from organic solvents and other combustibles.  Either thoroughly rinse or dispose of wiping cloths used in  chromic acid pickup.  

# Sodium Dichromate Solution  

A less active chemical mixture for surface treatment of  aluminum is a solution of sodium dichromate and chromic  acid. Entrapped solutions of this mixture are less likely to  corrode metal surfaces than chromic acid inhibitor solutions.  

# Chemical Surface Treatments  

Several commercial, activated chromate acid mixtures are  available under Specification MIL-C-5541 for field treatment  of damaged or corroded aluminum surfaces. Take precautions  to make sure that sponges or cloths used are thoroughly rinsed  to avoid a possible fire hazard after drying.  

# Protective Paint Finishes  

A good, intact paint finish is the most effective barrier between  metal surfaces and corrosive media.  [Figure 8-31]  The most  common finishes include catalyzed polyurethane enamel,  waterborne polyurethane enamel, and two-part epoxy  paint. As new regulations regarding the emission of volatile  organic compounds (VOCs) are put into effect, the use of  waterborne paint systems have increased in popularity.  Also, still available are nitrate and butyrate dope finishes  for fabric-covered aircraft. In addition, high visibility  fluorescent materials may also be used, along with a variety  of miscellaneous combinations of special materials. There  may also be rain erosion resistant coatings on metal leading  edges and several different baked enamel finishes on engine  cases and wheels.  

# Aircraft Cleaning  

Cleaning an aircraft and keeping it clean are extremely  important. From an AMT's viewpoint, it should be considered  a regular part of aircraft maintenance. Keeping the aircraft  clean can mean more accurate inspection results, and may  even allow a flight crewmember to spot an impending  component failure. A cracked landing gear fitting covered  with mud and grease may be easily overlooked. Dirt can  hide cracks in the skin. Dust and grit cause hinge fittings to  wear excessively. If left on the aircraft’s outer surface, a film  of dirt reduces flying speed and adds extra weight. Dirt or  trash blowing or bouncing around the inside of the aircraft is  annoying and dangerous. Small pieces of dirt blown into the  eyes of the pilot at a critical moment can cause an accident. A  coating of dirt and grease on moving parts makes a grinding  compound that can cause excessive wear. Salt water has a  serious corroding effect on exposed metal parts of the aircraft  and must be washed off immediately.  

There are many kinds of cleaning agents approved for use in  cleaning aircraft. It is impractical to cover each of the various  types of cleaning agents since their use varies under different  conditions, such as the type of material to be removed, the  aircraft finish, and whether the cleaning is internal or external.  

In general, the types of cleaning agents used on aircraft are  solvents, emulsion cleaners, soaps, and synthetic detergents.  Their use must be in accordance with the applicable  maintenance manual. The types of cleaning agents named  above are also classed as light- or heavy-duty cleaners.  The soap and synthetic detergent-type cleaners are used for  light-duty cleaning, while the solvent and emulsion-type  cleaners are used for heavy-duty cleaning. The light-duty  cleaners that are nontoxic and nonflammable must be used  whenever possible. As mentioned previously, cleaners that  can be effectively rinsed and neutralized must be used, or an  alkaline cleaner may cause corrosion within the lap joints of  riveted or spot-welded sheet metal components.  

# Exterior Cleaning  

There are three methods of cleaning the aircraft exterior:  wet wash, dry wash, and polishing. Polishing can be further  broken down into hand polishing and mechanical polishing.  

![](images/857cdb4503fe1542b868c0a1cbfa9d1650a416008521bc237b3b89389a2a4cf0.jpg)  
Figure 8-31.   Protective paint finishes are the most effective means of preventing corrosion.  

The type and extent of soiling and the final desired appearance  determine the cleaning method to be used.  

Wet wash removes oil, grease, carbon deposits, and most  soils, with the exception of corrosion and oxide films. The  cleaning compounds used are generally applied by spray or  mop. Then high-pressure running water is used as a rinse.  Either alkaline or emulsion cleaners can be used in the wet  wash method.  

Dry wash is used to remove airport film, dust, and small  accumulations of dirt and soil when the use of liquids is  neither desirable nor practical. This method is not suitable for  removing heavy deposits of carbon, grease, or oil, especially  in the engine exhaust areas. Dry wash materials are applied  with spray, mops, or cloths and removed by dry mopping or  wiping with clean, dry cloths.  

Polishing restores the luster to painted and unpainted surfaces  of the aircraft and is usually performed after the surfaces have  been cleaned. Polishing is also used to remove oxidation and  corrosion. Polishing materials are available in various forms  and degrees of abrasiveness. It is important that the aircraft  manufacturer’s instructions be used in specific applications.  

The washing of aircraft should be performed in the shade  whenever possible, as cleaning compounds tend to streak  the surface if applied to hot metal or are permitted to dry  on the area. Install covers over all openings where water  or cleaners might enter and cause damage. Pay particular  attention to instrument system components, such as pitot- static fittings and ports.  

Various areas of aircraft, such as the sections housing radar  and the area forward of the flight deck that are finished with  a flat-finish paint, must not be cleaned more than necessary  and never scrubbed with stiff brushes or coarse rags. A soft  sponge or cheesecloth with a minimum of manual rubbing  is advisable. Any oil or exhaust stains on the surface must  first be removed with a solvent, such as kerosene or other  petroleum-based solvent. Rinse the surfaces immediately after  cleaning to prevent the compound from drying on the surface.  

Before applying soap and water to plastic surfaces, flush the  plastic surfaces with fresh water to dissolve salt deposits and  wash away dust particles. Plastic surfaces are to be washed  with soap and water, preferably by hand.  

Rinse with fresh water and dry with a chamois, synthetic wipes  designed for use on plastic windshields, or absorbent cotton.  In view of the soft surface, do not rub plastic with a dry cloth  since this is not only likely to cause scratches, but it also builds  up an electrostatic charge that attracts dust particles to the  surface. The charge, as well as the dust, may be removed by  patting or gently blotting with a clean, damp chamois. Do not  use scouring powder or other material that can mar the plastic  surface. Remove oil and grease by rubbing gently with a cloth  wet with soap and water. Do not use acetone, benzene, carbon  tetrachloride, lacquer thinners, window cleaning sprays,  gasoline, fire extinguisher, or deicer fluid on plastics, because  they soften the plastic and cause crazing. Finish cleaning the  plastic by coating with a plastic polish intended for aircraft  windows and windshields. These polishes can minimize  small surface scratches and also help keep static charges from  building up on the surface of the windows.  

Surface oil, hydraulic fluid, grease, or fuel can be removed  from aircraft tires by washing with a mild soap solution. After  cleaning, lubricate all grease fittings, hinges, and so forth,  where removal, contamination, or dilution of the grease is  suspected during washing of the aircraft.  

# Interior Cleaning  

Keeping the interior of the aircraft clean is just as important as  maintaining a clean exterior surface. Corrosion can establish  itself on the inside structure to a greater degree, because it is  difficult to reach some areas for cleaning. Nuts, bolts, bits of  wire, or other metal objects carelessly dropped and neglected,  combined with moisture and dissimilar metal contact, can  cause electrolytic corrosion.  

When performing structural work inside the aircraft, clean  up all metal particles and other debris as soon as possible.  To make cleaning easier and prevent the metal particles and  debris from getting into inaccessible areas, use a drop cloth  in the work area to catch this debris. A vacuum cleaner can  be used to pick up dust and dirt from the interior of the flight  deck and cabin.  

Aircraft interior present certain problems during cleaning  operations due to the fact that aircraft cabin compartments  are relatively small enclosures. The possibility of restricted  ventilation and quick buildup of flammable vapor/air  mixtures can occur when there is any indiscriminate use of  flammable cleaning agents or solvents. Additionally, there  may also exist the possibility of an ignition source from  concurrent maintenance work in the form of an electrical  fault, friction or static spark, an open flame device, etc.  

Wherever possible, use nonflammable agents in these operations  to reduce to the minimum the fire and explosion hazards.  

# Types of Cleaning Operations  

The principal areas of aircraft cabins that may need periodic  cleaning are:  

1.	 Aircraft passenger cabin areas (seats, carpets, side  

panels, headliners, overhead racks, curtains, ash trays,  windows, doors, decorative panels of plastic, wood,  

or similar materials)

 2.	 Aircraft flight station areas (similar materials to those  found in passenger cabin areas plus instrument panels,  control pedestals, glare shields, flooring materials,  metallic surfaces of instruments and flight control  equipment, electrical cables and contacts, and so forth)

 3.	 Lavatories and buffets (similar materials to those  found in passenger cabin areas plus toilet facilities,  metal fixtures and trim, trash containers, cabinets,  wash and sink basins, mirrors, ovens, and so forth)  

# Nonflammable Aircraft Cabin Cleaning Agents &  Solvents  

1.	 Detergents and soaps—These have widespread  application for most aircraft cleaning operations  involving fabrics, headliners, rugs, windows, and  similar surfaces that are not damageable by water  solutions since they are colorfast and nonshrinkable.  Care is frequently needed to prevent leaching of water- soluble fire retardant salts that may have been used  to treat such materials in order to reduce their flame  spread characteristics. Allowing water laced with fire  retardant salts to come in contact with the aluminum  framework of seats and seat rails can induce corrosion.  Be careful to ensure only the necessary amount of  water is applied to the seat materials when cleaning.

 2.	 Alkaline cleaners—Most of these agents are water- soluble and thus have no fire hazard properties. They  can be used on fabrics, headliners, rugs, and similar  surfaces in the same manner as detergent and soap  solutions with only minor added limitations resulting  from their inherent caustic character. This may  increase their efficiency as cleaning agents, but results  in somewhat greater deteriorating effects on certain  fabrics and plastics.

 3.	 Acid solutions—A number of proprietary acid  solutions are available for use as cleaning agents.  They are normally mild solutions designed primarily  to remove carbon smut or corrosive stains. As water- based solutions, they have no flash point, but may  require more careful and judicious use to prevent  damage to fabrics, plastics, or other surfaces and  protect the skin and clothing of those using the  materials.

 4.	 Deodorizing or disinfecting agents—A number of  proprietary agents useful for aircraft cabin deodorizing  or disinfecting are nonflammable. Most of these are  designed for spray application (aerosol type) and have  

a nonflammable pressurizing agent, but it is best to  check this carefully as some may contain a flammable  compressed gas for pressurization. 5.	 Abrasives—Some proprietary nonflammable mild  abrasive materials are available for rejuvenating  painted or polished surfaces. They present no fire  hazard. 6.	 Dry cleaning agents—Perch lor ethylene and  trich lor ethylene as used at ambient temperatures are  examples of nonflammable dry cleaning agents. These  materials do have a toxicity hazard requiring care in  their use, and in some locations due to environmental  laws, their use may be prohibited or severely  restricted. In the same way, water-soluble agents can  be detrimental. Fire retardant treated materials may  be adversely affected by the application of these dry  cleaning agents.  

# Flammable & Combustible Agents  

1.	 High flash point solvents—Specially refined petroleum  products, first developed as “Stoddard solvent” and  now sold under a variety of trade names by different  companies, have solvent properties approximating  gasoline, but have fire hazard properties similar to  those of kerosene as commonly used (not heated).  Most of these are stable products having a flash point  from  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $140\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   with a comparatively low degree  of toxicity. 2.	 Low flash point solvents—Class I (flash point at  below  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) flammable liquids are not to be used for  aircraft cleaning or refurbishing. Common materials  falling into this “class” are acetone, aviation gasoline  (AVGAS), methyl ethyl ketone, naphtha, and toluol.  In cases where it is absolutely necessary to use a  flammable liquid, use high flash point liquids (those  having a flash point of   $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or more). 3.	 Mixed liquids—Some commercial solvents are  mixtures of liquids with differing rates of evaporation,  such as a mixture of one of the various naphthas and a  chlorinated material. The different rates of evaporation  may present problems from both the toxicity and fire  hazard viewpoints. Such mixtures must not be used,  unless they are stored and handled with full knowledge  of these hazards and appropriate precautions taken.  

# Container Controls  

Flammable liquids should be handled only in approved  containers or safety cans appropriately labeled.  

# Fire Prevention Precautions  

During aircraft cleaning or refurbishing operations where  flammable or combustible liquids are used, the following  general safeguards are recommended:  

1.	 Aircraft cabins are to be provided with ventilation  sufficient at all times to prevent the accumulation of  flammable vapors. To accomplish this, doors to cabins  shall be open to secure maximum advantage of natural  ventilation. Where such natural ventilation is not  sufficient, approved mechanical ventilation equipment  shall be provided and used. The accumulation of  flammable vapors above 25 percent of the lower  flammability limit of the particular vapor being used,  measured at a point 5 feet from the location of use,  shall result in emergency revisions of operations in  progress. 2.	 All open flame and spark producing equipment or  devices that may be brought within the vapor hazard  area must be shut down and not operated during the  period when flammable vapors may exist. 3.	 Electrical equipment of a hand portable nature, used  within an aircraft cabin, shall be of the type approved  for use in Class I, Group D, Hazardous Locations as  defined by the National Electrical Code. 4.	 Switches to aircraft cabin lighting and to the aircraft  electrical system components within the cabin area  must not be worked on or switched on or off during  cleaning operations. 5.	 Suitable warning signs must be placed in conspicuous  locations at aircraft doors to indicate that flammable  liquids are being or have been used in the cleaning or  refurbishing operation in progress.  

# Fire Protection Recommendations  

During aircraft cleaning or refurbishing operations where  flammable liquids are used, the following general fire  protection safeguards are recommended:  

1.	 Aircraft undergoing such cleaning or refurbishing  must preferably be located outside of the hangar  buildings when weather conditions permit. This  provides for added natural ventilation and normally  assures easier access to the aircraft in the event of fire. 2.	 It is recommended that during such cleaning or  refurbishing operations in an aircraft outside of the  hangar that portable fire extinguishers be provided  at cabin entrances having a minimum rating of 20-B.  Additionally, at minimum, a booster hose line with an  adjustable water spray nozzle capable of reaching the  cabin area for use pending the arrival of airport fire  equipment must be available. As an alternate to the  previous recommendations, a Class A fire extinguisher  having a minimum rating of 4-A plus or a Class B fire  extinguisher having a minimum rating of 20-B must  

be placed at aircraft cabin doors for immediate use if  required. 	 NOTE 1: All-purpose ABC (dry chemical) type  extinguishers are not to be used in situations where  aluminum corrosion is a problem, if the extinguisher  is used. 	 NOTE 2: Portable and semi-portable fire detection and  extinguishing equipment has been developed, tested,  and installed to provide protection to aircraft during  construction and maintenance operations. Operators  are urged to investigate the feasibility of utilizing  such equipment during aircraft cabin cleaning and  refurbishing operations. 3.	 Aircraft undergoing such cleaning or refurbishing  where the work is to be done under cover must be  in hangars equipped with automatic fire protection  equipment.  

# Powerplant Cleaning  

Cleaning the powerplant is an important job and must be done  thoroughly. Grease and dirt accumulations on an air-cooled  engine provide an effective insulation against the cooling  effect of air flowing over it. Such an accumulation can also  cover up cracks or other defects.  

When cleaning an engine, open or remove the cowling as  much as possible. Beginning with the top, wash down the  engine and accessories with a fine spray of kerosene or  solvent. A bristle brush may be used to help clean some of  the surfaces.  

Fresh water, soap, and approved cleaning solvents may be used  for cleaning propeller and rotor blades. Except in the process  of etching, caustic material must not be used on a propeller.  Scrapers, power buffers, steel brushes, or any tool or substances  that mar or scratch the surface must not be used on propeller  blades, except as recommended for etching and repair. Water spray, rain, or other airborne abrasive material strikes  a whirling propeller blade with such force that small pits are  formed in the blade’s leading edge. If preventive measures are  not taken, corrosion causes these pits to rapidly grow larger.  The pits may become so large that it is necessary to file the  blade’s leading edge until it is smooth.  

Steel propeller blades have more resistance to abrasion and  corrosion than aluminum alloy blades. Steel blades, if rubbed  down with oil after each flight, retain a smooth surface for  a long time.  

Examine the propellers regularly, because cracks in steel or  aluminum alloy blades can become filled with oil that tends to  oxidize. This can readily be seen when the blade is inspected.  

Keeping the surface wiped with oil serves as a safety feature  by helping to make cracks more obvious.  

Propeller hubs must be inspected regularly for cracks and  other defects. Unless the hubs are kept clean, defects may not  be found. Clean steel hubs with soap and fresh water or with  an approved cleaning solvent. These cleaning solvents may  be applied by cloths or brushes. Avoid tools and abrasives  that scratch or otherwise damage the plating.  

In special cases where a high polish is desired, the use  of a good grade of metal polish is recommended. Upon  completion of the polishing, all traces of polish must be  removed immediately, the blades cleaned, and then coated  with clean engine oil. All cleaning substances must be  removed immediately after completion of the cleaning of any  propeller part. Soap in any form can be removed by rinsing  repeatedly with fresh water. After rinsing, all surfaces must  be dried and coated with clean engine oil. After cleaning the  powerplant, all control arms, bellcranks, and moving parts  must be lubricated according to instructions in the applicable  maintenance manual.  

# Solvent Cleaners  

In general, solvent cleaners used in aircraft cleaning must  have a flashpoint of not less than   $105\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$   if explosion proofing  of equipment and other special precautions are to be avoided.  Chlorinated solvents of all types meet the nonflammable  requirements, but are toxic. Safety precautions must be  observed in their use. Use of carbon tetrachloride is to be  avoided. The SDS for each solvent must be consulted for  handling and safety information.  

AMTs must review the SDS available for any chemical,  solvent, or other materials they may come in contact with  during the course of their maintenance activities. In particular,  solvents and cleaning liquids, even those considered  “environmentally friendly,” can have varied detrimental  effects on the skin, internal organs, and/or nervous system.  Active solvents, such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and  acetone, can be harmful or fatal if swallowed, inhaled, or  absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantities.  

Particular attention must be paid to recommended protective  measures including gloves, respirators, and face shields. A  regular review of the SDS keeps the AMT updated on any  revisions that may be made by chemical manufacturers or  government authorities.  

# Dry Cleaning Solvent  

Stoddard solvent is the most common petroleum base solvent  used in aircraft cleaning. Its flashpoint is slightly above   $105\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and can be used to remove grease, oils, or light soils.  

Dry cleaning solvent is preferable to kerosene for all cleaning  purposes, but like kerosene, it leaves a slight residue upon  evaporation that may interfere with the application of some  final paint films.  

# Aliphatic and Aromatic Naphtha  

Aliphatic naphtha is recommended for wipe down of cleaned  surfaces just before painting. This material can also be used  for cleaning acrylics and rubber. It flashes at approximately   $80~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and must be used with care. Aromatic naphtha must  not be confused with the aliphatic material. It is toxic,  attacks acrylics and rubber products, and must be used with  adequate controls.  

# Safety Solvent  

Safety solvent, trichloroethane (methyl chloroform), is used  for general cleaning and grease removal. It is nonflammable  under ordinary circumstances and is used as a replacement  for carbon tetrachloride. The use and safety precautions  necessary when using chlorinated solvents must be observed.  Prolonged use can cause dermatitis on some persons.  

# Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)  

MEK is also available as a solvent cleaner for metal surfaces  and paint stripper for small areas. This is a very active solvent  and metal cleaner with a flashpoint of about  $24\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   It is toxic  when inhaled, and safety precautions must be observed during  its use. In most instances, it has been replaced with safer to  handle and more environmentally-friendly cleaning solvents.  

# Kerosene  

Kerosene is mixed with solvent emulsion-type cleaners for  softening heavy preservative coatings. It is also used for  general solvent cleaning, but its use must be followed by a  coating or rinse with some other type of protective agent.  Kerosene does not evaporate as rapidly as dry cleaning  solvent and generally leaves an appreciable film on cleaned  surfaces that may actually be corrosive. Kerosene films may  be removed with safety solvent, water emulsion cleaners, or  detergent mixtures.  

# Cleaning Compound for Oxygen Systems  

Cleaning compounds for use in the oxygen system are  anhydrous (waterless) ethyl alcohol or isopropyl (anti- icing fluid) alcohol. These may be used to clean accessible  components of the oxygen system, such as crew masks and  lines. Fluids must not be put into tanks or regulators.  

Do not use any cleaning compounds that may leave an  oily film when cleaning oxygen equipment. Instructions  of the manufacturer of the oxygen equipment and cleaning  compounds must be followed at all times.  

# Emulsion Cleaners  

Solvent and water emulsion compounds are used in general  aircraft cleaning. Solvent emulsions are particularly useful in  the removal of heavy deposits, such as carbon, grease, oil, or  tar. When used in accordance with instructions, these solvent  emulsions do not affect good paint coatings or organic finishes.  

# Water Emulsion Cleaner  

Material available under Specification MIL-C-22543A is a  water emulsion cleaning compound intended for use on both  painted and unpainted aircraft surfaces. This material is also  acceptable for cleaning fluorescent painted surfaces and is  safe for use on acrylics. However, these properties vary with  the material available. A sample application must be checked  carefully before general uncontrolled use.  

# Solvent Emulsion Cleaners  

One type of solvent emulsion cleaner is nonphenolic and  can be safely used on painted surfaces without softening the  base paint. Repeated use may soften acrylic nitrocellulose  lacquers. It is effective, however, in softening and lifting  heavy preservative coatings. Persistent materials are to be  given a second or third treatment as necessary.  

Another type of solvent emulsion cleaner has a phenolic  base that is more effective for heavy-duty application, but it  also tends to soften paint coatings. It must be used with care  around rubber, plastics, or other nonmetallic materials. Wear  rubber gloves and goggles for protection when working with  phenolic base cleaners.  

# Soaps & Detergent Cleaners  

A number of materials are available for mild cleaning use. In  this section, some of the more common materials are discussed.  

# Cleaning Compound, Aircraft Surfaces  

Specification MIL-C-5410 Type I and II materials are used  in general cleaning of painted and unpainted aircraft surfaces  for the removal of light to medium soils, operational films,  oils, or greases. They are safe to use on all surfaces, including  fabrics, leather, and transparent plastics. Nonglare (flat)  finishes are not to be cleaned more than necessary and must  never be scrubbed with stiff brushes.  

# Nonionic Detergent Cleaners  

These materials may be either water-soluble or oil-soluble.  The oil-soluble detergent cleaner is effective in a 3 to 5  percent solution in dry cleaning solvent for softening and  removing heavy preservative coatings. This mixture’s  performance is similar to the emulsion cleaners mentioned  previously.  

# Mechanical Cleaning Materials  

Mechanical cleaning materials must be used with care and  in accordance with directions given, if damage to finishes  and surfaces is to be avoided.  

# Mild Abrasive Materials  

No attempt is made in this section to furnish detailed  instructions for using various materials listed. Some “do’s  and don’ts” are included as an aid in selecting materials for  specific cleaning jobs.  

The introduction of various grades of nonwoven abrasive  pads has given the AMT a clean, inexpensive material for  the removal of corrosion products and for other light abrasive  needs. The pads can be used on most metals (although the  same pad should not be used on different metals) and are  generally the first choice when the situation arises. A very  open form of this pad is also available for paint stripping  when used in conjunction with wet strippers.  

Powdered pumice can be used for cleaning corroded  aluminum surfaces. Similar mild abrasives may also be used.  

Impregnated cotton wadding material is used for removal  of exhaust gas stains and polishing corroded aluminum  surfaces. It may also be used on other metal surfaces to  produce a high reflectance.  

Aluminum metal polish is used to produce a high luster,  long lasting polish on unpainted aluminum clad surfaces. It  must not be used on anodized surfaces, because it removes  the oxide coat.  

Three grades of aluminum wool, coarse, medium, and fine are  used for general cleaning of aluminum surfaces. Impregnated  nylon webbing material is preferred over aluminum wool for  the removal of corrosion products and stubborn paint films  and for the scuffing of existing paint finishes prior to touchup.  

Lacquer rubbing compound material can be used to remove  engine exhaust residues and minor oxidation. Avoid heavy  rubbing over rivet heads or edges where protective coatings  may be worn thin.  

# Abrasive Papers  

Abrasive papers used on aircraft surfaces must not contain  sharp or needlelike abrasives that can imbed themselves in  the base metal being cleaned or in the protective coating  being maintained. The abrasives used must not corrode the  material being cleaned. Aluminum oxide paper, 300 grit or  finer, is available in several forms and is safe to use on most  surfaces. Type I, Class 2 material under Federal Specification  P-C-451 is available in   $1\%"$   and   $2"$   widths. Avoid the use  of carborundum (silicon carbide) papers, particularly on  aluminum or magnesium. The grain structure of carborundum  is sharp and the material is so hard that individual grains  penetrate and bury themselves, even in steel surfaces. The use  of emery paper or crocus cloth on aluminum or magnesium can  cause serious corrosion of the metal by imbedded iron oxide.  

# Chemical Cleaners  

Chemical cleaners must be used with great care in cleaning  assembled aircraft. The danger of entrapping corrosive  materials in faying surfaces and crevices counteracts any  advantages in their speed and effectiveness. Any materials  used must be relatively neutral and easy to remove. It is  emphasized that all residues must be removed. Soluble salts  from chemical surface treatments, such as chromic acid or  dichromate treatment, liquefy and promote blistering in the  paint coatings.  

# Phosphoric-citric Acid  

A phosphoric-citric acid mixture (Type I) for cleaning  aluminum surfaces is available and is ready to use as  packaged. Type II is a concentrate that must be diluted with  mineral spirits and water. Wear rubber gloves and goggles  to avoid skin contact. Any acid burns may be neutralized by  copious water washing, followed by treatment with a diluted  solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).  

# Baking Soda  

Baking soda may be used to neutralize acid deposits in  lead-acid battery compartments and to treat acid burns from  chemical cleaners and inhibitors.  

# Chapter 9 Fluid Lines & Fittings  

# Introduction  

Aircraft fluid lines are usually made of metal tubing or  flexible hose. Metal tubing (also called rigid fluid lines) is  used in stationary applications and where long, relatively  straight runs are possible. They are widely used in aircraft  for fuel, oil, coolant, oxygen, instrument, and hydraulic lines.  Flexible hose is generally used with moving parts or where  the hose is subject to considerable vibration.  

Occasionally, it may be necessary to repair or replace  damaged aircraft fluid lines. Very often the repair can be made  simply by replacing the tubing. However, if replacements are  not available, the needed parts may have to be fabricated.  Replacement tubing should be of the same size and material  as the original tubing. All tubing is pressure tested prior to  initial installation and is designed to withstand several times  the normal operating pressure to which it is subjected. If a  tube bursts or cracks, it is generally the result of excessive  vibration, improper installation, or damage caused by  collision with an object. All tubing failures should be  carefully studied and the cause of the failure determined.  

# Rigid Fluid Lines  

# Tubing Materials  

# Copper  

In the early days of aviation, copper tubing was used  extensively in aviation fluid applications. In modern aircraft,  aluminum alloy, corrosion-resistant steel, or titanium tubing  have generally replaced copper tubing.  

# Aluminum Alloy Tubing  

Tubing made from  $1100\,\mathrm{H}14$   (  $\%$  -hard) or 3003 H14 (  $\%$  -hard)  is used for general purpose lines of low or negligible fluid  pressures, such as instrument lines and ventilating conduits.  Tubing made from 2024-T3, 5052-O, and 6061-T6 aluminum  alloy materials is used in general purpose systems of low and  medium pressures, such as hydraulic and pneumatic 1,000  to 1,500 psi systems, and fuel and oil lines.  

# Steel  

Corrosion-resistant steel tubing, either annealed CRES 304,  CRES 321, or CRES   $304{\cdot}\mathrm{1}\%$  -hard, is used extensively in  high-pressure hydraulic systems (3,000 psi or more) for the  operation of landing gear, flaps, brakes, and in fire zones. Its  higher tensile strength permits the use of tubing with thinner  walls; consequently, the final installation weight is not much  greater than that of the thicker wall aluminum alloy tubing.  Steel lines are used where there is a risk of foreign object  damage (FOD) (i.e., the landing gear and wheel well areas).  Swaged or MS flareless fittings are used with corrosion- resistant tubing. Although identification markings for steel  tubing differ, each usually includes the manufacturer’s name  or trademark, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)  number, and the physical condition of the metal.  

# Titanium 3AL–2.5V  

Titanium 3AL–2.5V tubing and fitting is used extensively in  transport category and high-performance aircraft hydraulic  systems for pressures above 1,500 psi. Titanium is 30 percent  stronger than steel and 50 percent lighter than steel. Cryofit  fittings or swaged fittings are used with titanium tubing.  Do not use titanium tubing and fittings in any oxygen  system assembly. Titanium and titanium alloys are oxygen  reactive. If a freshly formed titanium surface is exposed in  gaseous oxygen, spontaneous combustion could occur at  low pressures.  

# Material Identification  

Before making repairs to any aircraft tubing, it is important to  make accurate identification of tubing materials. Aluminum  alloy, steel, or titanium tubing can be identified readily by  sight where it is used as the basic tubing material. However,  it is difficult to determine whether a material is carbon  steel or stainless steel, or whether it is 1100, 3003, 5052-O,  6061-T6, or 2024-T3 aluminum alloy. To positively identify  the material used in the original installation, compare  code markings of the replacement tubing with the original  markings on the tubing being replaced.  

On large aluminum alloy tubing, the alloy designation is  stamped on the surface. On small aluminum tubing, the  designation may be stamped on the surface; but more often it  is shown by a color code, not more than 4" in width, painted  at the two ends and approximately midway between the ends  of some tubing. When the band consists of two colors, one- half the width is used for each color.  [Figure 9-1]  

If the code markings are hard or impossible to read, it may  be necessary to test samples of the material for hardness by  hardness testing.  

# Sizes  

Metal tubing is sized by outside diameter (OD), which is  measured fractionally in sixteenths of an inch. For example,  number 6 tubing is  $\%"$   (or  $\%"$  ) and number 8 tubing is  $\%"$  (or   $\%"$  ) and so forth. The tube diameter is printed on all  rigid tubing. In addition to other classifications or means  of identification, tubing is manufactured in various wall  thicknesses. Thus, it is important when installing tubing to  know not only the material and outside diameter, but also  the thickness of the wall. The wall thickness is printed on  the tubing in thousandths of an inch. To determine the inside  diameter (ID) of the tube, subtract twice the wall thickness  from the outside diameter. For example, a number 10 piece of  tubing with a wall thickness of  $0.063"$   has an inside diameter  of   $0.625"-2(0.063")=0.499"$  .  

# Fabrication of Metal Tube Lines  

Damaged tubing and fluid lines should be repaired with  new parts whenever possible. Unfortunately, sometimes  replacement is impractical and repair is necessary. Scratches,  abrasions, or minor corrosion on the outside of fluid lines  may be considered negligible and can be smoothed out with  a burnishing tool or aluminum wool. Limitations on the  amount of damage that can be repaired in this manner are  discussed in this chapter under “Rigid Tubing Inspection  and Repair.” If a fluid line assembly is to be replaced, the  fittings can often be salvaged; then the repair involves only  tube forming and replacement.  

Tube forming consists of four processes: cutting, bending,  flaring, and beading. If the tubing is small and made of soft  material, the assembly can be formed by hand bending during  installation. If the tube is  $\%"$   diameter or larger, hand bending  without the aid of tools is impractical.  

# Tube Cutting  

When cutting tubing, it is important to produce a square  end, free of burrs. Tubing may be cut with a tube cutter or a  hacksaw. The cutter can be used with any soft metal tubing,  such as copper, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. Correct use of  the tube cutter is shown in  Figure 9-2.  Special chipless cutters  are available for cutting aluminum 6061-T6, corrosion- resistant steel, and titanium tubing.  

A new piece of tubing should be cut approximately 10 percent  longer than the tube to be replaced to provide for minor  variations in bending. Place the tube in the cutting tool with  the cutting wheel at the point where the cut is to be made.  Rotate the cutter around the tubing, applying light pressure to  the cutting wheel by intermittently twisting the thumbscrew.  

Too much pressure on the cutting wheel at one time could  deform the tubing or cause excessive burring. After cutting  the tubing, carefully remove any burrs from inside and outside  the tube. Use a knife or the burring edge attached to the tube  cutter. The deburring operation can be accomplished by the  use of a deburring tool.  [Figure 9-3]  This tool is capable of  removing both the inside and outside burrs by just turning  the tool end for end.  

When performing the deburring operation, use extreme care  that the wall thickness of the end of the tubing is not reduced  or fractured. Very slight damage of this type can lead to  fractured flares or defective flares, which do not seal properly.  Use a fine-tooth file to file the end square and smooth.  

If a tube cutter is not available, or if tubing of hard material  is to be cut, use a fine-tooth hacksaw, preferably one having  32 teeth per inch. The use of a saw decreases the amount of  work hardening of the tubing during the cutting operation.  After sawing, file the end of the tube square and smooth,  removing all burrs.  

An easy way to hold small diameter tubing, when cutting it, is  to place the tube in a combination flaring tool and clamp the  tool in a vise. Make the cut about one-half inch from the flaring  tool. This procedure keeps sawing vibrations to a minimum  and prevents damage to the tubing if it is accidentally hit with  the hacksaw frame or file handle while cutting. Be sure all  filings and cuttings are removed from the tube.  

# Tube Bending  

The objective in tube bending is to obtain a smooth bend  without flattening the tube. Tubing under   $\%"$   in diameter  usually can be bent without the use of a bending tool. For  larger sizes, either portable hand benders or production  benders are usually used.  Figure 9-4   shows preferred methods  and standard bend radii for bending tubing by tube size.  

![](images/8efde8e85ec7f6cbaa7cb3d14f05e87901c65f90d29af0f45594949568fb888b.jpg)  

Using a hand bender, insert the tubing into the groove of  the bender so that the measured end is left of the form  block. Align the two zeros and align the mark on the tubing  with the L on the form handle. If the measured end is on  the right side, then align the mark on the tubing with the  R on the form handle. With a steady motion, pull the form  handle until the zero mark on the form handle lines up  with the desired angle of bend, as indicated on the radius
 block.  [Figure 9-5]  

Hand benders come in different sizes that correspond to the  tube diameter. Make sure to select the correct bender for  the desired tube diameter.  Figure 9-6  shows hand benders  available for different sizes of tubing. Typically, the tubing  size is stamped in the bender.  [Figure 9-7]  

Bend the tubing carefully to avoid excessive flattening,  kinking, or wrinkling. A small amount of flattening in bends is  acceptable, but the small diameter of the flattened portion must  not be less than 75 percent of the original outside diameter.  Tubing with flattened, wrinkled, or irregular bends should  not be installed. Wrinkled bends usually result from trying to  bend thin wall tubing without using a tube bender. Excessive  flattening causes fatigue failure of the tube. Examples of  correct and incorrect tubing bends are shown in  Figure 9-8.  

Tube bending machines for all types of tubing are generally  used in repair stations and large maintenance shops.  With such equipment, proper bends can be made on large  diameter tubing and on tubing made from hard material. The  production CNC™ tube bender is an example of this type of  machine.  [Figure 9-9]  

![](images/f3b16bb3405fc1c0d649736a5104aaa0a718aa24ab4fb9430fcbf71a5a8cd2f5.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.   Tube cutting.  

The ordinary production tube bender accommodates tubing  ranging from  $\%"$   to  $1\%"$   outside diameter. Benders for larger  sizes are available, and the principle of their operation is  similar to that of the hand tube bender. The radius blocks are  so constructed that the radius of bend varies with the tube  diameter. The radius of bend is usually stamped on the block.  

# Alternative Bending Methods  

When hand or production tube benders are not available or  are not suitable for a particular bending operation, a filler of  metallic composition or of dry sand may be used to facilitate  bending. When using this method, cut the tube slightly longer  than required. The extra length is for inserting a plug (which  may be wooden) in each end. The tube can also be closed  by flattening the ends or by soldering metal disks in them.  

After plugging one end, fill and pack the tube with fine, dry  sand and plug tightly. Both plugs must be tight so they are not  forced out when the bend is made. After the ends are closed,  bend the tubing over a forming block shaped to the specified  radius. In a modified version of the filler method, a fusible  alloy is used instead of sand. In this method, the tube is filled  under hot water with a fusible alloy that melts at  $160\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The  alloy-filled tubing is then removed from the water, allowed  to cool, and bent slowly by hand around a forming block or  with a tube bender. After the bend is made, the alloy is again  melted under hot water and removed from the tubing. When  using either filler methods, make certain that all particles of  the filler are removed. Visually inspect with a borescope to  make certain that no particles are carried into the system in  which the tubing is installed. Store the fusible alloy filler  where it is free from dust or dirt. It can be re-melted and  reused as often as desired. Never heat this filler in any other  way than the prescribed method, as the alloy will stick to the  inside of the tubing, making them both unusable.  

# Tube Flaring  

Two kinds of flares are generally used in aircraft tubing: the

![A– Hand       B–Portable hand benders      C–Production bender ](images/4d23aa960afd07d88a82e655e897bca7d4fd9a27e99068f40d8b7bd93aa6fe08.jpg)  

single flare and the double flare.  [Figure 9-10A  and  $B J$    Flares  are frequently subjected to extremely high pressures; therefore,  the flare on the tubing must be properly shaped or the  connection leaks or fails. A flare made too small produces a  weak joint, which may leak or pull apart; if made too large,  it interferes with the proper engagement of the screw thread  on the fitting and causes leakage. A crooked flare is the result  of the tubing not being cut squarely. If a flare is not made  properly, flaws cannot be corrected by applying additional  torque when tightening the fitting. The flare and tubing must be  free from cracks, dents, nicks, scratches, or any other defects.  

The flaring tool used for aircraft tubing has male and female  dies ground to produce a flare of   $35^{\circ}$   to   $37^{\circ}$  . Under no  circumstance is it permissible to use an automotive-type  flaring tool that produces a flare of   $45^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 9-11]  

The single-flare hand flaring tool, similar to that shown in  Figure 9-12,  is used for flaring tubing. The tool consists of  a flaring block or grip die, a yoke, and a flaring pin. The  flaring block is a hinged double bar with holes corresponding  to various sizes of tubing. These holes are countersunk on  one end to form the outside support against which the flare is  formed. The yoke is used to center the flaring pin over the end  of the tube to be flared. Two types of flaring tools are used to  make flares on tubing: the impact type and the rolling type.  

# Instructions for Rolling-Type Flaring Tools  

Use these tools only to flare soft copper, aluminum, and brass  tubing. Do not use with corrosion-resistant steel or titanium.  

![](images/e92705d65e31a66c9f3eaa5ba17bad488401921ba7ca84c29933ef5b4b8fb249.jpg)

Figure 9-7.   Size identification.  

Cut the tube squarely and remove all burrs. Slip the fitting  nut and sleeve on the tube. Loosen clamping screw used for  locking the sliding segment in the die holder. This permits  their separation. The tools are self-gauging; the proper size  

![](images/5f96b3caffd80a7f2c6019bdad3e078f7c556ac67189d2ee0c3306afc2cbbe2f.jpg)

Figure 9-8.   Correct and incorrect tubing bends.  

flare is produced when tubing is clamped flush with the top  of the die block. Insert tubing between the segments of the  die block that correspond to the size of the tubing to be flared.  Advance the clamp screw against the end segment and tighten  firmly. Move the yoke down over the top of the die holder  and twist it clockwise to lock it into position. Turn the feed  screw down firmly, and continue until a slight resistance is  felt. This indicates an accurate flare has been completed.  Always read the tool manufacturer’s instructions, because  there are several different types of rolling-type flaring tools  that use slightly different procedures.  

# Double Flaring  

A double flare is used on soft aluminum alloy tubing   $\%"$  "  outside diameter and under. This is necessary to prevent  cutting off the flare and failure of the tube assembly under  operating pressures. A double flare is smoother and more  concentric than a single flare and therefore seals better. It is  also more resistant to the shearing effect of torque.  

# Double Flaring Instructions  

Deburr both the inside and outside of the tubing to be flared.  Cut off the end of the tubing if it appears damaged. Anneal  brass, copper, and aluminum by heating to a dull red and cool  

![](images/b2003131eab13f390a589bdf93e84d1c59c838bb14935442ec0484b0c2295dd2.jpg)

rapidly in cold water. Open the flaring tool by unscrewing  both clamping screws. Select the hole in the flaring bar that  matches the tubing diameter and place the tubing with the  end you have just prepared, extending above the top of the  bar by a distance equal to the thickness of the shoulder of  the adapter insert. Tighten clamping screws to hold tubing  securely. Insert pilot of correctly sized adapter into tubing.  Slip yoke over the flaring bars and center over adapter.  Advance the cone downward until the shoulder of the adapter  rests on the flaring bar. This bells out the end of the tubing.  Next, back off the cone just enough to remove the adapter.  After removing the adapter, advance the cone directly into the  belled end of the tubing. This folds the tubing on itself and  forms an accurate double flare without cracking or splitting  the tubing. To prevent thinning out of the flare wall, do not  overtighten.  [Figure 9-13]  

# Fittings  

Rigid tubing may be joined to either an end item (such as a  brake cylinder), another section of either rigid tubing, or to a  flexible hose (such as a drain line). In the case of connection  to an end item or another tube, fittings are required, which  may or may not necessitate flaring of the tube. In the case of  attachment to a hose, it may be necessary to bead the rigid  tube so that a clamp can be used to hold the hose onto the tube.  

# Flareless Fittings  

Although the use of flareless tube fittings eliminates all  tube flaring, another operation, referred to as presetting,  is necessary prior to installation of a new flareless tube  assembly. Flareless tube assemblies should be preset with the  proper size presetting tool or operation.  Figure 9-14  (steps  

![](images/38fa23b420b93e69088edf5ecb43aedbbe1c8091f152fb10a810a09cf1069dc2.jpg)  
Figure 9-10.   Cutaway view of single-flared (A) and double- flared (B) tube ends.  

1, 2, and 3) illustrates the presetting operation, which is  performed as follows:  

1.	 Cut the tube to the correct length, with the ends  perfectly square. Deburr the inside and outside of  the tube. Slip the nut, then the sleeve, over the tube  (step 1), lubricate the threads of the fitting and nut  with hydraulic fluid.  2.	 Place the fitting in a vise (step 2), and hold the tubing  firmly and squarely on the seat in the fitting. (The  tube must bottom firmly in the fitting.) Tighten the  nut until the cutting edge of the sleeve grips the tube.  To determine this point, slowly turn the tube back  and forth while tightening the nut. When the tube no  longer turns, the nut is ready for tightening.  

![](images/ddde036c1a5da8c4aa60b3e9b899abb7c472e80b84ca06f74a8f4022efe56008.jpg)  
Figure 9-11.   Flaring tool.  

3.	 Final tightening depends upon the tubing (step 3). For  aluminum alloy tubing up to and including  $\%"$   outside  diameter, tighten the nut from 1 to   $1\%$   turns. For steel  tubing and aluminum alloy tubing over   $\%"$   outside  diameter, tighten from   $1\%$   to   $1\%$   turns.  

After presetting the sleeve, disconnect the tubing from the  fitting and check the following points: The tube should extend   $\mathrm{\mathcal{V}_{32}"}$   to   $\%"$   beyond the sleeve pilot; otherwise, blowoff may  occur. The sleeve pilot should contact the tube or have a  maximum clearance of  $0.005"$   for aluminum alloy tubing or   $0.015"$   for steel tubing. A slight collapse of the tube at the  sleeve cut is permissible. No movement of the sleeve pilot,  except rotation, is permissible.  

![](images/f8f6d3aac934fe4e867e1a2d7f824a766e73580e7f249c0c72350c69aba8f83a.jpg)  
Figure 9-12.   Hand flaring tool.  

# Beading  

Tubing may be beaded with a hand beading tool, with  machine beading rolls, or with grip dies. The method to be  used depends on the diameter and wall thickness of the tube  and the material from which it was made.  

The hand beading tool is used with tubing having   $\%"$   to  1" outside diameter.  [Figure 9-15]  The bead is formed by  using the beader frame with the proper rollers attached. The  inside and outside of the tube is lubricated with light oil to  reduce the friction between the rollers during beading. The  sizes, marked in sixteenths of an inch on the rollers, are for  the outside diameter of the tubing that can be beaded with  the rollers.  

Separate rollers are required for the inside of each tubing size,  and care must be taken to use the correct parts when beading.  The hand beading tool works somewhat like the tube cutter in  that the roller is screwed down intermittently while rotating  the beading tool around the tubing. In addition, a small vise  (tube holder) is furnished with the kit.  

Other methods and types of beading tools and machines are  available, but the hand beading tool is used most often. As a  rule, beading machines are limited to use with large diameter  tubing, over   $1\%\"$  , unless special rollers are supplied. The  grip-die method of beading is confined to small tubing.  

# Fluid Line Identification  

Fluid lines in aircraft are often identified by markers made  up of color codes, words, and geometric symbols. These  markers identify each line’s function, content, and primary  hazard.  Figure   $9–l6$   illustrates the various color codes and  symbols used to designate the type of system and its contents.  

Fluid lines are marked, in most instances, with   $1"$   tape or  decals.  [Figure 9-17A]  On lines 4" in diameter (or larger),  lines in oily environment, hot lines, and on some cold  lines, steel tags may be used in place of tape or decals.  [Figure 9-17B]  Paint is used on lines in engine compartments  where there is the possibility of tapes, decals, or tags being  drawn into the engine induction system.  

In addition to the above-mentioned markings, certain lines  may be further identified regarding specific function within a  system (e.g., drain, vent, pressure, or return). Lines conveying  fuel may be marked FLAM  [Figure 9-17] ; lines containing  toxic materials are marked TOXIC in place of FLAM. Lines  containing physically dangerous materials, such as oxygen,  nitrogen, or Freon TM , may be marked PHDAN.  

Aircraft and engine manufacturers are responsible for the  original installation of identification markers, but the aviation  mechanic is responsible for the replacement when it becomes  necessary. Tapes and decals are generally placed on both  ends of a line and at least once in each compartment through  which lines run. In addition, identification markers are placed  immediately adjacent to each valve, regulator, filter, or other  accessories within a line. Where paint or tags are used,  location requirements are the same as for tapes and decals.  

# Fluid Line End Fittings  

Depending on the type and use, fittings have either pipe  threads or machine threads. Pipe threads are similar to those  used in ordinary plumbing and are tapered, both internal and  external. External threads are referred to as male threads and  internal threads are female threads.  

When two fittings are joined, a male into a female, the  thread taper forms a seal. Some form of pipe thread lubricant  approved for particular fluid application should be used when  joining pipe threads to prevent seizing and high-pressure  leakage. Use care when applying thread lubricant so that the  lubricant does not enter and contaminate the system. Do not  use lubricants on oxygen lines. Oxygen reacts with petroleum  products and can ignite (special lubricants are available or  oxygen systems).  

![](images/8f747bed8d7e3fe73e2fa0bd68b1223274c07f8025fc77d19b44d10ebacf4b87.jpg)

![](images/92e1365e50a33e7b8aab2b80a0ccbaa2164dba8404db9af58beaf461349d1678.jpg)  

Machine threads have no sealing capability and are similar  to those used on common nuts and bolts. This type of fitting  is used only to draw connections together or for attachment  through bulkheads. A flared tube connection, a crush washer,  or a synthetic seal is used to make the connection fluid tight.  Machine threads have no taper and do not form a fluid-tight  seal. The size of these fittings is given in dash numbers, which  equal the nominal outside diameter in sixteenths of an inch.  

# Universal Bulkhead Fittings  

When a fluid line passes through a bulkhead, and it is desired  to secure the line to the bulkhead, a bulkhead fitting should be  used. The end of the fitting that passes through the bulkhead  is longer than the other end(s), which allows a locknut to be  installed, securing the fitting to the bulkhead.  

Fittings attach one piece of tubing to another or to system  units. There are four types: (1) bead and clamp, (2) flared  fittings, (3) flareless fittings, and (4) permanent fittings  (Permaswage™, Permalite™, and Cyrofit™). The amount  of pressure that the system carries and the material used are  usually the deciding factors in selecting a connector.  

The beaded type of fitting, which requires a bead and a section  of hose and hose clamps, is used only in low- or medium- pressure systems, such as vacuum and coolant systems. The  flared, flareless, or permanent-type fittings may be used as  connectors in all systems, regardless of the pressure.  

# AN Flared Fittings  

A flared tube fitting consists of a sleeve and a nut.  [ Figure 9-18]  The nut fits over the sleeve and, when  tightened, draws the sleeve and tubing flare tightly against  a male fitting to form a seal. Tubing used with this type of  fitting must be flared before installation. The male fitting has  a cone-shaped surface with the same angle as the inside of  the flare. The sleeve supports the tube so that vibration does  not concentrate at the edge of the flare and distributes the  shearing action over a wider area for added strength. Fitting combinations composed of different alloys should  be avoided to prevent dissimilar metal corrosion. As with  all fitting combinations, ease of assembly, alignment, and  proper lubrication should be assured when tightening fittings  during installation.  

Standard AN fittings are identified by their black or blue color.  All AN steel fittings are colored black, all AN aluminum  fittings are colored blue, and aluminum bronze fittings are  cadmium plated and natural in appearance. A sampling of  AN fittings is shown in  Figure 9-19.   Figure 9-20  contains  

![](images/105ebcda6e4d8bcfc93e0ee978b9d4b1d9419aaa1bcc1d0a930ec4a87016c722.jpg)

additional information on sizes, torques, and bend radii. AN  flared fittings are different from MS flareless fittings and  they are not interchangeable. AN flared fittings are easily  recognized, because they have a cone at the end of the fitting  while the MS flareless fitting has a straight end.  [Figure 9-21]  

# MS Flareless Fittings  

MS flareless fittings are designed primarily for high-pressure  (3,000 psi) hydraulic systems that may be subjected to severe  vibration or fluctuating pressure.  [Figure 9-22]  Using this  type of fitting eliminates all tube flaring, yet provides a safe  and strong, dependable tube connection. The fitting consists  of three parts: a body, a sleeve, and a nut.  [Figure 9-23]  The  internal design of the body causes the sleeve to cut into the  outside of the tube when the body and nut are joined. The  counterbore shoulder within the body is designed with a  reverse angle of  $15^{\circ}$   for steel connectors and  $45^{\circ}$   for aluminum  fittings. This reverse angle prevents inward collapse of the  tubing when tightened and provides a partial sealing force  to be exerted against the periphery of the body counterbore.  

# Swaged Fittings  

A popular repair system for connecting and repairing  hydraulic lines on transport category aircraft is the use of  Permaswage™ fittings. Swaged fittings create a permanent  connection that is virtually maintenance free. Swaged  fittings are used to join hydraulic lines in areas where routine  disconnections are not required and are often used with  titanium and corrosion-resistant steel tubing. The fittings are  installed with portable hydraulically-powered tooling, which  is compact enough to be used in tight spaces.  [Figure 9-24] If the fittings need to be disconnected, cut the tubing with a  tube cutter. Special installation tooling is available in portable  kits. Always use the manufacturer’s instructions to install  swaged fittings. Typical Permaswage™ fittings are shown  in  Figure 9-25.  

One of the latest developments is the Permalite™ fitting.  Permalite™ is a tube fitting that is mechanically attached to  the tube by axial swaging. Permalite™ works by deforming  the fitting into the tube being joined by moving a ring, a  component of the Permalite™ fitting, axially along the fitting  length using a Permaswage™ Axial swage tool. Typical  Permalite™ fittings are shown in  Figure 9-26 .  

# Cryofit Fittings  

Many transport category aircraft use Cryofit fittings to join  hydraulic lines in areas where routine disconnections are not  required. Cryofit fittings are standard fittings with a cryogenic  sleeve. The sleeve is made of a shape memory alloy, Tinel™.  

![](images/5f2357a21ca4d90ac4de75899b95be9c58c3e30e683bd9c0108983d938143e24.jpg)  
Figure 9-16.   Identification of aircraft fluid lines.  

The sleeve is manufactured 3 percent smaller, frozen in  liquid nitrogen, and expanded to 5 percent larger than the  line. During installation, the fitting is removed from the  liquid nitrogen and inserted onto the tube. During a 10 to 15  second warming up period, the fitting contracts to its original  size (3 percent smaller), biting down on the tube, forming  a permanent seal. Cryofit fittings can only be removed by  cutting the tube at the sleeve, though this leaves enough  room to replace it with a swaged fitting without replacing  the hydraulic line. It is frequently used with titanium tubing.  The shape memory technology is also used for end fittings,  flared fittings, and flareless fittings.  [Figure 9-27]  

![](images/b71f6c1371b067f7994623891303935d753e91ec372a4b27558763510d0176b4.jpg)

# Rigid Tubing Installation and Inspection  

Before installing a line assembly in an aircraft, inspect the line  carefully. Remove dents and scratches, and be sure all nuts  and sleeves are snugly mated and securely fitted by proper  flaring of the tubing. The line assembly should be clean and  free of all foreign matter.  

# Connection & Torque  

Never apply compound to the faces of the fitting or the  flare, as it destroys the metal-to-metal contact between the  fitting and flare, a contact which is necessary to produce  the seal. Be sure that the line assembly is properly aligned  before tightening the fittings. Do not pull the installation  into place with torque on the nut. Correct and incorrect  methods of installing flared tube assemblies are illustrated in  Figure 9-28.  Proper torque values are given in  Figure 9-20 .  Remember that these torque values are for flared-type fittings  only. Always tighten fittings to the correct torque value when  installing a tube assembly. Overtightening a fitting may badly

# Size:  

The dash number following the AN number indicates the size of the tubing (or hose) for which the fitting is made in 16ths of an inch.  This size measures the outer diameter of tubing and the inner diameter of hose. Fittings that have pipe threads are coded by a dash  number, indicating the pipe size in 8ths of an inch. The material code letter, as noted above, follows the dash number.

damage or completely cut off the tube flare, or it may ruin the  sleeve or fitting nut. Failure to tighten sufficiently also may  be serious, as this condition may allow the line to blow out  of the assembly or to leak under system pressure. The use of  torque wrenches and the prescribed torque values prevents  overtightening or undertightening. If a tube fitting assembly is  tightened properly, it may be removed and retightened many  times before reflaring is necessary.  

# Flareless Tube Installation  

Tighten the nut by hand until an increase in resistance to  turning is encountered. Should it be impossible to run the nut  down with the fingers, use a wrench, but be alert for the first  signs of bottoming. It is important that the final tightening  commence at the point where the nut just begins to bottom.  Use a wrench and turn the nut one-sixth turn (one flat on a  hex nut). Use a wrench on the connector to prevent it from  turning while tightening the nut. After the tube assembly  is installed, the system should be pressure tested. It is  permissible to tighten the nut an additional one-sixth turn  (making a total of one-third turn), should a connection leak.  If leakage still occurs after tightening the nut a total of one- third turn, remove the assembly and inspect the components  for scores, cracks, presence of foreign material, or damage  from overtightening. Several aircraft manufacturers include  torque values in their maintenance manuals to tighten the  flareless fittings.

Figure 9-23.   Flareless fitting.  

The following notes, cautions, and faults apply to the  installation of rigid tubing.  

Note:  Overtightening a flareless tube nut drives the cutting  edge of the sleeve deeply into the tube, causing the tube to be  weakened to the point where normal in-flight vibration could  cause the tube to shear. After inspection (if no discrepancies  are found), reassemble the connections and repeat the  pressure test procedures.  

Caution:  Never tighten the nut beyond one-third turn (two  flats on the hex nut); this is the maximum the fitting may be  tightened without the possibility of permanently damaging  the sleeve and nut.  

Common faults: Flare distorted into nut threads; sleeve  cracked; flare cracked or split; flare out of round; inside of  flare rough or scratched; and threads of nut or union dirty,  damaged, or broken.  

# Rigid Tubing Inspection & Repair  

Minor dents and scratches in tubing may be repaired.  Scratches or nicks not deeper than 10 percent of the wall  thickness in aluminum alloy tubing, which are not in the  heel of a bend, may be repaired by burnishing with hand  tools. The damage limits for hard, thin-walled corrosion- resistant steel and titanium tubing are considerably less  than for aluminum tubing and might depend on the aircraft  manufacturer. Consult the aircraft maintenance manual for  damage limits. Replace lines with severe die marks, seams,  or splits in the tube. Any crack or deformity in a flare is  unacceptable and is cause for rejection. A dent of less than  20 percent of the tube diameter is not objectionable, unless  it is in the heel of a bend. To remove dents, draw a bullet of  proper size through the tube by means of a length of cable,  or push the bullet through a short straight tube by means of  a dowel rod. In this case, a bullet is a ball bearing or slug

normally made of steel or some other hard metal. In the case  of soft aluminum tubing, a hard wood slug or dowel may even  be used as a bullet.  [Figure 9-29]  A severely damaged line  should be replaced. However, the line may be repaired by  cutting out the damaged section and inserting a tube section of  the same size and material. Flare both ends of the undamaged  and replacement tube sections and make the connection by  using standard unions, sleeves, and tube nuts. Aluminum  6061-T6, corrosion-resistant steel 304-1/8h and Titanium  3AL-2.5V tubing can be repaired by swaged fittings. If  the damaged portion is short enough, omit the insert tube  and repair by using one repair union.  [Figure 9-30]  When  repairing a damaged line, be very careful to remove all chips  and burrs. Any open line that is to be left unattended for a  period of time should be sealed, using metal, wood, rubber,

Buna-S. Do not use for phosphate ester base hydraulic fluid  (Skydrol™).  

When repairing a low-pressure line using a flexible fluid  connection assembly, position the hose clamps carefully  to prevent overhang of the clamp bands or chafing of the  tightening screws on adjacent parts. If chafing can occur,  the hose clamps should be repositioned on the hose.  Figure 9-31  illustrates the design of a flexible fluid connection  assembly and gives the maximum allowable angular and  dimensional offset.  

When replacing rigid tubing, ensure that the layout of the new  line is the same as that of the line being replaced. Remove the  damaged or worn assembly, taking care not to further damage  or distort it, and use it as a forming template for the new part.  If the old length of tubing cannot be used as a pattern, make  a wire template, bending the pattern by hand as required for  the new assembly. Then bend the tubing to match the wire  pattern. Never select a path that does not require bends in  the tubing. A tube cannot be cut or flared accurately enough  so that it can be installed without bending and still be free  from mechanical strain. Bends are also necessary to permit  the tubing to expand or contract under temperature changes  and to absorb vibration. If the tube is small (under   $\%"$  ) and  can be hand formed, casual bends may be made to allow  for this. If the tube must be machine formed, definite bends  must be made to avoid a straight assembly. Start all bends a  reasonable distance from the fittings because the sleeves and  nuts must be slipped back during the fabrication of flares and  during inspections. In all cases, the new tube assembly should  be so formed prior to installation that it is not necessary to  pull or deflect the assembly into alignment by means of the  coupling nuts.  

# Flexible Hose Fluid Lines  

Flexible hose is used in aircraft fluid systems to connect  moving parts with stationary parts in locations subject to  vibration or where a great amount of flexibility is needed. It  can also serve as a connector in metal tubing systems.  

# Hose Materials & Construction  

Pure rubber is never used in the construction of flexible fluid  lines. To meet the requirements of strength, durability, and  workability, among other factors, synthetics are used in place  of pure rubber. Synthetic materials most commonly used in  the manufacture of flexible hose are Buna-N, neoprene, butyl,  ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM) and Teflon™.  While Teflon™ is in a category of its own, the others are  synthetic rubber.  

# Buna-  $\mathbf{\nabla}.N$  

Buna-  $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{N}$   is a synthetic rubber compound that has excellent  resistance to petroleum products. Do not confuse with  

# Neoprene  

Neoprene is a synthetic rubber compound that has an  acetylene base. Its resistance to petroleum products is not  as good as Buna-N, but it has better abrasive resistance. Do  not use for phosphate ester base hydraulic fluid (Skydrol™).  

# Butyl  

Butyl is a synthetic rubber compound made from petroleum  raw materials. It is an excellent material to use with phosphate  ester base hydraulic fluid (Skydrol™). Do not use with  petroleum products.  

Flexible rubber hose consists of a seamless synthetic rubber  inner tube covered with layers of cotton braid and wire braid  and an outer layer of rubber-impregnated cotton braid. This  type of hose is suitable for use in fuel, oil, coolant, and  hydraulic systems. The types of hose are normally classified  by the amount of pressure they are designed to withstand  under normal operating conditions: low, medium, and high.  

•	 Low pressure—below 250 psi. Fabric braid  reinforcement. •	 Medium pressure—up to 3,000 psi. One wire braid  reinforcement. Smaller sizes carry up to 3,000 psi.  Larger sizes carry pressure up to 1,500 psi. •	 High pressure—all sizes up to 3,000 psi operating  pressures.  

Flexible hoses used for brake systems have sometimes a  stainless steel wire braid installed over the hose to protect  the hose from damage.  [Figure 9-32]  

# Hose Identification  

Lay lines and identification markings consisting of  lines, letters, and numbers are printed on the hose.  [Figure 9-33]  Most hydraulic hose is marked to identify  its type, the quarter and year of manufacture, and a 5-digit  code identifying the manufacturer. These markings are in  contrasting colored letters and numerals that indicate the  

![](images/68df9aca36c7ee30c2d99c4f638f8e353186b9563a36007bf7fbd155c6ead5ae.jpg)

natural lay (no twist) of the hose and are repeated at intervals  of not more than 9 inches along the length of the hose. Code  markings assist in replacing a hose with one of the same  specifications or a recommended substitute. Hose suitable  for use with phosphate ester base hydraulic fluid is marked  Skydrol™ use. In some instances, several types of hose  may be suitable for the same use. Therefore, to make the  correct hose selection, always refer to the applicable aircraft  maintenance or parts manual.  

Teflon™ is the DuPont trade name for tetra flu oro ethylene  resin. It has a broad operating temperature range   $(-65\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $+450~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). It is compatible with nearly every substance or  agent used. It offers little resistance to flow; sticky, viscous  materials do not adhere to it. It has less volumetric expansion  than rubber, and the shelf and service life is practically  limitless. Teflon™ hose is flexible and designed to meet the  requirements of higher operating temperatures and pressures  in present aircraft systems. Generally, it may be used in the  same manner as rubber hose. Teflon™ hose is processed and  extruded into tube shape to a desired size. It is covered with  stainless steel wire, which is braided over the tube for strength  and protection. Teflon™ hose is unaffected by any known  fuel, petroleum, or synthetic base oils, alcohol, coolants,  or solvents commonly used in aircraft. Teflon™ hose has  the distinct advantages of a practically unlimited storage  time, greater operating temperature range, and broad usage  (hydraulic, fuel, oil, coolant, water, alcohol, and pneumatic  systems). Medium-pressure Teflon™ hose assemblies are  sometimes preformed to clear obstructions and to make  connections using the shortest possible hose length. Since  preforming permits tighter bends that eliminate the need for

special elbows, preformed hose assemblies save space and  weight. Never straighten a preformed hose assembly. Use a  support wire if the hose is to be removed for maintenance.  [Figure 9-34]  

# Flexible Hose Inspection  

Check the hose and hose assemblies for deterioration at each  inspection period. Leakage, separation of the cover or braid  from the inner tube, cracks, hardening, lack of flexibility, or  excessive “cold flow” are apparent signs of deterioration and  reason for replacement. The term “cold flow” describes the  deep, permanent impressions in the hose produced by the  pressure of hose clamps or supports.  

When failure occurs in a flexible hose equipped with swaged  end fittings, the entire assembly must be replaced. Obtain a  new hose assembly of the correct size and length, complete  with factory installed end fittings. When failure occurs in hose  

![](images/ee58dd679bb182200109fa656b9e219a0a6ca7834bb9a655c5952d056c73f115.jpg)  
Figure 9-33.   Hose identification markings.  

equipped with reusable end fittings, a replacement line can be  fabricated with the use of such tooling as may be necessary to  comply with the assembly instructions of the manufacturer.  

# Fabrication & Replacement of Flexible Hose  

To make a hose assembly, select the proper size hose and  end fitting.  [Figure 9-35]  MS-type end fittings for flexible  hose are detachable and may be reused if determined to be  serviceable. The inside diameter of the fitting is the same  as the inside diameter of the hose to which it is attached.  [Figure 9-36]  

![](images/7b0815bda5a14ae65721971ee2dbe4eda145c380902a3af1e314109e3795b6b3.jpg)  
Figure 9-34.   Suggested handling of preformed hose.  

# Flexible Hose Testing  

All flexible hose must be proof-tested after assembly and  applying pressure to the inside of the hose assembly. The  proof-test medium may be a liquid or gas. For example,  hydraulic, fuel, and oil lines are generally tested using  hydraulic oil or water, whereas air or instrument lines  are tested with dry, oil-free air or nitrogen. When testing  with a liquid, all trapped air is bled from the assembly  prior to tightening the cap or plug. Hose tests, using a gas,  are conducted underwater. In all cases, follow the hose  manufacturer’s instructions for proof-test pressure and  fluid to be used when testing a specific hose assembly.  [Figure 9-37]  

When a flexible hose has been repaired or overhauled using  existing hardware and new hose material, and before the hose  is installed on the aircraft, it is recommended that the hose be  tested to at least 1.5 system pressure. A hydraulic hose burst  test stand is used for testing flexible hose.  [Figure 9-38]  A  new hose can be operationally checked after it is installed in  the aircraft using system pressure.  

# Size Designations  

Hose is also designated by a dash number according to its  size. The dash number is stenciled on the side of the hose and  indicates the size tubing with which the hose is compatible.  It does not denote inside or outside diameter. When the dash  number of the hose corresponds with the dash number of  the tubing, the proper size hose is being used.  [Figure 9-33]

2. Locate length of hose to  be cut off and slit cover  with knife to wire braid,  taking care to not damage  underlying materials. After  slitting cover, twist off with  pair of pliers. (See note  below.)

4. \*Lubricate inside of hose  and nipple threads liberally.  

NOTE:  Hose assemblies fabricated per MIL-H-8790 must have the exposed wire  braid coated with a special  sealant.

5. Screw nipple into socket  using wrench on hex of  nipple and leave   $005"$   to   $.031"$   clearance between  nipple hex and socket.  

NOTE:  Step 2 applies to high-  pressure hose only.  

\*CAUTION:  Do not use any  petroleum product with hose  designed for synthetic fluids  (Skydrol™ and/or HYJET  product). For a lubricant  during assembly, use a  vegetable soap liquid.  

Disassemble in reverse order.

Figure 9-38.   Hydraulic hose burst test stand.  

# Hose Fittings  

Flexible hose may be equipped with either swaged fittings or  detachable fittings, or they may be used with beads and hose  clamps. Hoses equipped with swaged fittings are ordered by  correct length from the manufacturer and ordinarily cannot  be assembled by the mechanic. They are swaged and tested  at the factory and are equipped with standard fittings. The  detachable fittings used on flexible hoses may be detached  and reused if they are not damaged; otherwise, new fittings  must be used.  [Figure 9-39]  

# Installation of Flexible Hose Assemblies  

# Slack  

Hose assemblies must not be installed in a manner that causes  a mechanical load on the hose. When installing flexible hose,  provide slack or bend in the hose line from 5 to 8 percent of  its total length to provide for changes in length that occurs  when pressure is applied. Flexible hose contracts in length  and expands in diameter when pressurized. Protect all flexible  hoses from excessive temperatures, either by locating the lines  so they are not affected or by installing shrouds around them.  

# Flex  

When hose assemblies are subject to considerable vibration  or flexing, sufficient slack must be left between rigid fittings.  Install the hose so that flexure does not occur at the end  fittings. The hose must remain straight for at least two hose  diameters from the end fittings. Avoid clamp locations that  restrict or prevent hose flexure.  

# Twisting  

Hoses must be installed without twisting to avoid possible  rupture of the hose or loosening of the attaching nuts. Use of  swivel connections at one or both ends relieve twist stresses.  Twisting of the hose can be determined from the identification  

![](images/fea85b581ea193eccf6f251c3d7c740cad459335ef088d95ad7f76221676a9c3.jpg)  
Figure 9-39.   Reusable fittings for medium-pressure hose.  

stripe running along its length. This stripe should not spiral  around the hose.  

# Bending  

To avoid sharp bends in the hose assembly, use elbow  fittings, hose with elbow-type end fittings, or the appropriate  bend radii. Bends that are too sharp reduce the bursting  pressure of flexible hose considerably below its rated value.  [Figure 9-40]  

# Clearance  

The hose assembly must clear all other lines, equipment, and  adjacent structure under every operating condition.  

Flexible hose should be installed so that it is subject to a  minimum of flexing during operation. Although hose must  be supported at least every 24 inches, closer supports are  desirable. Flexible hose must never be stretched tightly  between two fittings. If clamps do not seal at specified  tightening, examine hose connections and replace parts as  necessary. The above is for initial installation and should not  be used for loose clamps.  

For retightening loose hose clamps in service, proceed as  follows:  

•	 Non-self-sealing hose—if the clamp screw cannot  be tightened with the fingers, do not disturb unless  leakage is evident. If leakage is present, tighten one- fourth turn.  •	 Self-sealing hose—if looser than finger-tight, tighten  to finger-tight and add one-fourth turn.  [Figure 9-41]  

# Planning Hose Line Installations  

![](images/c4c4950f608b27931cdf23a038a52c960eea5c3ac54c71cc03990127fc1762f9.jpg)  
1. Provide slack or bend in the hose line to provide for changes   in length that will occur when pressure is applied.  

![](images/fe36cd114758f0dd25cbf67cbde7a31b8cb6f07a8111f7d812da43543dcb6d06.jpg)

4. Provide additional bend radius when lines are subject to   flexing and remember that the metal end fittings are not   flexible. Place line support clamps so as not to restrict   hose flexing.  

![](images/4e42a1625c56cd35a2b5a12c9f2e29aa938b19046cd60384845f6d1f1ddec9ed.jpg)  
3. Relieve sharp bends, avoid strain or hose collapse, and make   cleaner installations by using Aeroquip elbows or other   adapter fittings. Provide as large a bend radius as possible.   Never use less than the recommended minimum bend   radius specified for the hose.  

Figure 9-40.   Flexible hose installation.  

# Hose Clamps  

To ensure proper sealing of hose connections and to prevent  breaking hose clamps or damaging the hose, follow the hose  clamp tightening instructions carefully. When available, use  the hose clamp torque-limiting wrench. These wrenches  are available in calibrations of 15 and 25 in-lb limits. In the  absence of torque-limiting wrenches, follow the finger-tight- plus-turns method. Because of the variations in hose clamp  design and hose structure, the values given in  Figure 9-41  are  approximate. Therefore, use good judgment when tightening  hose clamps by this method. Since hose connections are subject  to “cold flow” or a setting process, a follow-up tightening  check should be made for several days after installation.  

Support clamps are used to secure the various lines to the  airframe or powerplant assemblies. Several types of support  clamps are used for this purpose. The most commonly  used clamps are the rubber-cushioned and plain. The  rubber-cushioned clamp is used to secure lines subject to  vibration; the cushioning prevents chafing of the tubing.  

![Figure 9-41.   Hose clamp tightening. ](images/4ec2865ca5c61507e2d36a340843065fb285f5b3c3dd69cc0cb1cae1bef2664f.jpg)  

[Figure 9-42]  The plain clamp is used to secure lines in areas  not subject to vibration.  

A Teflon™-cushioned clamp is used in areas where the  deteriorating effect of Skydrol™, hydraulic fluid, or fuel  is expected. However, because it is less resilient, it does  not provide as good a vibration-damping effect as other  cushion materials.  

Use bonded clamps to secure metal hydraulic, fuel, or oil lines  in place. Unbonded clamps should be used only for securing  wiring. Remove any paint or anodizing from the portion of the  tube at the bonding clamp location. Make certain that clamps  are of the correct size. Clamps or supporting clips smaller  than the outside diameter of the hose may restrict the flow  of fluid through the hose. All fluid lines must be secured at  specified intervals. The maximum distance between supports  for rigid tubing is shown in  Figure 9-43.  

![](images/86cf24c46e82819b4f85a050c03046091d0a4e4d12a076dd62092b863f8196ce.jpg)

# Chapter 10 Inspection Concepts & Techniques  

Inspections are visual examinations and manual checks to  determine the condition of an aircraft or component. An  aircraft inspection can range from a casual walk around to a  detailed inspection involving complete disassembly and the  use of complex inspection aids.  

An inspection system consists of several processes, including  reports made by mechanics, the pilot, or crew flying an  aircraft and regularly scheduled inspections of an aircraft. An  inspection system is designed to maintain an aircraft in the  best possible condition. Thorough and repeated inspections  must be considered the backbone of a good maintenance  program. Irregular and haphazard inspections invariably  result in gradual and certain deterioration of an aircraft. The  time spent repairing an abused aircraft often totals far more  than any time saved in hurrying through routine inspections  and maintenance.  

It has been proven that regularly scheduled inspections and  preventive maintenance assure airworthiness. Operating  failures and malfunctions of equipment are appreciably  reduced if excessive wear or minor defects are detected  and corrected early. The importance of inspections and the  proper use of records concerning these inspections cannot  be overemphasized.  

Airframe and engine inspections may range from preflight  inspections to detailed inspections. The time intervals for the  inspection periods vary with the models of aircraft involved  and the types of operations being conducted. The airframe  and engine manufacturer’s instructions should be consulted  when establishing inspection intervals.  

Aircraft may be inspected using a flight hours inspection  system, a calendar inspection system, or a combination of  both. Under the calendar inspection system, the appropriate  inspection is performed on the expiration of a specified  number of calendar weeks. The calendar inspection system  is an efficient system from a maintenance management  standpoint. Scheduled replacement of components with stated  hourly operating limitations is normally accomplished during  the calendar inspection falling nearest the hourly limitation. In some instances, a flight hour limitation is established  to limit the number of hours that may be flown during the  calendar interval.  

Aircraft operating under the flight hour system are inspected  when a specified number of flight hours are accumulated.  Components with stated hourly operating limitations are  normally replaced during the inspection that falls nearest  the hourly limitation.  

# Basic Inspection  

# Techniques/Practices  

Before starting an inspection, be certain all plates, access  doors, fairings, and cowling have been opened or removed  and the structure cleaned. When opening inspection plates  and cowling, and before cleaning the area, take note of any  oil or other evidence of fluid leakage.  

# Preparation  

In order to conduct a thorough inspection, a great deal of  paperwork and/or reference information must be accessed  and studied before proceeding to the aircraft to conduct the  inspection. The aircraft logbooks must be reviewed to provide  background information and a maintenance history of the  particular aircraft. The appropriate checklist or checklists  must be utilized to ensure that no items are forgotten or  overlooked during the inspection. Also, many additional  publications must be available, either in hard copy or in  electronic format, to assist in the inspections. These additional  publications may include information provided by the aircraft  and engine manufacturers, appliance manufacturers, parts  vendors, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  

# Aircraft Logs  

“Aircraft logs,” as used in this handbook, is an inclusive  term that applies to the aircraft logbook and all supplemental  records concerned with the aircraft. They may come in a  variety of formats. For a small aircraft, the log may indeed  be a small  $5"\times8"$   logbook. For larger aircraft, the logbooks  are often larger and in the form of a three-ring binder. Aircraft  that have been in service for a long time are likely to have  several logbooks.  

The aircraft logbook is the record where all data concerning  the aircraft is recorded. Information gathered in this log is  used to determine the aircraft condition, date of inspections,  time on airframe, engines, and propellers. It reflects a  history of all significant events occurring to the aircraft, its  components, and accessories. Additionally, it provides a place  for indicating compliance with FAA airworthiness directives  (ADs) or manufacturers’ service bulletins (SB). The more  comprehensive the logbook, the easier it is to understand the  aircraft’s maintenance history.  

When the inspections are completed, appropriate entries  must be made in the aircraft logbook certifying that the  aircraft is in an airworthy condition and may be returned to  service. When making logbook entries, exercise special care  to ensure that the entry can be clearly understood by anyone  having a need to read it in the future. Also, if making a  hand-written entry, use good penmanship and write legibly.  To some degree, the organization, comprehensiveness, and  appearance of the aircraft logbooks have an impact on the  value of the aircraft. High quality logbooks can mean a  higher value for the aircraft.  

# Checklists  

Always use a checklist when performing an inspection.  The checklist may be of your own design, one provided  by the manufacturer of the equipment being inspected, or  one obtained from some other source. The checklist should  include the following:

# Publications  

Aeronautical publications are the sources of information  for guiding aviation mechanics in the operation and  maintenance of aircraft and related equipment. The  proper use of these publications greatly aid in the  efficient operation and maintenance of all aircraft. These  include manufacturers’ SBs, manuals, and catalogs; FAA  regulations; ADs; advisory circulars (ACs); and aircraft,  engine, and propeller specifications.  

# Manufacturers’ Service Bulletins/Instructions  

Service bulletins or service instructions are two of several  types of publications issued by airframe, engine, and  component manufacturers. The bulletins may include:  purpose for issuing the publication; name of the applicable  airframe, engine, or component; detailed instructions for  service, adjustment, modification or inspection, and source  of parts, if required; and estimated number of man-hours  required to accomplish the job.  

# Maintenance Manual  

The manufacturer’s aircraft maintenance manual contains  complete instructions for maintenance of all systems and  components installed in the aircraft. It contains information  for the mechanic who normally works on components,  assemblies, and systems while they are installed in the  aircraft, but not for the overhaul mechanic. A typical aircraft  maintenance manual contains:  

•	 A description of the systems (i.e., electrical, hydraulic,  fuel, control) •	 Lubrication instructions setting forth the frequency  and the lubricants and fluids that are to be used in the  various systems •	 Pressures and electrical loads applicable to the various  systems •	 Tolerances and adjustments necessary to proper  functioning of the airplane •	 Methods of leveling, raising, and towing •	 Methods of balancing control surfaces •	 Identification of primary and secondary structures •	 Frequency and extent of inspections necessary to the  proper operation of the airplane  

•	 Special repair methods applicable to the airplane •	 Special inspection techniques requiring x-ray,  ultrasonic, or magnetic particle inspection •	 A list of special tools  

# Overhaul Manual  

The manufacturer’s overhaul manual contains brief  descriptive information and detailed step-by-step instructions  covering work normally performed on a unit that has been  removed from the aircraft. Simple, inexpensive items, such  as switches and relays where overhaul is uneconomical, are  not covered in the overhaul manual.  

# Structural Repair Manual  

The structural repair manual contains the manufacturer’s  information and specific instructions for repairing primary  and secondary structures. Typical skin, frame, rib, and stringer  repairs are covered in this manual. Also, included are material  and fastener substitutions and special repair techniques.  

# Illustrated Parts Catalog  

The illustrated parts catalog presents component breakdowns  of structure and equipment in disassembly sequence. Also,  included are exploded views or cutaway illustrations for all  parts and equipment manufactured by the aircraft manufacturer.  

# Wiring Diagram Manual  

The wiring diagram manual is a collection of diagrams,  drawings, and lists that define the wiring and hook up of  associated equipment installed on airplanes. The data is  organized in accordance with the Air Transport Association  ATA iSPec 2200 specification.  

# Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs)  

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) were established  by law to provide for the safe and orderly conduct of  flight operations and to prescribe airmen privileges and  limitations. A knowledge of the CFRs is necessary during the  performance of maintenance, since all work done on aircraft  must comply with CFR provisions.  

# Airworthiness Directives (ADs)  

A primary safety function of the FAA is to require correction  of unsafe conditions found in an aircraft, aircraft engine,  propeller, or appliance when such conditions exist and are  likely to exist or develop in other products of the same  design. The unsafe condition may exist because of a design  defect, maintenance, or other causes. Title 14 of the CFR  part 39, Airworthiness Directives, defines the authority  and responsibility of the administrator for requiring the  necessary corrective action. The ADs are published to  notify aircraft owners and other interested persons of  unsafe conditions and to prescribe the conditions that the  product may continue to be operated. Furthermore, these  are federal aviation regulations and must be complied with  unless specific exemption is granted.  

There are two categories of ADs:  

1.	 Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate  compliance upon receipt. 2.	 Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance  within a relatively longer period of time.  

Also, ADs may be a one-time compliance item or a recurring  item that requires future inspection on an hourly basis (accrued  flight time since last compliance) or a calendar time basis.  

The contents of ADs include the aircraft, engine, propeller, or  appliance model and serial numbers affected. Also, included  are the compliance time or period, a description of the  difficulty experienced, and the necessary corrective action.  

# Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS)  

The type certificate data sheet (TCDS) describes the type  design and sets forth the limitations prescribed by the  applicable CFR part. It also includes any other limitations  and information found necessary for type certification of a  particular model aircraft.  [Figure 10-1]  

All TCDS are numbered in the upper right corner of each  page. This number is the same as the type certificate number.  The name of the type certificate holder, together with all of  the approved models, appears immediately below the type  certificate number. The issue date completes this group. This  information is contained within a bordered text box to set it off.  

The TCDS is separated into one or more sections. Each  section is identified by a Roman numeral followed by the  model designation of the aircraft that the section pertains. The  category or categories that the aircraft can be certificated in  are shown in parentheses following the model number. Also,  included is the approval date shown on the type certificate.  

The data sheet contains information regarding:  

1.	 Model designation of all engines that the aircraft  manufacturer obtained approval for use with this  model aircraft. 2.	 Minimum fuel grade to be used. 3.	 Maximum continuous and takeoff ratings of the  approved engines, including manifold pressure (when  used), rotations per minute (rpm), and horsepower (hp). 4.	 Name of the manufacturer and model designation for  each propeller that the aircraft manufacturer obtained  

approval is shown together with the propeller limits  and any operating restrictions peculiar to the propeller  

or propeller engine combination. 5.	 Airspeed limits in both miles per hour (mph) and knots. 6.	 Center of gravity (CG) range for the extreme loading  conditions of the aircraft is given in inches from the  datum. The range may also be stated in percent of  mean aerodynamic chord   $(\%\mathrm{MAC})$   for transport  category aircraft. 7.	 Empty weight center of gravity (EWCG) range (when  established) is given as fore and aft limits in inches  from the datum. If no range exists, the word “none”  is shown following the heading on the data sheet. 8.	 Location of the datum. 9.	 Means provided for leveling the aircraft. 10.	 All pertinent maximum weights. 11.	 Number of seats and their moment arms. 12.	 Oil and fuel capacity. 13.	 Control surface movements. 14.	 Required equipment. 15.	 Additional or special equipment found necessary for  certification. 16.	 Information concerning required placards.  

It is not within the scope of this handbook to list all the items  that can be shown on the TCDS. Those items listed above  serve only to acquaint aviation mechanics with the type of  information generally included on the data sheets. TCDS  may be many pages in length.  

When conducting a required or routine inspection, it is  necessary to ensure that the aircraft and all the major items  on it are as defined in the TCDS. The inspector ensures that  all installed aircraft equipment conforms to the TCDS. This  is called a conformity check and verifies that the aircraft  conforms to the specifications of the aircraft as it was  originally certified. Sometimes alterations are made that are  not specified or authorized in the TCDS. When that condition  exists, a supplemental type certificate (STC) is issued. STCs  are considered a part of the permanent records of an aircraft  and should be maintained as part of that aircraft’s logs.  

# Routine/Required Inspections  

For the purpose of determining their overall condition, 14  CFR provides for the inspection of all civil aircraft at specific  intervals, depending generally upon the type of operations  that they are engaged in. The pilot-in-command (PIC)  of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether  that aircraft is in a condition for safe flight. Therefore, the  aircraft must be inspected before each flight. More detailed  inspections must be conducted by aviation maintenance  technicians (AMTs at least once each 12 calendar months,  while inspection is required for others after each 100 hours  of flight. In other instances, an aircraft may be inspected in  accordance with a system set up to provide for total inspection  of the aircraft over a calendar or flight time period. These  include phase-type inspections.  

To determine the specific inspection requirements and  rules for the performance of inspections, refer to the CFR  that prescribes the requirements for the inspection and  maintenance of aircraft in various types of operations.  

# Preflight/Postflight Inspections  

Pilots are required to follow a checklist contained within  the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) when operating  aircraft. The first section of the checklist is entitled “Preflight  Inspection.” The preflight inspection checklist includes  a “walk-around” section listing items that the pilot is to  visually check for general condition as they walk around  the airplane. Also, the pilot must ensure that fuel, oil, and  other items required for flight are at the proper levels and not  contaminated. Additionally, it is the pilot’s responsibility to  review the aircraft maintenance records, and other required  paperwork to verify that the aircraft is indeed airworthy. After  each flight, it is recommended that the pilot or mechanic  conduct a postflight inspection to detect any problems that  might require repair or servicing before the next flight.  

# Annual/100-Hour Inspections  

The basic requirements for annual and 100-hour inspections are  discussed in 14 CFR part 91. With some exceptions, all aircraft  must have a complete inspection annually. Aircraft that are used  for commercial purposes (carrying any person, other than a  crewmember, for hire or flight instruction for hire) and are likely  to be used more frequently than noncommercial aircraft must  have this complete inspection every 100 hours. The scope and  detail of items to be included in annual and 100-hour inspections  is included as Appendix D to part 43.  [Figure 10-2]  

A properly written checklist, such as the one shown earlier in  this chapter, includes all the items of Appendix D. Although  the scope and detail of annual and 100-hour inspections are  identical, there are two significant differences. One difference  involves persons authorized to conduct them. A certified  airframe and powerplant (A&P) maintenance technician can  conduct a 100-hour inspection, whereas an annual inspection  must be conducted by a certified A&P maintenance technician  with inspection authorization (IA). The other difference  involves authorized overflight of the maximum 100 hours  before inspection. An aircraft may be flown up to 10 hours  beyond the 100-hour limit if necessary to fly to a destination

inspection of systems and components. They might occur  only three to six times during the service life of an aircraft.  

# Progressive Inspections  

Because the scope and detail of an annual inspection is  very extensive and could keep an aircraft out of service  for a considerable length of time, alternative inspection  programs designed to minimize down time may be utilized.  A progressive inspection program allows an aircraft to be  inspected progressively. The scope and detail of an annual  inspection is essentially divided into segments or phases  (typically four to six). Completion of all the phases completes  a cycle that satisfies the requirements of an annual inspection.  The advantage of such a program is that any required segment  may be completed overnight and thus enable the aircraft to  fly daily without missing any revenue earning potential.  Progressive inspection programs include routine items, such  as engine oil changes, and detailed items, such as flight  control cable inspection. Routine items are accomplished  each time the aircraft comes in for a phase inspection, and  detailed items focus on detailed inspection of specific areas.  Detailed inspections are typically done once each cycle. A  cycle must be completed within 12 months. If all required  phases are not completed within 12 months, the remaining  phase inspections must be conducted before the end of the   $12^{\mathrm{th}}$   month from when the first phase was completed.  

Each registered owner or operator of an aircraft desiring to  use a progressive inspection program must submit a written  request to the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)  having jurisdiction over the area that the applicant is located.  Section 91.409(d) of 14 CFR part 91 establishes procedures  to be followed for progressive inspections.  [Figure 10-3]  

# Continuous Inspections  

Continuous inspection programs are similar to progressive  inspection programs, except that they apply to large or  turbine-powered aircraft and are therefore more complicated. Like progressive inspection programs, they require approval  by the FAA Administrator. The approval may be sought  based upon the type of operation and the CFR parts that  the aircraft is operated under. The maintenance program  for commercially operated aircraft must be detailed in  the approved operations specifications (OpSpecs) of the  commercial certificate holder.  

Airlines utilize a continuous maintenance program that  includes both routine and detailed inspections. However, the  detailed inspections may include different levels of detail.  Often referred to as “checks,” the A-checks, B-checks,  C-checks, and D-checks involve increasing levels of detail.  A-checks are the least comprehensive and occur frequently.  D-checks, on the other hand, are extremely comprehensive,  involving major disassembly, removal, overhaul, and  

# Altimeter & Transponder Inspections  

Aircraft that are operated in controlled airspace under  instrument flight rules (IFR) must have each altimeter and  static system tested in accordance with procedures described  in 14 CFR part 43, Appendix E, within the preceding 24  calendar months. Aircraft having an air traffic control (ATC)  transponder must also have each transponder checked within  the preceding 24 months. All these checks must be conducted  by appropriately certified individuals.  

# Air Transport Association iSpec 2200  

In an effort to standardize the format in which maintenance  information is presented in aircraft maintenance manuals,  Air Transport Association (now Airlines for America)issued  specifications for Manufacturers’ Technical Data. The  original specification was called ATA Spec 100. Over the  years, Spec 100 has been continuously revised and updated.  Eventually, ATA Spec 2100 was developed for electronic  documentation. These two specifications evolved into one  document called ATA iSpec 2200, developed and managed  by the ATA e-Business Program, a consensus-based industry  standards organization administered by Airlines for America  (A4A). As a result of this standardization, maintenance  technicians can always find information regarding a particular  system in the same section of an aircraft maintenance  manual, regardless of manufacturer. For example, if seeking  information about the electrical system on any aircraft, that  information is always found in section (chapter) 24.  

The ATA iSpec 2200 divides the aircraft into systems, such  as air conditioning, that covers the basic air conditioning  system (ATA 21). Numbering in each major system provides  an arrangement for breaking the system down into several  subsystems.  [Figure 10-4]  Late model aircraft, both over and  under the 12,500-pound designation, have their parts manuals  and maintenance manuals arranged according to the ATA- coded system. The following abbreviated table of ATA System,  Subsystem, and Titles is included for familiarization purposes.  

Keep in mind that not all aircraft have all these systems  installed. Small and simple aircraft have fewer systems than  larger, more complex aircraft.  

# Special Inspections  

During the service life of an aircraft, occasions may arise  when something out of the ordinary care and use of an aircraft  could possibly affect its airworthiness. When these situations  are encountered, special inspection procedures, also called  conditional inspections, are followed to determine if damage  to the aircraft structure has occurred. The procedures

#  ${\pmb\S}\,{\pmb9}1.{\pmb409}$   Inspections.  

(d)	 Progressive inspection. Each registered owner or operator of  an aircraft desiring to use a progressive inspection program  must submit a written request to the FAA Flight Standards  district office having jurisdiction over the area in which the  applicant is located, and shall provide— (1)	 A certificated mechanic holding an inspection  authorization, a certificated airframe repair station, or  the manufacturer of the aircraft to supervise or conduct  the progressive inspection; (2)	 A current inspection procedures manual available  and readily understandable to pilot and maintenance  personnel containing, in detail— (i)	 An explanation of the progressive inspection,  including the continuity of inspection  responsibility, the making of reports, and the  keeping of records and technical reference  material; (ii)	 An inspection schedule, specifying the intervals  in hours or days when routine and detailed  inspections will be performed and including  instructions for exceeding an inspection interval  by not more than 10 hours while en route and  for changing an inspection interval because of  service experience; (iii)	 Sample routine and detailed inspection forms  and instructions for their use; and (iv)	 Sample reports and records and instructions for  their use;  

(4)	 Appropriate current technical information for the  aircraft. The frequency and detail of the progressive inspection shall  provide for the complete inspection of the aircraft within each  12 calendar months and be consistent with the manufacturer's  recommendations, field service experience, and the kind of  operation in which the aircraft is engaged. The progressive  inspection schedule must ensure that the aircraft, at all times,  will be airworthy and will conform to all applicable FAA  aircraft specifications, type certificate data sheets, airworthiness  directives, and other approved data. If the progressive inspection  is discontinued, the owner or operator shall immediately notify  the local FAA Flight Standards district office, in writing, of  the discontinuance. After the discontinuance, the first annual  inspection under   $\S91.409$  (a)(1) is due within 12 calendar months  after the last complete inspection of the aircraft under the  progressive inspection. The 100-hour inspection under  $\S91.409(\mathfrak{b})$  )  is due within 100 hours after that complete inspection. A complete  inspection of the aircraft, for the purpose of determining when  the annual and 100-hour inspections are due, requires a detailed  inspection of the aircraft and all its components in accordance with  the progressive inspection. A routine inspection of the aircraft and  a detailed inspection of several components is not considered to  be a complete inspection.  

outlined on the following pages are general in nature and  are intended to acquaint the aviation mechanic with the areas  to be inspected. As such, they are not all inclusive. When  performing any of these special inspections, always follow  the detailed procedures in the aircraft maintenance manual.  In situations where the manual does not adequately address  the situation, seek advice from other maintenance technicians  who are highly experienced with them. The following  paragraphs describe some typical types of special inspections.  

Wrinkled wing skin is the most easily detected sign of  an excessive load having been imposed during a landing.  Another indication easily detected is fuel leakage along  riveted seams. Other possible locations of damage are spar  webs, bulkheads, nacelle skin and attachments, firewall skin,  and wing and fuselage stringers. If none of these areas show  adverse effects, it is reasonable to assume that no serious  damage has occurred. If damage is detected, a more extensive  inspection and alignment check may be necessary.  

# Hard or Overweight Landing Inspection  

# Severe Turbulence Inspection/Over “G”  

The structural stress induced by a landing depends not only  upon the gross weight at the time, but also upon the severity  of impact. The hard landing inspection is for hard landings at  or below the maximum design landing limits. An overweight  landing inspection must be performed when an airplane lands at  a weight above the maximum design landing weight. However,  because of the difficulty in estimating vertical velocity at the  time of contact, it is hard to judge whether or not a landing  has been sufficiently severe to cause structural damage. For  this reason, a special inspection is performed after a landing is  made at a weight known to exceed the design landing weight or  after a rough landing, even though the latter may have occurred  when the aircraft did not exceed the design landing weight.  

When an aircraft encounters a gust condition, the airload  on the wings exceeds the normal wingload supporting the  aircraft weight. The gust tends to accelerate the aircraft while  its inertia acts to resist this change. If the combination of gust  velocity and airspeed is too severe, the induced stress can  cause structural damage.  

A special inspection is performed after a flight through severe  turbulence. Emphasis is placed upon inspecting the upper and  lower wing surfaces for excessive buckles or wrinkles with  permanent set. Where wrinkles have occurred, remove a few  rivets and examine the rivet shanks to determine if the rivets  have sheared or were highly loaded in shear.  

Through the inspection doors and other accessible openings,  inspect all spar webs from the fuselage to the tip. Check for  buckling, wrinkles, and sheared attachments. Inspect for  buckling in the area around the nacelles and in the nacelle  skin, particularly at the wing leading edge. Check for fuel  leaks. Any sizeable fuel leak is an indication that an area  may have received overloads that have broken the sealant  and opened the seams.  

If the landing gear was lowered during a period of severe  turbulence, inspect the surrounding surfaces carefully  for loose rivets, cracks, or buckling. The interior of the  wheel well may give further indications of excessive gust  conditions. Inspect the top and bottom fuselage skin. An  excessive bending moment may have left wrinkles of a  diagonal nature in these areas.  

Inspect the surface of the empennage for wrinkles, buckling,  or sheared attachments. Also, inspect the area of attachment  of the empennage to the fuselage. These inspections cover

the critical areas. If excessive damage is noted in any of the  areas mentioned, the inspection must be continued until all  damage is detected.  

# Lightning Strike  

Although lightning strikes to aircraft are extremely rare,  if a strike has occurred, the aircraft is carefully inspected  to determine the extent of any damage that might have  occurred. When lightning strikes an aircraft, the electrical  current must be conducted through the structure and be  allowed to discharge or dissipate at controlled locations.  These controlled locations are primarily the aircraft’s static  discharge wicks, or on more sophisticated aircraft, null field  dischargers. When surges of high-voltage electricity pass  through good electrical conductors, such as aluminum or  steel, damage is likely to be minimal or nonexistent. When  surges of high-voltage electricity pass through non-metallic  structures, such as a fiberglass radome, engine cowl or fairing,  glass or plastic window, or a composite structure that does  not have built-in electrical bonding, burning and more serious  damage to the structure could occur. Visual inspection of  the structure is required. Look for evidence of degradation,  burning, or erosion of the composite resin at all affected  structures, electrical bonding straps, static discharge wicks,  and null field dischargers.  

# Bird Strike  

When the aircraft is hit by birds during flight, the external  areas of the airplane are inspected in the general area of the  bird strike. If the initial inspection shows structural damage,  then the internal structure of the airplane must be inspected  as well. Also, inspect the hydraulic, pneumatic, and any other  systems in the area of the bird strike.  

# Fire Damage  

Inspection of aircraft structures that have been subjected to fire  or intense heat can be relatively simple if visible damage is  present. Visible damage requires repair or replacement. If there  is no visible damage, the structural integrity of an aircraft may  still have been compromised. Since most structural metallic  components of an aircraft have undergone some sort of heat- treatment process during manufacture, an exposure to high  heat not encountered during normal operations could severely  degrade the design strength of the structure. The strength and  airworthiness of an aluminum structure that passes a visual  inspection, but is still suspect, can be further determined by use  of a conductivity tester. This is a device that uses eddy current  and is discussed later in this chapter. Since strength of metals is  related to hardness, possible damage to steel structures might  be determined by use of a hardness tester, such as a Rockwell  C hardness tester.   [Figure 10-5]  

# Flood Damage  

Like aircraft damaged by fire, aircraft damaged by water  can range from minor to severe. This depends on the level  of the flood water, whether it was fresh or salt water, and  the elapsed time between the flood occurrence and when  repairs were initiated. Any parts that were totally submerged  are completely disassembled, thoroughly cleaned, dried, and  treated with a corrosion inhibitor. Many parts might have to be  replaced, particularly interior carpeting, seats, side panels, and  instruments. Since water serves as an electrolyte that promotes  corrosion, all traces of water and salt must be removed before  the aircraft can again be considered airworthy.  

# Seaplanes  

Because they operate in an environment that accelerates  corrosion, seaplanes must be carefully inspected for corrosion  and conditions that promote corrosion. Inspect bilge areas  for waste hydraulic fluids, water, dirt, drill chips, and  other debris. Additionally, since seaplanes often encounter  excessive stress from the pounding of rough water at high  speeds, inspect for loose rivets and other fasteners; stretched,  bent or cracked skins; damage to the float attach fitting; and  general wear and tear on the entire structure.  

# Aerial Application Aircraft  

Two primary factors that make inspecting these aircraft  different from other aircraft are the corrosive nature of  some of the chemicals used and the typical flight profile.  Damaging effects of corrosion may be detected in a much  shorter period of time than normal use aircraft. Chemicals  may soften the fabric or loosen the fabric tapes of fabric- covered aircraft. Metal aircraft may need to have the paint  stripped, cleaned, and repainted and corrosion treated  annually. Leading edges of wings and other areas may  require protective coatings or tapes. Hardware may require  more frequent replacement.  

During peak use, these aircraft may fly up to 50 cycles  (takeoffs and landings) or more in a day, most likely from  an unimproved or grass runway. This can greatly accelerate  the failure of normal fatigue items. Landing gear and related  items require frequent inspections. Because these aircraft  operate almost continuously at very low altitudes, air filters  tend to become obstructed more rapidly.  

# Special Flight Permits  

For an aircraft that does not currently meet airworthiness  requirements because of an overdue inspection, damage,  expired replacement times for time-limited parts, or other  reasons, but is capable of safe flight, a special flight permit  may be issued. Special flight permits, often referred to as  ferry permits, are issued for the following purposes:  

•	 Flying the aircraft to a base where repairs, alterations, or  maintenance are to be performed or to a point of storage •	 Delivering or exporting the aircraft •	 Production flight testing new production aircraft •	 Evacuating aircraft from areas of impending danger •	 Conducting customer demonstration flights in new  production aircraft that have satisfactorily completed  production flight tests  

Additional information about special flight permits may be  found in 14 CFR part 21. Application forms for special flight  permits may be requested from the nearest FAA FSDO.  

# Nondestructive Inspection/Testing  

The preceding information in this chapter provided general  details regarding aircraft inspection. The remainder of  this chapter deals with several methods often used on  specific components or areas on an aircraft when carrying  out the more specific inspections. They are referred to as  nondestructive inspection (NDI) or nondestructive testing  (NDT). The objective of NDI and NDT is to determine the  airworthiness of a component, without damaging it, that  would render it unairworthy. Some of these methods are  

![](images/b0df6a5ccaf4d0f77df60cd1060f40272a00dbf55d3f22551153ae8362ae0d0c.jpg)  
Figure 10-5.   Rockwell C Hardness Tester.  

simple, requiring little additional expertise, while others are  highly sophisticated and require that the technician be highly  trained and specially certified.  

# Training, Qualification, & Certification  

The product manufacturer or the FAA generally specifies the  particular NDI method and procedure to be used in inspection.  These NDI requirements are specified in the manufacturer’s  inspection, maintenance, or overhaul manual, FAA ADs,  supplemental structural inspection documents (SSID), or SBs.  

The success of any NDI method and procedure depends  upon the knowledge, skill, and experience of the NDI  personnel involved. The person(s) responsible for detecting  and interpreting indications, such as eddy current, x-ray, or  ultrasonic NDI, must be qualified and certified to specific  FAA or other acceptable government or industry standards,  such as MIL-STD-410, Nondestructive Testing Personnel  Qualification and Certification or ATA iSpec 105, Guidelines  for Training and Qualifying Personnel in Nondestructive  Testing Methods. The person must be familiar with the test  method, know the potential types of discontinuities peculiar  to the material, and be familiar with their effect on the  structural integrity of the part. Additional information on NDI  may be found by referring to Chapter 5 of FAA AC 43.13-1,  Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices—Aircraft  Inspection and Repair.  

# Advantages & Disadvantages of NDI Methods  

Figure   $\mathit{l0-6}$   provides a table of the advantages and  disadvantages of common NDI methods. This table could  be used as a guide for evaluating the most appropriate NDI  method when the manufacturer or the FAA has not specified  a particular NDI method to be used.  

# General Techniques  

Before conducting NDI, it is necessary to follow preparatory  steps in accordance with procedures specific to that type of  inspection. Generally, the parts or areas must be thoroughly  cleaned. Some parts must be removed from the aircraft or  engine. Others might need to have any paint or protective  coating stripped. A complete knowledge of the equipment  and procedures is essential and, if required, calibration and  inspection of the equipment must be current.  

# Visual Inspection  

Visual inspection can be enhanced by looking at the suspect  area with a bright light, a magnifying glass, and a mirror. Some  defects might be so obvious that further inspection methods are  not required. The lack of visible defects does not necessarily  mean further inspection is unnecessary. Some defects may lie  beneath the surface or may be so small that the human eye, even  with the assistance of a magnifying glass, cannot detect them.  

# Surface Cracks  

When searching for surface cracks with a flashlight, direct  the light beam at a 5 to 45 degree angle to the inspection  surface towards the face.  [Figure 10-7]  Do not direct the light  beam at such an angle that the reflected light beam shines  directly into the eyes. Keep the eyes above the reflected light  beam during the inspection. Determine the extent of any  cracks found by directing the light beam at right angles to  the crack and tracing its length. Use a 10-power magnifying  glass to confirm the existence of a suspected crack. If this is  not adequate, use other NDI techniques, such as penetrant,  magnetic particle, or eddy current to verify cracks.  

# Borescope  

Inspection by use of a borescope is essentially a visual  inspection. A borescope is a device that enables the inspector  to see inside areas that could not otherwise be inspected  without disassembly. Borescopes are used in aircraft and  engine maintenance programs to reduce or eliminate the  need for costly teardowns. Aircraft turbine engines have  access ports that are specifically designed for borescopes.  Borescopes are also used extensively in a variety of aviation  maintenance programs to determine the airworthiness of  difficult to reach components. Borescopes typically are used  to inspect interiors of hydraulic cylinders and valves for  pitting, scoring, porosity, and tool marks; search for cracked  cylinders in aircraft reciprocating engines; inspect turbojet  engine turbine blades and combustion cans; verify the proper  placement and fit of seals, bonds, gaskets, and subassemblies  in difficult to reach areas; and assess foreign object damage  (FOD) in aircraft, airframe, and powerplants. Borescopes  may also be used to locate and retrieve foreign objects in  engines and airframes.  

Borescopes are available in two basic configurations. The  simpler of the two is a rigid type, small diameter telescope  with a tiny mirror at the end that enables the user to see around  corners. The other type uses fiber optics that enable greater  flexibility.  [Figure 10-8]  Many borescopes provide images  that can be displayed on a computer or video monitor for  better interpretation of what is being viewed and to record  images for future reference. Most borescopes also include a  light to illuminate the area being viewed.  

# Liquid Penetrant Inspection  

Penetrant inspection is a nondestructive test for defects open to  the surface in parts made of any nonporous material. It is used  with equal success on such metals as aluminum, magnesium,  brass, copper, cast iron, stainless steel, and titanium. It may  also be used on ceramics, plastics, molded rubber, and glass.  

Penetrant inspection detects defects, such as surface cracks  or porosity. These defects may be caused by fatigue cracks,  shrinkage cracks, shrinkage porosity, cold shuts, grinding and  heat-treat cracks, seams, forging laps, and bursts. Penetrant  inspection also indicates a lack of bond between joined metals. The main disadvantage of penetrant inspection is that the  defect must be open to the surface in order to let the penetrant  get into the defect. For this reason, if the part in question is  made of material that is magnetic, the use of magnetic particle  inspection is generally recommended.  

Penetrant inspection uses a penetrating liquid that enters a  surface opening and remains there, making it clearly visible  to the inspector. It calls for visual examination of the part  after it has been processed, increasing the visibility of the  defect so that it can be detected. Visibility of the penetrating  material is increased by the addition of one or two types of  dye: visible or fluorescent.  

The visible penetrant kit consists of dye penetrant, dye  remover emulsifier, and developer. The fluorescent penetrant  inspection kit contains a black light assembly, as well as spray  cans of penetrant, cleaner, and developer. The light assembly  consists of a power transformer, a flexible power cable, and  a hand-held lamp. Due to its size, the lamp may be used in  almost any position or location.  

The steps for performing a penetrant inspection are:  

1.	 Clean the metal surface thoroughly. 2.	 Apply penetrant. 3.	 Remove penetrant with remover emulsifier or cleaner. 4.	 Dry the part. 5.	 Apply the developer. 6.	 Inspect and interpret results.  

# Interpretation of Results  

The success and reliability of a penetrant inspection depends  upon the thoroughness that the part was prepared with.  Several basic principles applying to penetrant inspection are:  

1.	 The penetrant must enter the defect in order to form  an indication. It is important to allow sufficient time  so the penetrant can fill the defect. The defect must  be clean and free of contaminating materials so that  the penetrant is free to enter. 2.	 If all penetrant is washed out of a defect, an indication  cannot be formed. During the washing or rinsing  operation, prior to development, it is possible that the  penetrant is removed from within the defect, as well  as from the surface. 3.	 Clean cracks are usually easy to detect. Surface  openings that are uncontaminated, regardless of how  

![](images/a6df8dc0418138099a229461ad79ee0ed55961a488a9290efc5d72c593d3a65a.jpg)  

fine, are seldom difficult to detect with the penetrant  inspection.  

4.	 The smaller the defect, the longer the penetrating time. Fine crack-like apertures require a longer penetrating time than defects such as pores.

 5.	 When the part to be inspected is made of a material susceptible to magnetism, it should be inspected by a magnetic particle inspection method if the equipment  is available.

 6.	 Visible penetrant-type developer, when applied to the  surface of a part, dries to a smooth, white coating. As the developer dries, bright red indications appear where there are surface defects. If no red indications  

appear, there are no surface defects.  7.	 When conducting the fluorescent penetrant-type inspection, the defects show up (under black light) as a brilliant yellow-green color and the sound areas appear deep blue-violet. 8.	 It is possible to examine an indication of a defect and to determine its cause as well as its extent. Such an appraisal can be made if something is known about the manufacturing processes that the part has been subjected to.  

The size of the indication, or accumulation of penetrant,  shows the extent of the defect and the brilliance is a measure  of its depth. Deep cracks hold more penetrant and are  

![](images/99cb0fa9942b39e0b117464ec240b4875381b17a6d8d8eaf0017e038a0ac9a5d.jpg)  
Figure 10-7.   Using a flashlight to inspect for cracks.  

broader and more brilliant. Very fine openings can hold  only small amounts of penetrants and appear as fine lines.  [Figure 10-9]  

# False Indications  

With the penetrant inspection, there are no false indications in  the sense that they occur in the magnetic particle inspection.  There are, however, two conditions that may create  accumulations of penetrant that are sometimes confused with  true surface cracks and discontinuities.  

The first condition involves indications caused by poor  washing. If all the surface penetrant is not removed in  the washing or rinsing operation following the penetrant  dwell time, the unremoved penetrant is visible. Evidences  of incomplete washing are usually easy to identify since  the penetrant is in broad areas rather than in the sharp  patterns found with true indications. When accumulations  of unwashed penetrant are found on a part, the part must be  completely reprocessed. Degreasing is recommended for  removal of all traces of the penetrant.  

False indications may also be created where parts press fit  to each other. If a wheel is press fit onto a shaft, penetrant  shows an indication at the fit line. This is perfectly normal  since the two parts are not meant to be welded together.  Indications of this type are easy to identify since they are  regular in form and shape.  

# Eddy Current Inspection  

Electromagnetic analysis is a term describing the broad  spectrum of electronic test methods involving the intersection  of magnetic fields and circulatory currents. The most widely  used technique is the eddy current. Eddy currents are  composed of free electrons under the influence of an induced  electromagnetic field that are made to “drift” through metal.  

![](images/9e99bc3c87f351626dfb6723402058256de8006f2b4312f069ff211d6545e9b1.jpg)  
Figure 10-8.   Rigid and flexible borescopes.  

Eddy current is used to detect surface cracks, pits, subsurface  cracks, corrosion on inner surfaces, and to determine alloy  and heat-treat condition.  

Eddy current is used in aircraft maintenance to inspect  jet engine turbine shafts and vanes, wing skins, wheels,  bolt holes, and spark plug bores for cracks, heat, or  frame damage. Eddy current may also be used in repair  of aluminum aircraft damaged by fire or excessive heat.  Different meter readings are seen when the same metal is  in different hardness states. Readings in the affected area  are compared with identical materials in known unaffected  areas for comparison. A difference in readings indicates  a difference in the hardness state of the affected area.  In aircraft manufacturing plants, eddy current is used to  inspect castings, stampings, machine parts, forgings, and  extrusions.  Figure 10-10  shows a technician performing an  eddy current inspection on a fan blade.  

# Basic Principles  

When an alternating current (AC) is passed through a coil,  it develops a magnetic field around the coil, which in turn  induces a voltage of opposite polarity in the coil and opposes  the flow of original current. If this coil is placed in such a  way that the magnetic field passes through an electrically  conducting specimen, eddy currents are induced into the  specimen. The eddy currents create their own field that varies  the original field’s opposition to the flow of original current.  The specimen’s susceptibility to eddy currents determines  the current flow through the coil.  

The magnitude and phase of this counter field is dependent  primarily upon the resistance and permeability of the specimen  under consideration and enables us to make a qualitative  determination of various physical properties of the test  material. The interaction of the eddy current field with the  original field results is a power change that can be measured  by utilizing electronic circuitry similar to a Wheatstone bridge.  

![](images/497bc9d2c5503051e56cd5289e66d49d07cbcee9130364e1ad649b3a522cb2e5.jpg)  
Figure 10-9.   Dye penetrant inspection.  

# Principles of Operations  

Eddy currents are induced in a test article when an AC is  applied to a test coil (probe). The AC in the coil induces an  alternating magnetic field in the article, causing eddy currents  to flow in the article.  [Figure 10-11]  

Flaws in or thickness changes of the test-piece influence  the flow of eddy currents and change the impedance of the  coil accordingly.  [Figure 10-12]  Instruments display the  impedance changes either by impedance plane plots or by  needle deflection.  [Figure 10-13]  

The specimen is either placed in or passed through the field  of an electromagnetic induction coil, and its effect on the  impedance of the coil or on the voltage output of one or more  test coils is observed. The process that involves electric fields  made to explore a test piece for various conditions involves  the transmission of energy through the specimen much like  the transmission of x-rays, heat, or ultrasound.  

Eddy current inspection can frequently be performed without  removing the surface coatings, such as primer, paint, and  anodized films. It can be effective in detecting surface and  subsurface corrosion, pots, and heat-treat condition.  

# Eddy Current Instruments  

A wide variety of eddy current test instruments are  available. The eddy current test instrument performs three  basic functions: generating, receiving, and displaying. The  generating portion of the unit provides an alternating current  to the test coil. The receiving section processes the signal  from the test coil to the required form and amplitude for  display. Instrument outputs or displays consist of a variety  of visual, audible, storage, or transfer techniques utilizing  meters, video displays, chart recorders, alarms, magnetic  tape, computers, and electrical or electronic relays.  

A reference standard is required for the calibration of eddy  current test equipment. A reference standard is made from  the same material as the item is to be tested. A reference  standard contains known flaws or cracks and could include  items, such as a flat surface notch, a fastener head, a fastener  hole, or a countersink hole.  Figures 10-14, 10-15,  and    ${\mathit{l0-}}{\mathit{l6}}$  show typical surface cracks, subsurface cracks, and structural  corrosion that can be detected with eddy current techniques.  

# Ultrasonic Inspection  

Ultrasonic inspection is an NDI technique that uses sound  energy moving through the test specimen to detect flaws.  The sound energy passing through the specimen is displayed  on a cathode ray tube (CRT), a liquid crystal display (LCD)  computer data program, or video/camera medium. Indications  of the front and back surface and internal/external conditions  appear as vertical signals on the CRT screen or nodes of data  in the computer test program.  [Figure 10-17]  There are three  types of display patterns: “A” scan, “B” scan, and “C” scan.  Each scan provides a different picture or view of the specimen  being tested.  [Figure 10-18]  

Ultrasonic detection equipment makes it possible to locate  defects in all types of materials. Minute cracks, checks, and  voids too small to be seen by x-ray can be located by ultrasonic  inspection. An ultrasonic test instrument requires access to  only one surface of the material to be inspected and can be  used with either straight line or angle beam testing techniques.  

Two basic methods are used for ultrasonic inspection. The  first of these methods is immersion testing. In this method  of inspection, the part under examination and the search unit  are completely immersed in a liquid couplant, such as water  or other suitable fluids.  

The second method is called contact testing. It is readily  adapted to field use and is the method discussed in this  chapter. In this method, the part under examination and the  search unit are coupled with a viscous material, liquid, or a  paste that wets both the face of the search unit and the material  under examination.

Figure 10-11.   Generating an eddy current.  

There are three basic ultrasonic inspection methods: pulse  echo, through-transmission, and resonance. Through- transmission and pulse echo are shown in  Figure 10-19 .  

# Pulse Echo  

Flaws are detected by measuring the amplitude of  signals reflected and the time required for these signals  to travel between specific surfaces and the discontinuity.  [Figure 10-20]  

The time base, triggered simultaneously with each  transmission pulse, causes a spot to sweep across the screen  of the CRT or LCD. The spot sweeps from left to right across  the face of the scope 50 to 5,000 times per second or higher  if required for high-speed automated scanning. Due to the  speed of the cycle of transmitting and receiving, the picture  on the oscilloscope appears to be stationary.  

A few microseconds after the sweep is initiated, the rate  generator electrically excites the pulser, and the pulser in turn  emits an electrical pulse. The transducer converts this pulse  into a short train of ultrasonic sound waves. If the interfaces

Figure 10-13.   Impedance plane test.  

of the transducer and the specimen are properly oriented, the  ultrasound is reflected back to the transducer when it reaches  the internal flaw and the opposite surface of the specimen. The  time interval between the transmission of the initial impulse  and the reception of the signals from within the specimen are  measured by the timing circuits. The reflected pulse received  by the transducer is amplified, transmitted to, and displayed  on the instrument screen. The pulse is displayed in the same  relationship to the front and back pulses as the flaw is in relation  to the front and back surfaces of the specimen.  [Figure 10-21]  

Pulse-echo instruments may also be used to detect flaws not  directly underneath the probe by use of the angle beam testing  method. Angle beam testing differs from straight beam testing  only in the manner that the ultrasonic waves pass through  the material being tested. As shown in  Figure 10-22 , the  beam is projected into the material at an acute angle to the  surface by means of a crystal cut at an angle and mounted in  plastic. The beam, or a portion thereof, reflects successively  from the surfaces of the material or any other discontinuity,  including the edge of the piece. In straight beam testing, the  horizontal distance on the screen between the initial pulse  and the first back reflection represents the thickness of the  piece; while in angle beam testing, this distance represents  the width of the material between the searching unit and the  opposite edge of the piece.  

# Through-Transmission  

Through-transmission inspection uses two transducers, one to  generate the pulse and another placed on the opposite surface  

![](images/b0da9fe519c83e0878add114fdfa436146c8475d2e6eecee9d6d855ab6320f50.jpg)

to receive it. A disruption in the sound path indicates a flaw and  is displayed on the instrument screen. Through-transmission  is less sensitive to small defects than the pulse-echo method.  

# Resonance  

This system differs from the pulse method in that the  frequency of transmission may be continuously varied.  The resonance method is used principally for thickness  

![](images/98ca8cc890b0504166dd14fe9328020bfcc3494244d67bb1d83585615b3001bc.jpg)

Figure 10-17.   Ultrasonic inspection.  

measurements when the two sides of the material being tested  are smooth and parallel and the backside is inaccessible. The  point where the frequency matches the resonance point of  the material being tested is the thickness determining factor. It is necessary that the frequency of the ultrasonic waves  corresponding to a particular dial setting be accurately  known. Checks are made with standard test blocks to guard  against possible drift of frequency.  

If the frequency of an ultrasonic wave is such that its wavelength  is twice the thickness of a specimen (fundamental frequency),  then the reflected wave arrives back at the transducer in the  same phase as the original transmission so that strengthening  of the signal occurs. This results from constructive interference  or a resonance and is shown as a high amplitude value on  the indicating screen. If the frequency is increased such that  three times the wavelength equals four times the thickness,  the reflected signal returns completely out of phase with the  transmitted signal and cancellation occurs. Further increase  of the frequency causes the wavelength to be equal to the  thickness again and gives a reflected signal in phase with the  transmitted signal and a resonance once more. By starting at the  fundamental frequency and gradually increasing the frequency,  the successive cancellations and resonances can be noted and  the readings used to check the fundamental frequency reading.  [Figure 10-23]  

In some instruments, the oscillator circuit contains a motor- driven capacitor that changes the frequency of the oscillator.  [Figure 10-24]  In other instruments, the frequency is  changed by electronic means. The change in frequency  is synchronized with the horizontal sweep of a CRT. The  horizontal axis represents a frequency range. If the frequency  range contains resonances, the circuitry is arranged to present  these vertically. Calibrated transparent scales are then placed  in front of the tube and the thickness can be read directly.  The instruments normally operate between 0.25 millicycle  (mc) and  $10\;\mathrm{mc}$   in four or five bands.  

The resonance thickness instrument can be used to test the  thickness of such metals as steel, cast iron, brass, nickel,  copper, silver, lead, aluminum, and magnesium. In addition,  areas of corrosion or wear on tanks, tubing, airplane wing skins,  

![](images/9f733d2d1905a5ff570b1eab6ae9703f82c0656b74e4075e6f29d1d3cd7091bb.jpg)  
Figure 10-18.   Typical structural corrosion.  

and other structures or products can be located and evaluated.  Direct reading dial-operated units are available that measure  thickness between 0.025 inch and 3 inches with an accuracy  of better than  $\pm1$   percent. Ultrasonic inspection requires a  skilled operator who is familiar with the equipment being  used, as well as the inspection method to be used for the  many different parts being tested.  [Figure 10-25]  

# Ultrasonic Instruments  

A portable, battery-powered ultrasonic instrument is used  for field inspection of airplane structure.   The instrument  generates an ultrasonic pulse, detects and amplifies the  returning echo, and displays the detected signal on a  CRT or similar display. Piezoelectric transducers produce  longitudinal or shear waves, the most commonly used  waveforms for aircraft structural inspection.  

# Reference Standards  

Reference standards are used to calibrate the ultrasonic  instrument. Reference standards serve two purposes: to  provide an ultrasonic response pattern that is related to the  part being inspected and to establish the required inspection  sensitivity. To obtain a representative response pattern, the  reference standard configuration is the same as that of the  test structure or is a configuration that provides an ultrasonic  response pattern representative of the test structure. The  reference standard contains a simulated defect (notch) that  is positioned to provide a calibration signal representative  of the expected defect. The notch size is chosen to establish  inspection sensitivity (response to the expected defect size).  The inspection procedure gives a detailed description of the  required reference standard.  

# Couplants  

Inspection with ultrasonics is limited to the part in contact  with the transducer. A layer of couplant is required to couple  the transducer to the test piece, because ultrasonic energy  does not travel through air. Some typical couplants used are  water, glycerin, motor oils, and grease.  

# Inspection of Bonded Structures  

Ultrasonic inspection is finding increasing application in  aircraft bonded construction and repair. Many configurations  and types of bonded structures are in use in aircraft. All of  these variations complicate the application of ultrasonic  inspections. An inspection method that works well on one  part or one area of the part may not be applicable for different  parts or areas of the same part. Some of the variables in the  types of bonded structures are as follows:  

•	 Top skin material is made from different materials and  thickness •	 Different types and thickness of adhesives are used in  bonded structures

# Types of Defects  

Defects can be separated into five general types to represent  the various areas of bonded and laminate structures as follows:  

1.	 Type I—disbonds or voids in an outer skin-to- adhesive interface. It is necessary that the frequency of the ultrasonic  2.	 Type II—disbonds or voids at the adhesive-to-core  waves corresponding to a particular dial setting be interface. accurately known.

application of acoustic emission testing to aircraft has  required a new level of sophistication in testing technique  and data interpretation.  

# Magnetic Particle Inspection  

Magnetic particle inspection is a method of detecting invisible  cracks and other defects in ferromagnetic materials, such as  iron and steel. It is not applicable to nonmagnetic materials. In rapidly rotating, reciprocating, vibrating, and other highly- stressed aircraft parts, small defects often develop to the  point that they cause complete failure of the part. Magnetic  particle inspection has proven extremely reliable for the  rapid detection of such defects located on or near the surface.  With this method of inspection, the location of the defect is  indicated and the approximate size and shape are outlined.  

The inspection process consists of magnetizing the part and  then applying ferromagnetic particles to the surface area to be  inspected. The ferromagnetic particles (indicating medium)  may be held in suspension in a liquid that is flushed over the  part; the part may be immersed in the suspension liquid; or  the particles, in dry powder form, may be dusted over the  surface of the part. The wet process is more commonly used  in the inspection of aircraft parts.  

If a discontinuity is present, the magnetic lines of force  are disturbed and opposite poles exist on either side of the  discontinuity. The magnetized particles thus form a pattern in  the magnetic field between the opposite poles. This pattern,  known as an “indication,” assumes the approximate shape  of the surface projection of the discontinuity. A discontinuity  may be defined as an interruption in the normal physical  structure or configuration of a part, such as a crack, forging  lap, seam, inclusion, porosity, and the like. A discontinuity  may or may not affect the usefulness of a part.  

# Development of Indications  

When a discontinuity in a magnetized material is open to  the surface and a magnetic substance (indicating medium) is  available on the surface, the flux leakage at the discontinuity  tends to form the indicating medium into a path of higher  permeability. (Permeability is a term used to refer to the  ease that a magnetic flux can be established in a given  magnetic circuit.) Because of the magnetism in the part and  the adherence of the magnetic particles to each other, the  indication remains on the surface of the part in the form of an  approximate outline of the discontinuity that is immediately  below it. The same action takes place when the discontinuity  is not open to the surface, but since the amount of flux leakage  is less, fewer particles are held in place and a fainter and less  sharply defined indication is obtained.  

If the discontinuity is very far below the surface, there  may be no flux leakage and no indication on the surface.  The flux leakage at a transverse discontinuity is shown  in  Figure 10-26 . The flux leakage at a longitudinal  discontinuity is shown in  Figure 10-27 .  

# Types of Discontinuities Disclosed  

The following types of discontinuities are normally detected  by the magnetic particle test: cracks, laps, seams, cold shuts,  inclusions, splits, tears, pipes, and voids. All of these may  affect the reliability of parts in service.  

Cracks, splits, bursts, tears, seams, voids, and pipes are  formed by an actual parting or rupture of the solid metal.  Cold shuts and laps are folds that have been formed in the  metal, interrupting its continuity.  

Inclusions are foreign material formed by impurities in the  metal during the metal processing stages. They may consist,  for example, of bits of furnace lining picked up during the  melting of the basic metal or of other foreign constituents.  Inclusions interrupt the continuity of the metal, because they  

# Preparation of Parts for Testing  

Grease, oil, and dirt must be cleaned from all parts before  they are tested. Cleaning is very important since any grease  or other foreign material present can produce nonrelevant  indications due to magnetic particles adhering to the foreign  material as the suspension drains from the part.  

Grease or foreign material in sufficient amount over a  discontinuity may also prevent the formation of a pattern  at the discontinuity. It is not advisable to depend upon the  magnetic particle suspension to clean the part. Cleaning by  suspension is not thorough and any foreign materials so  removed from the part contaminates the suspension, thereby  reducing its effectiveness.  

In the dry procedure, thorough cleaning is absolutely  necessary. Grease or other foreign material holds the  magnetic powder, resulting in nonrelevant indications and  making it impossible to distribute the indicating medium  evenly over the part’s surface. All small openings and oil  holes leading to internal passages or cavities must be plugged  with paraffin or other suitable nonabrasive material.  

Coatings of cadmium, copper, tin, and zinc do not interfere  with the satisfactory performance of magnetic particle  inspection, unless the coatings are unusually heavy or the  discontinuities to be detected are unusually small.  

Chromium and nickel plating generally do not interfere with  indications of cracks open to the surface of the base metal, but  prevent indications of fine discontinuities, such as inclusions.  Because it is more strongly magnetic, nickel plating is more  effective than chromium plating in preventing the formation  of indications.  

# Effect of Flux Direction  

To locate a defect in a part, it is essential that the magnetic  lines of force pass approximately perpendicular to the defect.  It is, therefore, necessary to induce magnetic flux in more  than one direction, since defects are likely to exist at any  angle to the major axis of the part. This requires two separate  magnetizing operations, referred to as circular magnetization  and longitudinal magnetization. The effect of flux direction  is illustrated in  Figure 10-28.  

Circular magnetization is the induction of a magnetic field  consisting of concentric circles of force about and within  the part. This is achieved by passing electric current through  the part, locating defects running approximately parallel  to the axis of the part.  Figure 10-29  illustrates circular  magnetization of a crankshaft. In longitudinal magnetization,  the magnetic field is produced in a direction parallel to the  long axis of the part. This is accomplished by placing the part  in a solenoid excited by electric current. The metal part then  becomes the core of an electromagnet and is magnetized by  induction from the magnetic field created in the solenoid.  In longitudinal magnetization of long parts, the solenoid  must be moved along the part in order to magnetize it.  [Figure 10-30]  This is necessary to ensure adequate field  strength throughout the entire length of the part.  

Solenoids produce effective magnetization for approximately  12 inches from each end of the coil, thus accommodating parts  or sections approximately 30 inches in length. Longitudinal  magnetization equivalent to that obtained by a solenoid may  be accomplished by wrapping a flexible electrical conductor  around the part. Although this method is not as convenient,  it has an advantage in that the coils conform more closely to  the shape of the part, producing a somewhat more uniform  magnetization. The flexible coil method is also useful for  large or irregularly-shaped parts when standard solenoids  are not available.  

# Effect of Flux Density  

The effectiveness of the magnetic particle inspection also  depends on the flux density or field strength at the surface of the  part when the indicating medium is applied. As the flux density  in the part is increased, the sensitivity of the test increases,  because of the greater flux leakages at discontinuities and the  resulting improved formation of magnetic particle patterns.  

![](images/8ae9ddf70eaf8f60a47ddd71cacf7e39e13d905b7ab00a85252e5a619f254236.jpg)

Figure 10-27.   Flux leakage at longitudinal discontinuity.  

Excessively high flux densities may form nonrelevant  indications, such as patterns of the grain flow in the material.  These indications interfere with the detection of patterns  resulting from significant discontinuities. It is therefore  necessary to use a field strength high enough to reveal all  possible harmful discontinuities, but not strong enough to  produce confusing nonrelevant indications.  

# Magnetizing Methods  

When a part is magnetized, the field strength in the part  increases to a maximum for the particular magnetizing force  and remains at this maximum as long as the magnetizing  force is maintained.  

When the magnetizing force is removed, the field strength  decreases to a lower residual value depending on the magnetic  properties of the material and the shape of the part. These  magnetic characteristics determine whether the continuous  or residual method is used in magnetizing the part.  

In the continuous inspection method, the part is magnetized  and the indicating medium applied while the magnetizing  force is maintained. The available flux density in the part  is thus at a maximum. The maximum value of flux depends  directly upon the magnetizing force and the permeability of  the material that the part is made of.  

The continuous method may be used in practically all circular  and longitudinal magnetization procedures. The continuous  procedure provides greater sensitivity than the residual  procedure, particularly in locating subsurface discontinuities.  The highly critical nature of aircraft parts and assemblies and  the necessity for subsurface inspection in many applications  have resulted in the continuous method being more  widely used. Since the continuous procedure reveals more  nonsignificant discontinuities than the residual procedure,  careful and intelligent interpretation and evaluation of  discontinuities revealed by this procedure are necessary.  

The residual inspection procedure involves magnetization of  the part and application of the indicating medium after the  magnetizing force has been removed. This procedure relies on  the residual or permanent magnetism in the part and is more  practical than the continuous procedure when magnetization  is accomplished by flexible coils wrapped around the part. In  general, the residual procedure is used only with steels that  have been heat-treated for stressed applications.  

# Identification of Indications  

The correct evaluation of the character of indications is  extremely important but is sometimes difficult to make  from observation of the indications alone. The principal  distinguishing features of indications are shape, buildup,  width, and sharpness of outline. These characteristics  are more valuable in distinguishing between types of  discontinuities than in determining their severity. Careful  observation of the character of the magnetic particle pattern  

![](images/875694882239ef9a98c321b2dd51f4f9018c4a5cd071c7177743d6860e20b128.jpg)

Figure 10-28.   Effect of flux direction on strength of indication.  

must always be included in the complete evaluation of the  significance of an indicated discontinuity.  

The most readily distinguished indications are those produced  by cracks open to the surface. These discontinuities include  fatigue cracks, heat-treat cracks, shrink cracks in welds and  castings, and grinding cracks. An example of a fatigue crack  is shown in  Figure 10-31.  

# Magnaglo Inspection  

Magnaglo inspection is similar to the preceding method,  but differs in that a fluorescent particle solution is  used and the inspection is made under black light.  [Figure 10-32]  Efficiency of inspection is increased by the  neon-like glow of defects allowing smaller flaw indications  to be seen. This is an excellent method for use on gears,  threaded parts, and aircraft engine components. The reddish- brown liquid spray or bath that is used consists of Magnaglo  paste mixed with a light oil at the ratio of 0.10 to 0.25 ounce  of paste per gallon of oil. After inspection, the part must be  demagnetized and rinsed with a cleaning solvent.  

# Magnetizing Equipment  

Fixed (Nonportable) General Purpose Unit  A fixed, general  purpose unit provides direct current (DC) for wet, continuous,  or residual magnetization procedures.  [Figure 10-33] Circular or longitudinal magnetization may be used, and  it may be powered with rectified AC, as well as DC. The  contact heads provide the electrical terminals for circular  magnetization. One head is fixed in position with its contact  plate mounted on a shaft surrounded by a pressure spring  so that the plate may be moved longitudinally. The plate  is maintained in the extended position by the spring until  pressure transmitted through the work from the movable  head forces it back.  

![](images/d3698e546e4c40ba388da8c160892e27a95f0ec525b877a3688baea01186d61e.jpg)  
Figure 10-30.   Longitudinal magnetization of camshaft (solenoid  method).  

The motor-driven movable head slides horizontally in  longitudinal guides and is controlled by a switch. The spring  allows sufficient overrun of the motor-driven head to avoid  jamming it and also provides pressure on the ends of the  work to ensure good electrical contact.  

A plunger-operated switch in the fixed head cuts out the  forward motion circuit of the movable head motor when  the spring has been properly compressed. In some units,  the movable head is hand operated, and the contact plate is  sometimes arranged for operation by an air ram. Both contact  plates are fitted with various fixtures for supporting the work.  

The magnetizing circuit is closed by depressing a pushbutton  on the front of the unit. It is set to open automatically, usually  after about one-half second. The strength of the magnetizing  current may be set manually to the desired value by means  of the rheostat or increased to the capacity of the unit by  the rheostat short circuiting switch. The current utilized is  indicated on the ammeter. Longitudinal magnetization is  produced by the solenoid that moves in the same guide rail  as the movable head and is connected in the electrical circuit  by means of a switch.  

The suspension liquid is contained in a sump tank and is  agitated and circulated by a pump. The suspension is applied  to the work through a nozzle. The suspension drains from the  work through a nonmetallic grill into a collecting pan that  leads back to the sump. The circulating pump is operated by  a pushbutton switch.  

# Portable General Purpose Unit  

It is often necessary to perform the magnetic particle inspection  at locations where fixed general purpose equipment is not  available or to perform an inspection on members of aircraft  structures without removing them from the aircraft. It is  particularly useful for inspecting landing gear and engine  mounts suspected of having developed cracks in service.  Portable units supply both AC and DC magnetization.  

This unit is a source of magnetizing and demagnetizing  current but does not provide a means for supporting the work  or applying the suspension. It operates on 200 volt, 60 cycle  AC and contains a rectifier for producing DC when required.  [Figure 10-34]  

The magnetizing current is supplied through the flexible cables  with prods or contact clamps, as shown in  Figure 10-35 .  The cable terminals may be fitted with prods or with contact  clamps. Circular magnetization may be developed by using  either the prods or clamps.  

Longitudinal magnetization is developed by wrapping the  cable around the part. The strength of the magnetizing current  is controlled by an eight-point tap switch, and the duration  that it is applied is regulated by an automatic cutoff similar  to that used in the fixed general purpose unit.  

This portable unit also serves as a demagnetizer and  supplies high amperage, low-voltage AC for this purpose.  For demagnetization, the AC is passed through the part and  gradually reduced by means of a current reducer. In testing large structures with flat surfaces where current  must be passed through the part, it is sometimes impossible  to use contact clamps. In such cases, contact prods are used.  

Prods can be used with the fixed general purpose unit, as well  as the portable unit. The part or assembly being tested may  be held or secured above the standard unit and the suspension  hosed onto the area, while excess suspension drains into the  tank. The dry procedure may also be used.  

Prods are held firmly against the surface being tested. There  is a tendency for a high-amperage current to cause burning  at contact areas, but with proper care, such burning is  usually slight. For applications where prod magnetization is

acceptable, slight burning is normally acceptable.  

# Indicating Mediums  

The various types of indicating mediums available for  magnetic particle inspection may be divided into two general  material types: wet and dry. The basic requirement for any  indicating medium is that it produce acceptable indications  of discontinuities in parts.  

The contrast provided by a particular indicating medium on  the background or part surface is particularly important. The  colors most extensively used are black and red for the wet  procedure and black, red, and gray for the dry procedure.  

For acceptable operation, the indicating medium must be  of high permeability and low retentivity. High permeability  ensures that a minimum of magnetic energy is required to  attract the material to flux leakage caused by discontinuities.  Low retentivity ensures that the mobility of the magnetic  particles is not hindered by the particles themselves becoming  magnetized and attracting one another.  

# Demagnetizing  

The permanent magnetism remaining after inspection must  be removed by a demagnetization operation if the part is  to be returned to service. Parts of operating mechanisms  must be demagnetized to prevent magnetized parts from  attracting filings, grindings, or chips inadvertently left in the  system or steel particles resulting from operational wear. An  accumulation of such particles on a magnetized part may cause  scoring of bearings or other working parts. Parts of the airframe  must be demagnetized so they do not affect instruments.  

Demagnetization between successive magnetizing operations  

![](images/9c7a163061289c34470ab12ab1c2cf6982f92ec43e914c13d49173cef38391fd.jpg)  
Figure 10-33.   Fixed general-purpose magnetizing unit.  

is not normally required unless experience indicates that  omission of this operation results in decreased effectiveness  for a particular application. Demagnetization may be  accomplished in a number of different ways. A convenient  procedure for aircraft parts involves subjecting the part to a  magnetizing force that is continually reversing in direction  and, at the same time, gradually decreasing in strength.  As the decreasing magnetizing force is applied first in one  direction and then the other, the magnetization of the part  also decreases.  

# Standard Demagnetizing Practice  

The basic procedure for developing a reversing and gradually  decreasing magnetizing force in a part involves the use of a  solenoid coil energized by AC. As the part is moved away  from the alternating field of the solenoid, the magnetism in  the part gradually decreases.  

A demagnetizer whose size approximates that of the work  is used. For maximum effectiveness, small parts are held as  close to the inner wall of the coil as possible. Parts that do  not readily lose their magnetism are passed slowly in and  out of the demagnetizer several times and, at the same time,  tumbled or rotated in various directions. Allowing a part to  remain in the demagnetizer with the current on accomplishes  very little practical demagnetization.  

The effective operation in the demagnetizing procedure is  that of slowly moving the part out of the coil and away from  the magnetizing field strength. As the part is withdrawn, it is  kept directly opposite the opening until it is 1 or 2 feet from  the demagnetizer. The demagnetizing current is not cut off  until the part is 1 or 2 feet from the opening as the part may  be remagnetized if current is removed too soon. Another  procedure used with portable units is to pass AC through  the part being demagnetized, while gradually reducing the  current to zero.  

![](images/f69649d42c5c609714681f0b7116335741b5be1dd38db29e6e333b975d5fc3cf.jpg)  
Figure 10-34.   Portable magnetic particle inspection equipment.  

# Radiographic  

Because of their unique ability to penetrate material and  disclose discontinuities, X and gamma radiations have  been applied to the radiographic (x-ray) inspection of metal  fabrications and nonmetallic products.  

The penetrating radiation is projected through the part to be  inspected and produces an invisible or latent image in the film.  When processed, the film becomes a radiograph or shadow  picture of the object. This inspection medium and portable  unit provides a fast and reliable means for checking the  integrity of airframe structures and engines.  [Figure 10-36]  

# Radiographic Inspection  

Radiographic inspection techniques are used to locate  defects or flaws in airframe structures or engines with little  or no disassembly. This is in marked contrast to other types  of nondestructive testing that usually require removal,  disassembly, and stripping of paint from the suspected  part before it can be inspected. Due to the radiation risks  associated with x-ray, extensive training is required to become  a qualified radiographer. Only qualified radiographers are  allowed to operate the  $\mathbf{X}$  -ray units.  

Three major steps in the x-ray process discussed in subsequent  paragraphs are: exposure to radiation, including preparation;  processing of film; and interpretation of the radiograph.  

# Preparation and Exposure  

The factors of radiographic exposure are so interdependent  that it is necessary to consider all factors for any particular  radiographic exposure. These factors include, but are not  limited to, the following:  

•	 Material thickness and density •	 Shape and size of the object •	 Type of defect to be detected •	 Characteristics of x-ray machine used •	 The exposure distance •	 The exposure angle •	 Film characteristics •	 Types of intensifying screen, if used  

Knowledge of the x-ray unit’s capabilities form a background  for the other exposure factors. In addition to the unit rating  in kilovoltage, the size, portability, ease of manipulation,  and exposure particulars of the available equipment must  be thoroughly understood. Previous experience on similar  objects is also very helpful in the determination of the overall  exposure techniques. A log or record of previous exposures  provides specific data as a guide for future radiographs. After  

![](images/75d2ae9914e77abdd603cde9c7685d50cffc5346a97f368e659e9c295b298347.jpg)  
Figure 10-35.   Magnetic particle inspection accessories.  

exposure to x-rays, the latent image on the film is made  permanently visible by processing it successively through a  developer chemical solution, an acid bath, and a fixing bath,  followed by a clear water wash.  

# Radiographic Interpretation  

From the standpoint of quality assurance, radiographic  interpretation is the most important phase of radiography.  It is during this phase that an error in judgment can  produce disastrous consequences. The efforts of the whole  radiographic process are centered in this phase, where the  part or structure is either accepted or rejected. Conditions  of unsoundness or other defects that are overlooked, not  understood, or improperly interpreted can destroy the purpose  and efforts of radiography and can jeopardize the structural  integrity of an entire aircraft. A particular danger is the false  sense of security imparted by the acceptance of a part or  structure based on improper interpretation.  

As a first impression, radiographic interpretation may seem  simple, but a closer analysis of the problem soon dispels this  impression. The subject of interpretation is so varied and  complex that it cannot be covered adequately in this type of  document. Instead, this chapter gives only a brief review of  basic requirements for radiographic interpretation, including  some descriptions of common defects.  

Experience has shown that, whenever possible, it is  important to conduct radiographic interpretation close to  the radiographic operation. When viewing radiographs, it  is helpful to have access to the material being tested. The  radiograph can thus be compared directly with the material  being tested, and indications due to such things as surface  condition or thickness variations can be immediately  determined. The following paragraphs present several factors  that must be considered when analyzing a radiograph.  

There are three basic categories of flaws: voids, inclusions,  and dimensional irregularities. The last category, dimensional  irregularities, is not pertinent to these discussions, because its  prime factor is one of degree and radiography is not exact.  Voids and inclusions may appear on the radiograph in a  variety of forms ranging from a two-dimensional plane to  a three-dimensional sphere. A crack, tear, or cold shut most  nearly resembles a two-dimensional plane, whereas a cavity  looks like a three-dimensional sphere. Other types of flaws,  such as shrink, oxide inclusions, porosity, and so forth, fall  somewhere between these two extremes of form.  

It is important to analyze the geometry of a flaw, especially for  items such as the sharpness of terminal points. For example,  in a crack-like flaw, the terminal points appear much sharper  in a sphere-like flaw, such as a gas cavity. Also, material  strength may be adversely affected by flaw shape. A flaw  having sharp points could establish a source of localized stress  concentration. Spherical flaws affect material strength to a far  lesser degree than do sharp-pointed flaws. Specifications and  reference standards usually stipulate that sharp-pointed flaws,  such as cracks, cold shuts, and so forth, are cause for rejection.  

Material strength is also affected by flaw size. A metallic  component of a given area is designed to carry a certain load  plus a safety factor. Reducing this area by including a large  flaw weakens the part and reduces the safety factor. Some  flaws are often permitted in components due to these safety  factors. In this case, the interpreter must determine the degree  

![](images/fdb68fced4e343f5102166d59be3eb01ebccf4eac3add58a13ee3705a4f42952.jpg)  
Figure 10-36.   Radiograph.  

of tolerance or imperfection specified by the design engineer.  Both flaw size and flaw shape are considered carefully, since  small flaws with sharp points can be just as bad as large flaws  with no sharp points.  

Another important consideration in flaw analysis is flaw  location. Metallic components are subjected to numerous and  varied forces during their effective service life. Generally, the  distribution of these forces is not equal in the component or  part, and certain critical areas may be rather highly stressed.  The interpreter must pay special attention to these areas.  Another aspect of flaw location is that certain types of  discontinuities close to one another may potentially serve  as a source of stress concentrations creating a situation that  must be closely scrutinized.  

An inclusion is a type of flaw that contains entrapped  material. Such flaws may be of greater or lesser density than  the item being radiographed. The foregoing discussions on  flaw shape, size, and location apply equally to inclusions  and to voids. In addition, a flaw containing foreign material  could become a source of corrosion.  

# Radiation Hazards  

Radiation from x-ray units and radioisotope sources is  destructive to living tissue. It is universally recognized that  in the use of such equipment, adequate protection must be  provided. Personnel must keep outside the primary x-ray  beam at all times.  

Radiation produces change in all matter that it passes through.  This is also true of living tissue. When radiation strikes the  molecules of the body, the effect may be no more than to  dislodge a few electrons, but an excess of these changes  could cause irreparable harm. When a complex organism is  exposed to radiation, the degree of damage, if any, depends  on the body cells that have been changed.  

Vital organs in the center of the body that are penetrated by  radiation are likely to be harmed the most. The skin usually  absorbs most of the radiation and reacts earliest to radiation.  

If the whole body is exposed to a very large dose of radiation,  death could result. In general, the type and severity of the  pathological effects of radiation depend on the amount of  radiation received at one time and the percentage of the  total body exposed. Smaller doses of radiation could cause  blood and intestinal disorders in a short period of time.  The more delayed effects are leukemia and other cancers.  Skin damage and loss of hair are also possible results of  exposure to radiation.  

# Inspection of Composites  

Composite structures are inspected for delamination  (separation of the various plies), debonding of the skin from  the core, and evidence of moisture and corrosion. Previously  discussed methods including ultrasonic, acoustic emission,  and radiographic inspections may be used as recommended  by the aircraft manufacturer. The simplest method used in  testing composite structures is the tap test. Newer methods,  such as thermography, have been developed to inspect  composite structures.  

# Tap Testing  

Tap testing, also referred to as the ring test or coin test, is  widely used as a quick evaluation of any accessible surface  to detect the presence of delamination or debonding. The  testing procedure consists of lightly tapping the surface with a  light weight hammer (maximum weight of 2 ounces), a coin,  or other suitable device. The acoustic response or “ring” is  compared to that of a known good area. A “flat” or “dead”  response indicates an area of concern. Tap testing is limited  to finding defects in relatively thin skins, less than   $0.080"$  thick. On honeycomb structures, both sides need to be tested.  Tap testing on one side alone would not detect debonding on  the opposite side.  [Figure 10-37]  

# Electrical Conductivity  

Composite structures are not inherently electrically  conductive. Some aircraft, because of their relatively low  speed and type of use, are not affected by electrical issues.  Manufacturers of other aircraft, such as high-speed, high- performance jets, are required to utilize various methods of  incorporating aluminum or copper into their structures to  make them conductive. The aluminum or copper (aluminum  is used with fiberglass and Kevlar, while copper is used with  carbon fiber) is imbedded within the plies of the lay-ups either  as a thin wire mesh, screen, foil, or spray. When damaged  sections of the structure are repaired, care must be taken to  ensure that the conductive path be restored. Not only is it  necessary to include the conductive material in the repair,  but the continuity of the electrical path from the original  conductive material to the replacement conductor and back to  the original must be maintained. Electrical conductivity may  be checked by use of an ohmmeter. Specific manufacturer’s  instructions must be carefully followed.  

# Thermography  

Thermography is an NDI technique often used with thin  composite structures that use radiant electromagnetic thermal  energy to detect flaws. Most common sources of heat are  heat lamps or heater blankets. The basic principle of thermal  inspection consists of measuring or mapping of surface  temperatures when heat flows from, to, or through a test  object. All thermographic techniques rely on differentials in  thermal conductivity between normal, defect-free areas and  those having a defect. Normally, a heat source is used to  elevate the temperature of the article being examined while  observing the surface heating effects. Because defect-free  areas conduct heat more efficiently than areas with defects,  the amount of heat that is either absorbed or reflected  indicates the quality of the bond. The type of defects that  affect the thermal properties include disbonds, cracks, impact  damage, panel thinning, and water ingress into composite  materials and honeycomb core. Thermal methods are most  effective for thin laminates or for defects near the surface.  

The most widely used thermographic inspection technique  uses an infrared (IR) sensing system to measure temperature  distribution. This type of inspection can provide rapid,  one-sided, non-contact scanning of surfaces, components,  or assemblies. The heat source can be as simple as a heat  lamp, so long as the appropriate heat energy is applied to  the inspection surface. The induced temperature rise is  a few degrees and dissipates quickly after the heat input  is removed. The IR camera records the IR patterns. The  resulting temperature data is processed to provide more  quantitative information. An operator analyzes the screen  and determines whether a defect was found. Because IR  thermography is a radiometric measurement, it can be  done without physical contact. Depending on the spatial  resolution of the IR camera and the size of the expected  damage, each image can be of a relatively large area.  Furthermore, as composite materials do not radiate heat  nearly as much as aluminum and have higher emissivity,  thermography can provide better definition of damage  with smaller heat inputs. Understanding of structural  arrangement is imperative to ensure that substructure is not

# Inspection of Welds  

A discussion of welds in this chapter is confined to judging  the quality of completed welds by visual means. Although the  appearance of the completed weld is not a positive indication  of quality, it provides a good clue about the care used in  making it. A properly designed joint weld is stronger than  the base metal that it joins. The characteristics of a properly  welded joint are discussed in the following paragraphs.  

A good weld is uniform in width; the ripples are even and  well feathered into the base metal and show no burn due to  overheating.  [Figure 10-38]  The weld has good penetration  and is free of gas pockets, porosity, or inclusions. The edges  of the bead are not in a straight line, yet the weld is good  since penetration is excellent.  

Penetration is the depth of fusion in a weld. Thorough fusion  is the most important characteristic contributing to a sound  weld. Penetration is affected by the thickness of the material  to be joined, the size of the filler rod, and how it is added.  In a butt weld, the penetration should be 100 percent of the  thickness of the base metal. On a fillet weld, the penetration  requirements are 25 to 50 percent of the thickness of the base  metal. The width and depth of bead for a butt weld and fillet  weld are shown in  Figure 10-39.  

The weld in  Figure 10-38A  was made too rapidly. The long  and pointed appearance of the ripples was caused by an  excessive amount of heat or an oxidizing flame. If the weld  were cross-sectioned, it would probably disclose gas pockets,  porosity, and slag inclusions.  

Figure 10-38B  illustrates a weld that has improper penetration  and cold laps caused by insufficient heat. It appears rough and  irregular, and its edges are not feathered into the base metal. The puddle tends to boil during the welding operation if an  excessive amount of acetylene is used. This often leaves slight  bumps along the center and craters at the finish of the weld.  Cross-checks are apparent if the body of the weld is sound.  If the weld were cross-sectioned, pockets and porosity are  visible.  [Figure 10-38C]  

A bad weld has irregular edges and considerable variation  in the depth of penetration. It often has the appearance of a  cold weld.  

To assist further in determining the quality of a welded joint,  several examples of incorrect welds are discussed in the  following paragraphs.  

![](images/0ebfe162d56d4919a677c4d2d5ec50f41e7c0e4bd398583333cc96903b192c90.jpg)

# Chapter 11 Hand Tools & Measuring Devices  

The aviation maintenance technician (AMT) spends a major  portion of each day using a wide variety of hand tools to  accomplish maintenance tasks. This chapter contains an  overview of some of the hand tools an AMT can expect to use.  An AMT encounters many special tools as their experience  widens. For example, large transport category aircraft have  different maintenance tasks from those of a light airplane,  and special hand tools are often required when working on  complex aircraft.  

This chapter outlines the basic knowledge required  when using the most common hand tools and measuring  instruments used in aircraft repair work. This information,  however, cannot replace sound judgment on the part of the  individual, nor additional training as the need arises. There  are many times when ingenuity and resourcefulness can  supplement these basic rules. Sound knowledge is required  of these basic rules and of the situations in which they apply.  The use of tools may vary, but good practices for safety, care,  and storage of tools remain the same.  

# General Purpose Tools  

# Hammers & Mallets  

Figure 11-1  shows some of the hammers that the aviation  mechanic may be required to use. Metal head hammers  are usually sized according to the weight of the head alone  without the handle.  

Occasionally, it is necessary to use a soft-faced hammer,  which has a striking surface made of wood, brass, lead,  rawhide, hard rubber, or plastic. These hammers are intended  for use in forming soft metals and striking surfaces that are  easily damaged. Soft-faced hammers should not be used  for striking punch heads, bolts, or nails, as using one in this  fashion quickly ruins this type of hammer.  

A mallet is a hammer-like tool with a head made of hickory,  rawhide, or rubber. It is handy for shaping thin metal parts  without causing creases or dents with abrupt corners. Always  use a wooden mallet when pounding a wood chisel or a gouge.  

When using a hammer or mallet, choose the one best suited  for the job. Ensure that the handle is tight. When striking a  blow with the hammer, use the forearm as an extension of  the handle. Swing the hammer by bending the elbow, not the  wrist. Always strike the work squarely with the full face of  the hammer. When striking a metal tool with a metal hammer,  the use of safety glasses or goggles is strongly encouraged.  Always keep the faces of hammers and mallets smooth and free  from dents, chips, or gouges to prevent marring of the work.  

# Screwdrivers  

The screwdriver can be classified by its shape, type of blade,  and blade length. [ Figure 11-2]  It is made for only one purpose,  loosening or tightening screws or screw head bolts. When using  the common screwdriver, select the largest screwdriver whose  blade makes a good fit in the screw that needs to be turned.  

A common screwdriver must fill at least 75 percent of the  screw slot. If the screwdriver is the wrong size, it cuts and  burrs the screw slot, making it unusable. The damage may be  so severe that the use of a screw extractor may be required. A  screwdriver with the wrong size blade may slip and damage  adjacent parts of the structure as well.  

The common screwdriver is used only where slotted head  screws or fasteners are found on aircraft. An example of a  fastener that requires the use of a common screwdriver is  the camlock style fastener that is used to secure the cowling  on some aircraft.  

The two types of recessed head screws for common use are  the Phillips and the Reed & Prince. Both the Phillips and  Reed & Prince recessed heads are optional on several types  of screws. As shown in  Figure 11-2 , the Reed & Prince  recessed head forms a perfect cross. The screwdriver used  with this screw is pointed on the end. Since the Phillips  screw has a slightly larger center in the cross, the Phillips  screwdriver is blunt on the end. The Phillips screwdriver  is not interchangeable with the Reed & Prince. The use of  the wrong type of screwdriver results in mutilation of the  screwdriver and the screw head. When turning a recessed  head screw, use only the proper recessed head screwdriver of  the correct size. The most common crosspoint screwdrivers  are the Number 1 and Number 2 Phillips. Each of these are  designed to be used for specific sized screws. A Number 1  Phillips screwdriver is used on 2, 3, and 4 screws, while a  Number 2 Phillips is used for screw sizes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  

An offset screwdriver may be used when vertical space  is limited. Offset screwdrivers are constructed with both  ends bent  $90^{\circ}$   to the shank handle. By using alternate ends,  most screws can be seated or loosened even when the  swinging space is limited. Offset screwdrivers are made for  both standard and recessed head screws. Ratcheting right  angle screwdrivers are also available and often prove to be  indispensable when working in close quarters.  

A screwdriver should not be used for chiseling or prying.  Do not use a screwdriver to check an electric circuit since  an electric arc will burn the tip and make it ineffective. In  some cases, an electric arc may fuse the blade to the unit  being checked, creating a short circuit.  

When using a screwdriver on a small part, always hold the  part in the vise or rest it on a workbench. Do not hold the part  in the hand, as the screwdriver may slip and cause serious  personal injury.  

Replaceable tip screwdrivers, commonly referred to as  “10 in 1” screwdrivers, allow for the quick changing of a  screwdriver tip and economical replacement of the tip when it  becomes worn. A wide variety of screwdriver tips, including  flat, crosspoint (Reed & Prince, Phillips), Torx (6-point star- shaped pattern), and square drive tips are available for use  with the handles.  [Figure 11-3]  

The cordless hand-held power screwdriver has replaced most  automatic or spiral screwdrivers for the removal of multiple  screws from an airframe. Care must be exercised when using  a power screwdriver. If the slip clutch is set for too high a  setting when installing a screw, the screwdriver tip will slip  and rotate on top of the screw head, damaging it. The screw  should be started by hand to avoid driving the screw into  the nut or nut plate in a cross-threaded manner. To avoid  damaging the slot or receptacle in the head of the screw, the  use of cordless power drills fitted with a removable tip driver  to remove or install screws is not recommended, as the drill  does not have a slip-clutch installed.

# Pliers & Plier-Type Cutting Tools  

As shown in  Figure 11-4 , the pliers used most frequently  in aircraft repair work are the diagonal, needle-nose, and  duckbill. The size of pliers indicates their overall length,  usually ranging from 5 to 12 inches.  

Roundnose pliers are used to crimp metal. They are not made  for heavy work because too much pressure springs the jaws,  which are often wrapped to prevent scarring the metal.  

Needle-nose pliers have half round jaws of varying lengths.  They are used to hold objects and make adjustments in  tight places.  

Duckbill pliers resemble a “duck’s bill” in that the jaws are  thin, flat, and have the shape of a duck’s bill. They are used  exclusively for twisting safety wire.  

Diagonal pliers are usually referred to as diagonals or  “dikes.” The diagonal is a short-jawed cutter with a blade  set at a slight angle on each jaw. This tool can be used to  cut wire, rivets, small screws, and cotter pins, besides being  practically indispensable in removing or installing safety  wire. The duckbill pliers and the diagonal cutting pliers are  used extensively in aviation for the job of safety wiring. Two important rules for using pliers:  

1.	 Do not make pliers work beyond their capacity. The  long-nosed variety is especially delicate. It is easy to  spring or break them or nick the edges. If this occurs,  they are practically useless. 2.	 Do not use pliers to turn nuts. In just a few seconds,  a pair of pliers can damage a nut more than years  of service.  

# Punches  

Punches are used to locate centers for drawing circles, to start  holes for drilling, to punch holes in sheet metal, to transfer  location of holes in patterns, and to remove damaged rivets,  pins, or bolts.  

Solid or hollow punches are the two types generally used.  Solid punches are classified according to the shape of their  points.  Figure 11-5  shows several types of punches.  

Prick punches are used to place reference marks on metal.  This punch is often used to transfer dimensions from a paper  pattern directly on the metal. To do this, first place the paper  pattern directly on the metal. Then go over the outline of the  pattern with the prick punch, tapping it lightly with a small  hammer and making slight indentations on the metal at the  major points on the drawing. These indentations can then  be used as reference marks for cutting the metal. A prick  punch should never be struck a heavy blow with a hammer  because it may bend the punch or cause excessive damage  to the material being worked.  

Large indentations in metal, which are necessary to start a  twist drill, are made with a center punch. It should never be  struck with enough force to dimple the material around the  indentation or to cause the metal to protrude through the other  side of the sheet. A center punch has a heavier body than a  prick punch and is ground to a point with an angle of about  $60^{\circ}$  .  

The drive punch, which is often called a tapered punch, is used  for driving out damaged rivets, pins, and bolts that sometimes  bind in holes. The drive punch is therefore made with a flat  face instead of a point. The size of the punch is determined  by the width of the face, which is usually  $\%$   inch to  $\%$   inch.  

Pin punches, often called drift punches, are similar to drive  punches and are used for the same purposes. The difference  between the two is that the sides of a drive punch taper all  the way to the face while the pin punch has a straight shank.  Pin punches are sized by the diameter of the face, in thirty- seconds of an inch, and range from  $\%$   to  $\%$   inch in diameter.  

In general practice, a pin or bolt that is to be driven out is  usually started and driven with a drive punch until the sides  of the punch touch the side of the hole. A pin punch is then  used to drive the pin or bolt the rest of the way out of the  hole. Stubborn pins may be started by placing a thin piece of  scrap copper, brass, or aluminum directly against the pin and  then striking it with a hammer until the pin begins to move.  

Never use a prick punch or center punch to remove objects  from holes because the point of the punch spreads the object  and causes it to bind even more.  

The transfer punch is usually about 4 inches long. It has a  point that tapers and then turns straight for a short distance  in order to fit a drill locating hole in a template. The tip has  a point similar to that of a prick punch. As its name implies,  the transfer punch is used to transfer the location of holes  through the template or pattern to the material.

# Wrenches  

The wrenches most often used in aircraft maintenance are  classified as open-end, box-end, socket, adjustable, ratcheting  and special wrenches. The Allen wrench, although seldom  used, is required on one special type of recessed screw. One  of the most widely used metals for making wrenches is  chrome-vanadium steel. Wrenches made of this metal are  almost indestructible. Solid, nonadjustable wrenches with  open parallel jaws on one or both ends are known as open-end  wrenches. These wrenches may have their jaws parallel to  the handle or at an angle up to  $90°$  ; most are set at an angle  of   $15^{\circ}$  . The wrenches are designed to fit a nut, bolt head, or  other object, which makes it possible to exert a turning action.  

Box-end wrenches are popular tools because of their  usefulness in close quarters. They are called box wrenches  since they box, or completely surround, the nut or bolt head.  Practically all well-manufactured box-end wrenches are  made with 12 points so they can be used in places having as  little as  $15^{\circ}$   swing. In  Figure 11-6 , point A on the illustrated  double-broached hexagon wrench is nearer the centerline of  the head and the wrench handle than point B and also the  centerline of nut C. If the wrench is inverted and installed  

![](images/e18ba9cba63661470e36373e459ade9f10be080c9dd70261aecfe2943d7cbfcd.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.   Punches.  

on nut C, point A will be centered over side “Y” instead of  side “X.” The centerline of the handle will now be in the  dotted line position. It is by reversing (turning the wrench  over) the position of the wrench that a  $15^{\circ}$   arc may be made  with the wrench handle.  

Although box-end wrenches are ideal to break loose tight  nuts or pull tight nuts tighter, time is lost turning the nut off  the bolt once the nut is broken loose. Only when there is  sufficient clearance to rotate the wrench in a complete circle  can this tedious process be avoided.  

After a tight nut is broken loose, it can be completely backed  off or unscrewed more quickly with an open-end than with a  box-end wrench. In this case, a combination wrench can be  used. A combination wrench has a box end on one end and  an open-end wrench of the same size on the other.  

Another option for removing a nut from a bolt is the  ratcheting box-end wrench, which can be swung back and  forth to remove the nut or bolt. The box-end, combination,  and ratcheting wrenches are shown in  Figure 11-7 .  

A socket wrench is made of two parts: the socket, which is  placed over the top of a nut or bolt head; and a handle, which  is attached to the socket. Many types of handles, extensions,  and attachments are available to make it possible to use socket  wrenches in almost any location or position. Sockets are made  with either fixed or detachable handles. Socket wrenches  with fixed handles are usually furnished as an accessory to a  machine. They have a four, six, or twelve-sided recess to fit  a nut or bolt head that needs regular adjustment. Sockets  with detachable handles usually come in sets and fit several  types of handles, such as the T, ratchet, screwdriver grip, and  speed handle. Socket wrench handles have a square lug on  one end that fits into a square recess in the socket head. The  two parts are held together by a light, spring-loaded poppet.  Two types of sockets, a set of handles, and an extension bar  are shown in  Figure 11-8 .  

The adjustable wrench is a handy utility tool that has smooth  jaws and is designed as an open-end wrench. One jaw is  fixed, but the other may be moved by a thumbscrew or spiral  screwworm adjustment in the handle. The width of the jaws  may be varied from 0 to  $\%$   inch or more. The angle of the  opening to the handle is  $22\%$   degrees on an adjustable wrench.  One adjustable wrench does the work of several open-end  wrenches. Although versatile, they are not intended to replace  the standard open-end, box-end, or socket wrenches. When  using any adjustable wrench, always exert the pull on the  side of the handle attached to the fixed jaw of the wrench.  To minimize the possibility or rounding off the fastener, use  care to fit the wrench to the bolt or nut to be turned.  

# Special Wrenches  

The category of special wrenches includes the crowfoot,  flare nut, spanner, torque, and Allen wrenches.  [Figure 11-9  and  11-10]  

The crowfoot wrench is normally used when accessing nuts  that must be removed from studs or bolts that cannot be  accessed using other tools.  

The flare nut wrench has the appearance of a box-end wrench  that has been cut open on one end. This opening allows the  wrench to be used on the B-nut of a fuel, hydraulic, or oxygen  line. Since it mounts using the standard square adapter, like  the crowfoot wrench, it can be used in conjunction with a  

![](images/7bc4e7d77914a4fd38a7a7cf3fe8f4fee69a83287e2b57ef9e0006c0c9ddd7a8.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.   Box-end wrench use.  

torque wrench.  

The hook spanner is for a round nut with a series of notches  cut in the outer edge. This wrench has a curved arm with a  hook on the end that fits into one of the notches on the nut.  The hook is placed in one of these notches with the handle  pointing in the direction the nut is to be turned.  

Some hook spanner wrenches are adjustable and fit nuts of  various diameters. U-shaped hook spanners have two lugs  on the face of the wrench to fit notches cut in the face of the  nut or screw plug. End spanners resemble a socket wrench,  but have a series of lugs that fit into corresponding notches  in a nut or plug. Pin spanners have a pin in place of a lug, and  the pin fits into a round hole in the edge of a nut. Face pin  spanners are similar to the U-shaped hook spanners except  that they have pins instead of lugs.  

Most headless setscrews are the hex-head Allen type and  must be installed and removed with an Allen wrench. Allen  wrenches are six-sided bars in the shape of an L, or they can  be hex-shaped bars mounted in adapters for use with hand  ratchets. They range in size from  $\%_{4}$   to  $\%$   inch and fit into a  hexagonal recess in the setscrew.  

# Torque Wrench  

There are times when definite pressure must be applied to a  nut or bolt as it is installed. In such cases, a torque wrench  must be used. The torque wrench is a precision tool consisting  of a torque indicating handle and appropriate adapter or  attachments. It measures the amount of turning or twisting  force applied to a nut, bolt, or screw.  

![](images/81cf4bdfa1489e32017ab4a770570e040f74f4e874797878db096dceb9c8ef73.jpg)  
Figure 11-7.   Ratcheting, box-end, and combination wrenches.  

Before each use, the torque wrench should be visually  inspected for damage. If a bent pointer, cracked or broken  glass (dial type), or signs of rough handling are found, the  wrench must be tested. Torque wrenches must be tested at  periodic intervals to ensure accuracy.  

Calibrating a torque wrench is the process in which the  manufacturers of the torque wrench set ensure a precise  torque occurs on a standard and consistent basis. Regular  torque wrench calibration ensures repeatable accuracy and  adherence to standards. A torque wrench is a precision  tool and should be treated and maintained like a delicate  measuring instrument. A torque wrench must be properly  calibrated and maintained on a preventative maintenance  and calibration schedule.  In order to maintain accuracy,  it is crucial that a torque wrench and other measuring  equipment be calibrated regularly. Some wrenches or tools  may recommend six (6) month calibration intervals, while  others may schedule it at twelve (12) months.  

The three most commonly used torque wrenches are the  deflecting beam, dial indicating, and micrometer setting types.  [Figure 11-10]  When using the deflecting beam and the dial  indicating torque wrenches, the torque is read visually on a dial  or scale mounted on the handle of the wrench. The micrometer  setting torque wrench is preset to the desired torque. When  this torque is reached, the operator notices a sharp impulse  or breakaway “click.” For additional information on the  installation of fasteners requiring the use of a torque wrench,  refer to “Installation of Nuts, Washers, and Bolts” located in  Chapter 7, Aircraft Materials, Processes and Hardware.  

# Strap Wrenches  

The strap wrench can prove to be an invaluable tool for the  AMT. By their very nature, aircraft components, such as  tubing, pipes, small fittings, and round or irregularly-shaped  components, are built to be as light as possible while still  retaining enough strength to function properly. The misuse of  pliers or other gripping tools can quickly damage these parts.  If it is necessary to grip a part to hold it in place, or to rotate it  to facilitate removal, consider using a strap wrench that uses  a plastic covered fabric strap to grip the part.  [Figure 11-11]  

# Impact Drivers  

In certain applications, the use of an impact driver may be  required. Struck with a mallet, the impact driver uses cam  action to impart a high amount of torque in a sharp impact  to break loose a stubborn fastener. The drive portion of the  impact driver can accept a number of different drive bits  

![](images/7aa830d68e7c7638e0428a38d6473e87e12d7d5183b2abcc32fb341f3594ae84.jpg)

There are several kinds of hand snips, each of which serves  a different purpose. Straight, curved, hawksbill, and aviation  snips are in common use. Straight snips are used for cutting  straight lines when the distance is not great enough to use a  squaring shear and for cutting the outside of a curve. The other  types are used for cutting the inside of curves or radii. Snips  should never be used to cut heavy sheet metal.  [Figure 11-13]  

Aviation snips are designed especially for cutting heat-treated  aluminum alloy and stainless steel. They are also adaptable  for enlarging small holes. The blades have small teeth on the  cutting edges and are shaped for cutting very small circles and  irregular outlines. The handles are the compound leverage  type, making it possible to cut material as thick as 0.051  inch. Aviation snips are available in two types: those which  cut from right to left and those which cut from left to right.  

Unlike the hacksaw, snips do not remove any material when  the cut is made, but minute fractures often occur along the  cut. Therefore, cuts should be made about  $\%_{32}$   inch from the  layout line and finished by hand filing down to the line.  

# Hacksaws  

The common hacksaw has a blade, a frame, and a handle.  The handle can be obtained in two styles: pistol grip and  straight.  [Figure 11-14]  

Hacksaw blades have holes in both ends; they are mounted  on pins attached to the frame. When installing a blade in  a hacksaw frame, mount the blade with the teeth pointing  forward, away from the handle.  

Blades are made of high-grade tool steel or tungsten steel  and are available in sizes from 6 to 16 inches in length. The  10-inch blade is most commonly used. There are two types:  the all-hard blade and the flexible blade. In flexible blades,  only the teeth are hardened.  

Selection of the best blade for the job involves finding the  right type and pitch. An all-hard blade is best for sawing  brass, tool steel, cast iron, and heavy cross-section materials.  A flexible blade is usually best for sawing hollow shapes and  metals having a thin cross-section.  

The pitch of a blade indicates the number of teeth per inch.  Pitches of 14, 18, 24, and 32 teeth per inch are available. A  blade with 14 teeth per inch is preferred when cutting machine  steel, cold-rolled steel, or structural steel. A blade with 18  teeth per inch is preferred for solid stock aluminum, bearing  metal, tool steel, and cast iron. Use a blade with 24 teeth per  inch when cutting thick-walled tubing, pipe, brass, copper,  channel, and angle iron. Use the 32 teeth per inch blade for  cutting thin-walled tubing and sheet metal. When using a  hacksaw, observe the following procedures:  

1.	 Select an appropriate saw blade for the job.  

2.	 Assemble the blade in the frame so that the cutting  edge of the teeth points away from the handle. 3.	 Adjust tension of the blade in the frame to prevent the  saw from buckling and drifting. 4.	 Clamp the work in the vise in such a way that provides  as much bearing surface as possible and engages the  greatest number of teeth. 5.	 Indicate the starting point by nicking the surface with  the edge of a file to break any sharp corner that might  strip the teeth. This mark also aids in starting the saw  at the proper place. 6.	 Hold the saw at an angle that keeps at least two teeth  in contact with the work at all times. Start the cut with  a light, steady, forward stroke just outside the cutting  line. At the end of the stroke, relieve the pressure and  draw the blade back. (The cut is made only on the  forward stroke.) 7.	 After the first few strokes, make each stroke as long  as the hacksaw frame allows. This prevents the blade  from overheating. Apply just enough pressure on the

forward stroke to cause each tooth to remove a small  amount of metal. The strokes should be long and  steady with a speed not more than 40 to 50 strokes  per minute.  

8.	 After completing the cut, remove chips from the blade,  loosen tension on the blade, and return the hacksaw  to its proper place.  

# Chisels  

A chisel is a hard steel cutting tool that can be used for cutting  and chipping any metal softer than the chisel itself. It can be  used in restricted areas and for such work as shearing rivets,  or splitting seized or damaged nuts from bolts.  [Figure 11-15]  

The size of a flat cold chisel is determined by the width of  the cutting edge. Lengths vary, but chisels are seldom under  5 inches or over 8 inches long.  

![](images/58710dfc7955a78cb89128752c843dcd8f985f74a7cd0c9bda3dd143138e6974.jpg)  
Figure 11-14.   Hacksaws.  

Chisels are usually made of eight-sided tool steel bar stock,  carefully hardened and tempered. Since the cutting edge  is slightly convex, the center portion receives the greatest  shock when cutting, and the weaker corners are protected.  The cutting angle should be  $60^{\circ}$   to   $70^{\circ}$   for general use, such  as for cutting wire, strap iron, or small bars and rods. When  using a chisel, hold it firmly in one hand. With the other  hand, strike the chisel head squarely with a ball peen hammer.  

When cutting square corners or slots, a special cold chisel  called a cape chisel should be used. It is like a flat chisel except  the cutting edge is very narrow. It has the same cutting angle  and is held and used in the same manner as any other chisel.  

Rounded or semicircular grooves and corners that have  fillets should be cut with a roundnose chisel. This chisel is  also used to re-center a drill that has moved away from its  intended center.  

The diamond point chisel is tapered square at the cutting end,  and then ground at an angle to provide the sharp diamond  point. It is used for cutting B-grooves and inside sharp angles.  

# Files  

Most files are made of high-grade tool steels that are hardened  and tempered. Files are manufactured in a variety of shapes  and sizes. They are known either by the cross section, the  general shape, or by their particular use. The cuts of files  must be considered when selecting them for various types  of work and materials.  

Files are used to square ends, file rounded corners, remove  burrs and slivers from metal, straighten uneven edges, smooth  rough edges, and file holes and slots.  

1.	 Their length, measured exclusive of the tang  [Figure 11-16] ;  2.	 Their kind or name, such as a hand file shown in  Figure 11-16 , that has reference to the relative  coarseness of the teeth; and  3.	 Their cut, such as a single- or double-cut file.  

Files are usually made in two types of cuts: single cut and  double cut. The single cut file has a single row of teeth  extending across the face at an angle of   $65^{\circ}$   to   $85^{\circ}$   with  the length of the file. The size of the cuts depends on the  coarseness of the file. The double cut file has two rows of  teeth that cross each other. For general work, the angle of  the first row is  $40^{\circ}$   to  $45^{\circ}$  . The first row is generally referred  to as “overcut,” and the second row as “upcut;” the upcut is  

# Care and Use  

Files and rasps are catalogued in three ways:  

•	 Length—Measuring from the tip to the heel of the file.  The tang is never included in the length. •	 Shape—Refers to the physical configuration of the  file (circular, rectangular, triangular, or a variation  thereof). •	 Cut—Refers to both the character of the teeth or the  coarseness—rough, coarse, and bastard for use on  heavier classes of work and second cut, smooth, and  dead smooth for finishing work.  

# Most Commonly Used Files  

# Hand Files  

These are parallel in width and tapered in thickness. They  have one safe edge (smooth edge) that permits filing in  corners and on other work where a safe edge is required.  Hand files are double cut and used principally for finishing  flat surfaces and similar work.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Flat Files  

These files are slightly tapered toward the point in both width  and thickness. They cut on both edges, as well as on the sides.  They are the most common files in use. Flat files are double  cut on both sides and single cut on both edges.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Mill Files  

These are usually tapered slightly in thickness and in width  for about one-third of their length. The teeth are ordinarily  single cut. These files are used for draw filing and to some  extent for filing soft metals.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Square Files  

These files may be tapered or blunt and are double cut. They  are used principally for filing slots and key seats and for  surface filing.  [Figure 11-17]  

Round or Rattail Files  

These are circular in cross section and may be either tapered  or blunt and single or double cut. They are used principally for  filing circular openings or concave surfaces.  [Figure 11-17]  

Triangular and Three Square Files  

These files are triangular in cross section. Triangular files  are single cut and are used for filing the gullet between saw  teeth. Three square files, which are double cut, may be used  for filing internal angles, clearing out corners, and filing taps  and cutters.  [Figure 11-17]  

![](images/29e62bd3b32749b8b152bd0939cecd9d3abd12ff4c3cf5b13a08ee42ea84d349.jpg)  
Figure 11-15.   Chisels.  

# Half-Round Files  

These files cut on both the flat and round sides. They may  be single or double cut. Their shape permits them to be used  where other files would be unsatisfactory.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Lead-Float Files  

These are especially designed for use on soft metals. They  are single cut and are made in various lengths.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Warding File  

Rectangular in section and tapers to narrow point in width.  This file is used for narrow space filing where other files  

![](images/c628633611cd7eb4905a25f67186b736bd30e37680c9860ab710ce893c5dbb79.jpg)

cannot be used.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Knife File  

Knife blade section. This file is used by tool and die makers  on work having acute angles.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Wood File  

Same section as flat and half-round files. This file has  coarser teeth and is especially adaptable for use on wood.  [Figure 11-17]  

# Vixen (Curved-Tooth Files)  

Curved-tooth files are especially designed for rapid filing and  smooth finish on soft metals and wood. The regular cut is  adapted for tough work on cast iron, soft steel, copper, brass,  aluminum, wood, slate, marble, fiber, rubber, and so forth. The  fine cut gives excellent results on steel, cast iron, phosphor  bronze, white brass, and all hard metals. The smooth cut is  used where the amount of material to be removed is very  slight, but where a superior finish is desired.  [Figure 11-17]  

The following methods are recommended for using files:  

1.	 Crossfiling. Before attempting to use a file, place  a handle on the tang of the file. This is essential  for proper guiding and safe use. In moving the file  endwise across the work (commonly known as  crossfiling), grasp the handle so that its end fits into  and against the fleshy part of the palm with the thumb  lying along the top of the handle in a lengthwise  direction. Grasp the end of the file between the thumb  and first two fingers. To prevent undue wear of the  file, relieve the pressure during the return stroke.  

2.	 Drawfiling. A file is sometimes used by grasping it  at each end, crosswise to the work, then moving it  lengthwise with the work. When done properly, work  may be finished somewhat finer than when cross filing  with the same file. In draw filing, the teeth of the file  produce a shearing effect. To accomplish this shearing  effect, the angle at which the file is held with respect  to its line of movement varies with different files,  depending on the angle at which the teeth are cut.  

![](images/f70cf0a2c5f0e5db6daa5d30c1d0e6df7531083d5df8ad46b5313283e6ef67b4.jpg)  
Figure 11-17.   Types of files.  

Pressure should be relieved during the backstroke.  

3.	 Rounding corners. The method used in filing a rounded  surface depends upon its width and the radius of the  rounded surface. If the surface is narrow or only a  portion of a surface is to be rounded, start the forward  stroke of the file with the point of the file inclined  downward at approximately a   $45^{\circ}$   angle. Using a  rocking chair motion, finish the stroke with the heel  of the file near the curved surface. This method allows  use of the full length of the file.  

4.	 Removing burred or slivered edges. Practically every  cutting operation on sheet metal produces burrs or  slivers. These must be removed to avoid personal  injury and to prevent scratching and marring of parts  to be assembled. Burrs and slivers prevent parts from  fitting properly and should always be removed from  

# Twist Drills  

Lathe filing requires that the file be held against the work  revolving in the lathe. The file should not be held rigid or  stationary but should be stroked constantly with a slight  gliding or lateral motion along the work. A standard mill file  may be used for this operation, but the long angle lathe file  provides a much cleaner shearing and self-clearing action.  Use a file with “safe” edges to protect work with shoulders  from being marred.  

# Care of Files  

There are several precautions that any good craftsman takes  in caring for files.  

1.	 Choose the right file for the material and work to be  performed. 2.	 Keep all files racked and separated so they do not bear  against each other. 3.	 Keep the files in a dry place—rust corrodes the teeth  points, dulling the file. 4.	 Keep files clean. Tap the end of the file against the  bench after every few strokes to loosen and clear the  filings. Use the file card to keep files clean—a dirty  file is a dull file. A dirty file can also contaminate  different metals when the same file is used on multiple  metal surfaces.  

Particles of metal collect between the teeth of a file and may  make deep scratches in the material being filed. When these  particles of metal are lodged too firmly between the teeth and  cannot be removed by tapping the edge of the file, remove  them with a file card or wire brush. Draw the brush across  the file so that the bristles pass down the gullet between the  teeth.  [Figure 11-18]  

# Drills  

The four types of portable drills used in aviation for holding  and turning twist drills are the hand drill, breast drill, electric  power drill, and pneumatic power drill. Holes   $\%$   inch in  diameter and under can be drilled using a hand drill. This  drill is commonly called an “egg beater.” The breast drill is  designed to hold larger size twist drills than the hand drill.  Also, a breastplate is affixed at the upper end of the drill  to permit the use of body weight to increase the cutting  power of the drill. Electric and pneumatic power drills are  available in various shapes and sizes to satisfy almost any  requirement. Pneumatic drills are preferred for use around  flammable materials, since sparks from an electric drill are  a fire or explosion hazard.  

A twist drill is a pointed tool that is rotated to cut holes in  material. It is made of a cylindrical hardened steel bar having  spiral flutes, or grooves, running the length of the body and  a conical point with cutting edges formed by the ends of  the flutes.  

Twist drills are made of carbon steel or high-speed alloy steel.  Carbon steel twist drills are satisfactory for the general run  of work and are relatively inexpensive. The more expensive  high-speed twist drills are used for the tough materials, such  as stainless steels. Twist drills have from one to four spiral  flutes. Drills with two flutes are used for most drilling.  Whereas those with three or four flutes are used principally  to follow smaller drills or to enlarge holes.  

The principal parts of a twist drill are the shank, the body, and  the heel.  [Figure 11-19]  The drill shank is the end that fits  into the chuck of a hand or power drill. The two shank shapes  most commonly used in hand drills are the straight shank and  the square or bit stock shank. The straight shank generally  is used in hand, breast, and portable electric or pneumatic  drills. The square shank is made to fit into a carpenter’s  brace. Tapered shanks generally are used in machine shop  drill presses.  [Figure 11-20]  

The metal column forming the core of the drill is the body.  The body clearance area lies just back of the margin. It is  slightly smaller in diameter than the margin to reduce the  friction between the drill and the sides of the hole. The angle  at which the drill point is ground is the lip clearance angle.  On standard drills used to cut steel and cast iron, the angle  should be  $59^{\circ}$   from the axis of the drill. For faster drilling of  soft materials, sharper angles are used.  

The diameter of a twist drill may be given in one of three  ways: by fractions, letters, or numbers. Fractionally, they are  classified by sixteenths of an inch (from  $\%$   to  $3\%$   inches), by  thirty-secondths (from  $\%_{2}$   to  $2\%$   inches), or by sixty-fourths  (from   $\%4$   to   $1\%$   inches). For a more exact measurement, a  letter system is used with decimal equivalents: A (0.234 inch)  to Z (0.413 inch). The number system of classification is most  accurate: No. 80 (0.0314 inch) to No. 1 (0.228 inch). Drill  sizes and their decimal equivalents are shown in  Figure 11-21 .  

The twist drill should be sharpened at the first sign of  dullness. For most drilling, a twist drill with a cutting angle  of   $118^{\circ}$     $59^{\circ}$   on either side of center) is sufficient. However,  when drilling soft metals, a cutting angle of   $90°$   may be  more efficient.  

Typical procedures for sharpening drills are as follows:  [Figure 11-22]  

![](images/ffda8540657bff0c64f80a7e46192200939f2c3d98805e48d24dde5ce0d2ec3d.jpg)  
Figure 11-18.   File card.  

1.	 Adjust the grinder tool rest to a convenient height for resting the back of the hand while grinding. 2.	 Hold the drill between the thumb and index finger of the right or left hand. Grasp the body of the drill near the shank with the other hand. 3.	 Place the hand on the tool rest with the centerline of the drill making a  $59^{\circ}$   angle with the cutting face of the grinding wheel. Lower the shank end of the drill slightly. 4.	 Slowly place the cutting edge of the drill against the grinding wheel. Gradually lower the shank of the drill  as you twist the drill in a clockwise direction. Maintain  pressure against the grinding surface only until you reach the heel of the drill. 5.	 Check the results of grinding with a gauge to determine  whether or not the lips are the same length and at a  $59^{\circ}$   angle.  

Alternatively, there are commercially available twist drill  grinders available, as well as attachments for bench grinders  that ensure consistent, even sharpening of twist drills.  

# Reamers  

Reamers are used to smooth and enlarge holes to exact size.  Hand reamers have square end shanks so that they can be  turned with a tap wrench or similar handle. The various types  of reamers are illustrated in  Figure 11-23 .  

A hole that is to be reamed to exact size must be drilled about 

 0.003 to 0.007 inch undersize. A cut that removes more than 

 0.007 inch places too much load on the reamer and should  not be attempted.  

Reamers are made of either carbon tool steel or high-speed  steel. The cutting blades of a high-speed steel reamer lose  their original keenness sooner than those of a carbon steel  reamer; however, after the first super keenness is gone, they  are still serviceable. The high-speed reamer usually lasts  much longer than the carbon steel type.  

Reamer blades are hardened to the point of being brittle and  

![](images/f27d34a9c4c0ddf041e2c0df553cda93e392a88e3201c0f54da0d1f91c9009a1.jpg)  
Figure 11-19.   Twist drill.

Figure 11-20.   Drill types.  

must be handled carefully to avoid chipping them. When  reaming a hole, rotate the reamer in the cutting direction only.  Do not back a reamer out of a hole by rotating it opposite  the cutting direction. Turn the reamer steadily and evenly to  prevent chattering, or marking and scoring of the hole walls.  

Reamers are available in any standard size. The straight fluted  reamer is less expensive than the spiral fluted reamer, but  the spiral type has less tendency to chatter. Both types are  tapered for a short distance back of the end to aid in starting.  Bottoming reamers have no taper and are used to complete  the reaming of blind holes.  

For general use, an expansion reamer is the most practical.  This type is furnished in standard sizes from  $\%$   inch to 1 inch,  increasing in diameter by  $\%_{32}$  -inch increments.  

Taper reamers, both hand and machine operated, are used to  smooth and true taper holes and recesses.  

# Countersink  

A countersink is a tool that cuts a cone-shaped depression  around the hole to allow a rivet or screw to set flush with the  surface of the material. Countersinks are made with various  angles to correspond to the various angles of the countersunk  rivet and screw heads. The angle of the standard countersink  shown in  Figure 11-24  is  $100^{\circ}$  .  

Special stop countersinks are available. Stop countersinks  are adjustable to any desired depth, and the cutters are  interchangeable so that holes of various countersunk angles  may be made. Some stop countersinks have a micrometer set  arrangement (in increments of 0.001 inch) for adjusting the  cutting depths.  [Figure 11-24]  

When using a countersink, care must be taken not to remove  an excessive amount of material, since this reduces the  strength of flush joints.  

# Taps and Dies  

A tap is used to cut threads on the inside of a hole, while a  die is for cutting external threads on round stock. They are  made of hard tempered steel and ground to an exact size.  There are four types of threads that can be cut with standard  taps and dies: National Coarse, National Fine, National Extra  Fine, and National Pipe.  

it is tapered back for 6 to 7 threads. This tap cuts a complete  thread when it is cutting above the taper. It is the only tap  needed when tapping holes that extend through thin sections.  The plug tap supplements the taper tap for tapping holes in  thick stock.  

The bottoming tap is not tapered. It is used to cut full threads  to the bottom of a blind hole.  

Dies may be classified as adjustable round split die and plain  round split die. The adjustable split die has an adjusting  screw that can be tightened so that the die is spread slightly.  By adjusting the die, the diameter and fit of the thread can  be controlled.  [Figure 11-26]  

Solid dies are not adjustable. Therefore, a variety of thread  fits cannot be obtained with this type. There are many types  of wrenches for turning taps, as well as turning dies. The  T-handle, the adjustable tap wrench, and the diestock for round  split dies shown in  Figure 11-27  are a few of the more common  types. Information on thread sizes, fits, types, and drill speeds  are shown in shown in  Figure 11-28  through  11-30 .  

# Layout and Measuring Tools  

Layout and measuring devices are precision tools. They are  carefully machined, accurately marked and, in many cases,  are made up of very delicate parts. When using these tools,  be careful not to drop, bend, or scratch them. The finished  product is no more accurate than the measurements or the  layout; therefore, it is very important to understand how to  read, use, and care for these tools.  

# Rules  

Rules are made of steel and are either rigid or flexible. The  flexible steel rule bends, but it should not be bent intentionally  as it may be broken rather easily. In aircraft work, the unit  of measure most commonly used is the inch. The inch may  be divided into smaller parts by means of either common or  decimal fraction divisions.  

The fractional divisions for an inch are found by dividing  the inch into equal parts: halves   $(\%)$  , quarters   $(\%)$  , eighths 

  $(\%)$  , sixteenths   $(\%)$  , thirty-secondths  $(\%)$  , and sixty-fourths 

  $(\%4)$  . The fractions of an inch may be expressed in decimals,  called decimal equivalents of an inch. For example,   $\%$  inch is expressed as 0.0125 (one hundred twenty-five ten- thousandths of an inch).  

Hand taps are usually provided in sets of three taps for each  diameter and thread series. Each set contains a taper tap, a  plug tap, and a bottoming tap. The taps in a set are identical  in diameter and cross section and the only difference is the  amount of taper.  [Figure 11-25]  

The taper tap is used to begin the tapping process, because

Figure 11-23.   Reamers.  

Rules are manufactured in two basic styles — those divided or  marked in common fractions and those divided or marked in  decimals or divisions of one one-hundredth of an inch. A rule  may be used either as a measuring tool or as a straightedge.  [Figure 11-31]  

# Combination Sets  

The combination set, as its name implies, is a tool that has  several uses. It can be used for the same purposes as an  ordinary tri-square, but it differs from the tri-square in that  the head slides along the blade and can be clamped at any  desired place. Combined with the square or stock head are  a level and scriber. The head slides in a central groove on  the blade or scale, which can be used separately as a rule.  [Figure 11-32]  

The spirit level in the stock head makes it convenient to  square a piece of material with a surface and at the same time  tell whether one or the other is plumb or level. The head can  be used alone as a simple level.  

The combination of square head and blade can also be used  as a marking gauge to scribe lines at a   $45^{\circ}$   angle, as a depth  gauge, or as a height gauge. A convenient scriber is held  frictionally in the head by a small brass bushing.

Figure 11-24.   Countersinks.  

The center head is used to find the center of shafts or other  cylindrical work. The protractor head can be used to check  angles and also may be set at any desired angle to draw lines.  

# Scriber  

The scriber is designed to serve the aviation mechanic in  the same way a pencil or pen serves a writer. In general, it is  used to scribe or mark lines on metal surfaces. The scriber is  made of tool steel, 4 to 12 inches long, and has two needle  pointed ends. One end is bent at a  $90°$   angle for reaching and  

![](images/5b1068ad8edda2a1a33dbf42a7c868ddb8fe440045318966597f3d867f43e4d0.jpg)

marking through holes.  [Figure 11-33]  

Before using a scriber, always inspect the points for  sharpness. Be sure the straightedge is flat on the metal  and in position for scribing. Tilt the scriber slightly in the  direction toward which it will be moved, holding it like a  pencil. Keep the scriber’s point close to the guiding edge of  the straightedge. The scribed line should be heavy enough to  be visible, but no deeper than necessary to serve its purpose.

It is very important to use a scribe only where it is defining  a line to be cut as scribed lines may introduce stress points  where failures can occur.  

# Dividers and Pencil Compasses  

Dividers and pencil compasses have two legs joined at the  top by a pivot. They are used to scribe circles and arcs and  for transferring measurements from the rule to the work.  

Pencil compasses have one leg tapered to a needle point. The  other leg has a pencil or pencil lead inserted. Dividers have  both legs tapered to needle points.  

When using pencil compasses or dividers, the following  procedures are suggested:  

1.	 Inspect the points to make sure they are sharp. 2.	 To set the dividers or compasses, hold them with the  point of one leg in the graduations on the rule. Turn the  adjustment nut with the thumb and forefinger. Adjust  the dividers or compasses until the point of the other  leg rests on the graduation of the rule that gives the  required measurement. 3.	 To draw an arc or circle with either the pencil  compasses or dividers, hold the thumb attachment on  the top with the thumb and forefinger. With pressure  exerted on both legs, swing the compass in a clockwise  direction and draw the desired arc or circle. 4.	 The tendency for the legs to slip is avoided by inclining  the compasses or dividers in the direction in which  they are being rotated. In working on metals, the  dividers are used only to scribe arcs or circles that are  later removed by cutting. All other arcs or circles are  drawn with pencil compasses to avoid scratching the  material. 5.	 On paper layouts, the pencil compasses are used for  

describing arcs and circles. Dividers should be used to  transfer critical measurements because they are more  accurate than a pencil compass.  

# Calipers  

Calipers are used for measuring diameters and distances or  for comparing distances and sizes. The three common types  of calipers are inside, outside, and hermaphrodite calipers,  such as gear tool calipers.  [Figure 11-34]  

Outside calipers are used for measuring outside dimensions— for example, the diameter of a piece of round stock. Inside  calipers have outward curved legs for measuring inside  diameters, such as diameters of holes, the distance between  two surfaces, the width of slots, and other similar jobs. A  hermaphrodite caliper is generally used as a marking gauge in  layout work. It should not be used for precision measurement.  

# Micrometer Calipers  

There are four types of micrometer calipers, each designed  for a specific use: outside micrometer, inside micrometer,  depth micrometer, and thread micrometer.  

Micrometers are available in a variety of sizes, either 0 to   $\%$   inch, 0 to 1 inch, 1 to 2 inch, 2 to 3 inch, 3 to 4 inch, 4 to  5 inch, or 5 to 6 inch sizes. In addition to the micrometer  inscribed with the measurement markings, micrometers  equipped with electronic digital liquid crystal display (LCD)  readouts are also in common use.  

The AMT uses the outside micrometer more often than any  other type. It may be used to measure the outside dimensions  of shafts, thickness of sheet metal stock, the diameter of drills,  and for many other applications.  [Figure 11-35]  

The smallest measurement that can be made with the use  of the steel rule is one sixty-fourth of an inch in common  fractions and one one-hundredth of an inch in decimal  fractions. To measure more closely than this (in thousandths  and ten-thousandths of an inch), a micrometer is used. If a  dimension given in a common fraction is to be measured  with the micrometer, the fraction must be converted to its  decimal equivalent.  

All four types of micrometers are read in the same way. The  method of reading an outside micrometer is discussed later  in this chapter.  

# Micrometer Parts  

The fixed parts of a micrometer are the frame, barrel, and anvil.  The movable parts of a micrometer are the thimble and spindle.  The thimble rotates the spindle, which moves in the threaded  portion inside the barrel. Turning the thimble provides an  

![Figure 11-28.   American (National) screw thread sizes. ](images/a96fbb41a63f35318e2f368ff55fa07fcde24fa3389fba375ddff538b9b4a4d1.jpg)

opening between the anvil and the end of the spindle where  the work is measured. The size of the work is indicated by the  graduations on the barrel and thimble.  [Figure 11-36]  

# Reading a Micrometer  

The lines on the barrel marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth,  indicate measurements of tenths, or 0.100 inch, 0.200 inch,  0.300 inch, 0.400 inch, respectively.  [Figure 11-37]  

Each of the sections between the tenths divisions (between 1,  2, 3, 4, and so forth) is divided into four parts of 0.025 inch  each. One complete revolution of the thimble (from zero on  the thimble around to the same zero) moves it one of these  divisions (0.025 inch) along the barrel.  

The bevel edge of the thimble is divided into 25 equal parts.  Each of these parts represents one twenty-fifth of the distance  the thimble travels along the barrel in moving from one of  the 0.025 inch divisions to another. Thus, each division on  the thimble represents one one-thousandth (0.001) of an inch.  

These divisions are marked for convenience at every five  spaces by 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. When 25 of these graduations  have passed the horizontal line on the barrel, the spindle  (having made one revolution) has moved 0.025 inch.  

The micrometer is read by first noting the last visible figure  on the horizontal line of the barrel representing tenths of an  inch. Add to this the length of barrel between the thimble and  the previously noted number. (This is found by multiplying  

![](images/51fb73f21b13460b23759dcb2dff25ab930ea03307d261da9af7d014929644c8.jpg)  
Figure 11-34.   Calipers.  

the number of graduations by 0.025 inch.) Add to this the  number of divisions on the bevel edge of the thimble that  coincides with the line of the graduation. The total of the three  figures equals the measurement.  [Figure 11-38]  

# Vernier Scale  

Some micrometers are equipped with a vernier scale that  makes it possible to directly read the fraction of a division  that is indicated on the thimble scale. Typical examples of  the vernier scale as it applies to the micrometer are shown  in  Figure 11-39 .  

All three scales on a micrometer are not fully visible  without turning the micrometer, but the examples shown  in  Figure 11-38  are drawn as though the barrel and thimble  of the micrometer were laid out flat so that all three scales  can be seen at the same time. The barrel scale is the lower  horizontal scale, the thimble scale is vertical on the right,  and the long horizontal lines (0 through 9 and 0) make up  the vernier scale.  

In reading a micrometer, an excellent way to remember  the relative scale values is to remember that the 0.025 inch  barrel scale graduations are established by the lead screw (40  threads per inch). Next, the thimble graduations divide the  0.025 inch into 25 parts, each equal to 0.001 inch. Then, the  vernier graduations divide the 0.001 inch into 10 equal parts,  each equal to 0.0001 inch. Remembering the values of the  various scale graduations, the barrel scale reading is noted.  The thimble scale reading is added to it, then the vernier  scale reading is added to get the final reading. The vernier  scale line to be read is always the one aligned exactly with  

![](images/4ccda6720d1d53b06d23d6c0e5c26ab34221fc73a6570b4bd58a25575f6942ff.jpg)

any thimble graduation.  

In the first example in  Figure 11-39 , the barrel reads  0.275 inch and the thimble reads more than 0.019 inch. The  number 1 graduation on the thimble is aligned exactly with  the number 4 graduation on the vernier scale. Thus, the final  reading is 0.2944 inch.  

In the second example in Figure 11-39, the barrel reads 0.275  

![](images/c4000175fb2dbe211c1b3ea295c2de6b957507e4dc38e43c756c9a8fcf4e2ca7.jpg)  
Figure 11-36.   Outside micrometer parts.  

inch, and the thimble reads more than 0.020 inch and less than  0.021 inch. On the Vernier scale, the number 0 graduation  coincides closest with the line on the thimble. This means  that the thimble reading would be 0.020 inch. Adding this to  the barrel reading of 0.275 inch gives a total measurement  of 0.2950 inch.  

The third and fourth examples in  Figure 11-39  are additional  readings that would require use of the Vernier scale for  accurate readings to ten-thousandths of an inch.  

# Using a Micrometer  

The micrometer must be handled carefully. If it is dropped,  its accuracy may be permanently affected. Continually sliding  work between the anvil and spindle may wear the surfaces. If  the spindle is tightened too much, the frame may be sprung  permanently and inaccurate readings will result. In any  event, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration  procedures and types of gauges to be used, such as gauge  blocks, gauge pins, or ring gauges.  

To measure a piece of work with the micrometer, hold the  frame of the micrometer in the palm of the hand with the  little finger or third finger, whichever is more convenient.  This allows the thumb and forefinger to be free to revolve  the thimble for adjustment.  

A variation of the micrometer is the dial indicator, which  measures variations in a surface by using an accurately  machined probe mechanically-linked to a circular hand whose  movement indicates thousandths of an inch or is displayed  on a LCD screen.  [Figure 11-40]  

A typical example would be using a dial indicator to  measure the amount of runout, or bend, in a shaft. If a bend  is suspected, the part can be rotated while resting between a  pair of machined V-blocks. A dial indicator is then clamped  to a machine table stand, and the probe of the indicator is  positioned so it lightly contacts the surface. The outer portion

of the dial is then rotated until the needle is pointed at zero.  The part is then rotated, and the amount of bend, or run out,  is displayed on the dial as the needle fluctuates. The total  amount of the fluctuation is the runout.  

Another common use for the dial indicator is to check for a  warp in a rotating component, such as a brake disc. In some  cases, this can be done with the brake disc installed on the  airplane, with the base clamped to a stationary portion of  the structure.  

In either case, it is imperative that the dial indicator be  securely fastened so that movement of the indicator itself  induces no errors in measurement.  

# Slide Calipers  

Often used to measure the length of an object, the slide  caliper provides greater accuracy than the ruler. It can, by  virtue of its specially formed jaws, measure both inside and  outside dimensions. As the tool’s name implies, the slide  caliper jaw is slid along a graduated scale, and its jaws then  contact the inside or outside of the object to be measured. The  measurement is then read on the scale located on the body  of the caliper or on the LCD screen.  [Figure 11-41]  Some  slide calipers also contain a depth gauge for measuring the  depth of blind holes.

# Chapter 12 Fundamentals of Electricity &  Electronics  

# Introduction  

This chapter addresses the fundamental concepts that are  the building blocks for advanced electrical knowledge and  practical troubleshooting. Some of the questions addressed  are: How does energy travel through a copper wire and  through space? What is electric current and electromotive  force? What makes a landing light turn on or a hydraulic  pump motor run? Each of these questions requires an  understanding of many basic principles. By adding one  basic idea on top of other basic ideas, it becomes possible  to answer most of the interesting and practical questions  about electricity or electronics.  

Our understanding of electrical current must begin with the  nature of matter. All matter is composed of molecules. All  molecules are made up of atoms, which are themselves made  up of electrons, protons, and neutrons.  

# General Composition of Matter  

# Matter  

Matter can be defined as anything that has mass and volume  and is the substance of which physical objects are composed.  Essentially, it is anything that can be touched. Matter is what  all things are made of; whatever occupies space, has mass,  and is perceptible to the senses in some way. Weight is an  indirect method of determining mass, but it is not the same.  Weight is a measure of the pull of gravity acting on the mass  of an object. The more mass an object has, the more it weighs  under the earth’s force of gravity. Mathematically, weight can  be stated as follows:  

#  ${\mathrm{Weibt}}={\mathrm{Mass}}\times{\mathrm{GIV}}$  

Categories of matter are ordered by molecular activity.  The four categories or states are: solids, liquids, gases, and  plasma. For the purposes of the aircraft technician, only  solids, liquids, and gases are considered.  

# Element  

An element is a substance that cannot be reduced to a  simpler form by chemical means. Iron, gold, silver, copper,  and oxygen are examples of elements. Beyond this point of  reduction, the element ceases to be what it is.  

# Compound  

A compound is a chemical combination of two or more  elements. Water is one of the most common compounds and  is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  

# Molecule  

The smallest particle of matter that can exist and still retain  its identity, such as water   $\mathrm{(H}_{2}\mathrm{O)}$  , is called a molecule.  [Figure 12-1]  Substances composed of only one type of atom  are called elements. But most substances occur in nature as  compounds, that is, combinations of two or more types of  atoms. It would no longer retain the characteristics of water if  it were compounded of one atom of hydrogen and two atoms  of oxygen. If a drop of water is divided and then divided again  and again until it cannot be divided any longer, it is still water.  

# Atom  

The atom is considered to be the most basic building block  of all matter. Atoms are composed of three subatomic  particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. These three  particles determine the properties of the specific atoms.  Elements are substances composed of the same atoms with  specific properties. Oxygen is an example of this. The main  property that defines each element is the number of neutrons,  protons, and electrons. Hydrogen and helium are examples  of elements. Both of these elements have neutrons, protons,  and electrons but differ in the number of those items. This  difference alone accounts for the variations in chemical and  physical properties of these two different elements. There are  over 100 known elements in the periodic table.  [Figure 12-2] They are categorized according to their properties on that  table. The kinetic theory of matter also states that the  particles that make up the matter are always moving. Thermal  expansion is considered in the kinetic theory and explains  why matter contracts when it is cool and expands when it is  hot, with the exception of water/ice.  

# Electrons, Protons, & Neutrons  

At the center of the atom is the nucleus, which contains  protons and neutrons. Protons are positively-charged  particles, and neutrons are neutrally-charged particles. A  neutron has approximately the same mass as the proton. The  third particle of the atom is the electron that is a negatively- charged particle with a very small mass compared to the  proton. The proton’s mass is approximately 1,837 times  greater than the electron. Due to the proton and the neutron  location in the central portion of the atom (nucleus) and the  electron’s position at the distant periphery of the atom, it  is the electron that undergoes the change during chemical  reactions. Since a proton weighs approximately 1,845 times  as much as an electron, the number of protons and neutrons  in its nucleus determines the overall weight of an atom. The  weight of an electron is not considered in determining the  weight of an atom. Indeed, the nature of electricity cannot be  defined clearly because it is not certain whether the electron  is a negative charge with no mass (weight) or a particle of  matter with a negative charge.  

Hydrogen represents the simplest form of an atom.  [Figure 12-3]  At the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is one  proton and at the outer shell is one orbiting electron. At a  more complex level is the oxygen atoms, which has eight  electrons in two shells orbiting the nucleus with eight protons  and eight neutrons.  [Figure 12-4]  When the total positive  charge of the protons in the nucleus equals the total negative  charge of the electrons in orbit around the nucleus, the atom  is said to have a neutral charge.  

# Electron Shells & Energy Levels  

Electrons require a certain amount of energy to stay in an  orbit. This particular quantity is called the electron’s energy  level. By its motion alone, the electron possesses kinetic  energy, while the electron’s position in orbit determines its  potential energy. The total energy of an electron is the main  factor that determines the radius of the electron’s orbit. Electrons of an atom appear only at certain definite energy  levels (shells). The spacing between energy levels is such  that when the chemical properties of the various elements are  cataloged, it is convenient to group several closely spaced  permissible energy levels together into electron shells. The  

![](images/33d048de929d33727e9defcf1363cc2ef77b1596c04664b96b5957b61f6aeb1f.jpg)  
Figure 12-1.   A water molecule.  

maximum number of electrons that can be contained in any  shell or sub-shell is the same for all atoms and is defined as  electron capacity  $=2\mathsf{n}^{2}$  . In this equation, n represents the  energy level in question. The first shell can only contain two  electrons; the second shell can only contain eight electrons;  the third, 18, and so on until we reach the seventh shell for  the heaviest atoms, which have six energy levels. Because the  innermost shell is the lowest energy level, the shell begins to  fill up from the shell closest to the nucleus and fill outward  as the atomic number of the element increases. However,  an energy level does not need to be completely filled before  electrons begin to fill the next level. The Periodic Table  of Elements should be checked to determine an element’s  electron configuration.  

# Valence Electrons  

Valence is the number of chemical bonds an atom can  form. Valence electrons are electrons that can participate in  chemical bonds with other atoms. The number of electrons  in the outermost shell of the atom is the determining factor  in its valence. Therefore, the electrons contained in this shell  are called valence electrons.  

# Ions  

Ionization is the process by which an atom loses or gains  electrons. Dislodging an electron from an atom causes the  atom to become positively charged. This net positively- charged atom is called a positive ion or a cation. An atom  that has gained an extra number of electrons is negatively  charged and is called a negative ion or an anion. When atoms  are neutral, the positively-charged proton and the negatively- charged electron are equal.  

# Free Electrons  

Valence electrons are found drifting midway between two  nuclei. Some electrons are more tightly bound to the nucleus  of their atom than others and are positioned in a shell or sphere  closer to the nucleus, while others are more loosely bound and  orbit at a greater distance from the nucleus. These outermost  electrons are called “free” electrons because they can be easily  dislodged from the positive attraction of the protons in the  nucleus. Once freed from the atom, the electron can then travel  from atom to atom, becoming the flow of electrons commonly  called current in a practical electrical circuit.  

# Electron Movement  

# Conductors, Insulators, and Semiconductors  

The valence of an atom determines its ability to gain or  lose an electron, which ultimately determines the chemical  and electrical properties of the atom. These properties can  be categorized as being a conductor, semiconductor, or  insulator, depending on the ability of the material to produce  free electrons. When a material has a large number of free  

![](images/55b43771a3f0878d8c74c691d867795daf2b1722618ee64b7ba53c58b1158a2a.jpg)

electrons available, a greater current can be conducted in  the material.  

# Conductors  

Elements such as gold, copper, and silver possess many free  electrons and make good conductors. The atoms in these  materials have a few loosely bound electrons in their outer  orbits. Energy in the form of heat can cause these electrons  in the outer orbit to break loose and drift throughout the  material. Copper and silver have one electron in their outer  orbits. At room temperature, a piece of silver wire has billions

of free electrons.  

# Insulators  

Insulators are materials that do not conduct electrical current  very well or not at all, such as glass, ceramic, and plastic.  

Under normal conditions, atoms in these materials do not  produce free electrons. The absence of free electrons means  that electrical current cannot be conducted through the  material. Only when the material is in an extremely strong  electrical field will the outer electrons be dislodged. This  action is called breakdown and usually causes physical  damage to the insulator.  

# Semiconductors  

The material properties of semiconductors fall in between  conductors and insulators. In their pure state, they are not  good at conducting or insulating. Semiconductors can operate  like a conductor or insulator depending on what external load  is placed on the material. Semiconductors are used to make  transistors and integrated circuits. Silicon and germanium  are the most widely used semiconductor materials. For a  more detailed explanation on this topic, refer to page 12-98  in this chapter.  

# Metric Based Prefixes Used for Electrical  Calculations  

In any system of measurements, a single set of units is usually  not sufficient for all the computations involved in electrical  repair and maintenance. Small distances, for example, can  usually be measured in inches, but larger distances are  more meaningfully expressed in feet, yards, or miles. Since  electrical values often vary from numbers that are a millionth  part of a basic unit of measurement to very large values, it is  often necessary to use a wide range of numbers to represent  the values of units, such as volts, amperes, or ohms. A series  of prefixes that appear with the name of the unit have been  devised for the various multiples or submultiples of the basic  units. There are 12 of these prefixes, which are also known as  conversion factors. Four of the most commonly used prefixes  in electrical work are:  

Mega (M) means one million (1,000,000).  Kilo (k) means one thousand (1,000). Milli (m) means one-thousandth (1⁄1,000). Micro   $(\upmu)$   means one-millionth (1⁄1,000,000).  

Kilo is one of the most extensively used conversion factors. It  explains the use of prefixes with basic units of measurement.  Kilo means 1,000, and when used with volts, is expressed as  kilovolt, meaning 1,000 volts. The symbol for kilo is the letter  “k.” Thus, 1,000 volts is one kilovolt or   $1\;\mathrm{kV}.$   Conversely,  one volt would equal one-thousandth of a kV, or  $1{\mathcal{A}}1{,}000\,\mathrm{kV}.$  This could also be written  $0.001\;\mathrm{kV}.$  

Similarly, the word “milli” means one-thousandth, and  thus, 1 millivolt equals one-thousandth (1⁄1000) of a volt.  Figure 12-5  contains a complete list of the multiples used to  express electrical quantities, together with the prefixes and  symbols used to represent each number.  

# Static Electricity  

Electricity is often described as being either static or dynamic.  The difference between the two is based simply on whether  the electrons are at rest (static) or in motion (dynamic). Static  electricity is a buildup of an electrical charge on the surface  of an object. It is considered “static” due to the fact that there  is no current flowing as in alternate current (AC) or direct  current (DC) electricity. Static electricity is usually caused  when non-conductive materials, such as rubber, plastic, or  glass, are rubbed together causing a transfer of electrons,  which results in an imbalance of charges between the two  materials. The fact that there is an imbalance of charges  between the two materials means that the objects will exhibit  an attractive or repulsive force.  

# Attractive and Repulsive Forces  

One of the most fundamental laws of static electricity, as  well as magnetics, deals with attraction and repulsion. Like  charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.  All electrons possess a negative charge and as such repel each  other. Similarly, all protons possess a positive charge and  as such repel each other. Electrons (negative) and protons  (positive) are opposite in their charge and attract each other.  

For example, if two pith balls are suspended, as shown in  Figure 12-6 , and each ball is touched with the charged glass  rod, some of the charge from the rod is transferred to the balls.  The balls now have similar charges and, consequently, repel  each other as shown in part B of  Figure 12-6 . If a plastic rod  is rubbed with fur, it becomes negatively charged and the  fur is positively charged. By touching each ball with these  differently charged sources, the balls obtain opposite charges  and attract each other as shown in part C of  Figure 12-6 .  

Although most objects become charged with static electricity  by means of friction, a charged substance can also influence  objects near it by contact.  [Figure 12-7]  If a positively-charged  rod touches an uncharged metal bar, it draws electrons from  the uncharged bar to the point of contact. Some electrons enter  the rod, leaving the metal bar with a deficiency of electrons  (positively charged) and making the rod less positive than it  was or, perhaps, even neutralizing its charge completely.  

A method of charging a metal bar by induction is demonstrated  in  Figure 12-8 . A positively-charged rod is brought near, but  does not touch, an uncharged metal bar. Electrons in the metal  bar are attracted to the end of the bar nearest the positively- charged rod, leaving a deficiency of electrons at the opposite  end of the bar. If this positively-charged end is touched by  a neutral object, electrons will flow into the metal bar and  neutralize the charge. The metal bar is left with an overall  excess of electrons.  

# Electrostatic Field  

A field of force exists around a charged body. This field is  an electrostatic field (sometimes called a dielectric field) and  is represented by lines extending in all directions from the  charged body and terminating where there is an equal and  opposite charge.  

To explain the action of an electrostatic field, lines are used  to represent the direction and intensity of the electric field  of force. As illustrated in  Figure 12-9 , the intensity of the  field is indicated by the number of lines per unit area, and  the direction is shown by arrowheads on the lines pointing  in the direction in which a small test charge would move (or  tend to move) if acted upon by the field of force.  

Either a positive or negative test charge can be used, but it  has been arbitrarily agreed that a small positive charge is  always used in determining the direction of the field. Thus,  the direction of the field around a positive charge is always  away from the charge because a positive test charge would  be repelled.  [Figure 12-9]  On the other hand, the direction of  the lines about a negative charge is toward the charge, since  a positive test charge is attracted toward it.  

Figure 12-10  illustrates the field around bodies having like  charges. Positive charges are shown, but regardless of the  type of charge, the lines of force would repel each other if the  charges were alike. The lines terminate on material objects  and always extend from a positive charge to a negative  charge. These are imaginary lines used to show the direction  a real force takes.  

It is important to know how a charge is distributed on an  object.  Figure 12-11  shows a small metal disk on which  

![Figure 12-5.   Prefixes and symbols for multiples of basic quantities. 0.000000000001   ](images/9a900e8e054f85bdd1ad7fb616d1de511303f819d924ada2bb55c87cc9a370e4.jpg)  

a concentrated negative charge has been placed. By using  an electrostatic detector, it can be shown that the charge is  spread evenly over the entire surface of the disk. Since the  metal disk provides uniform resistance everywhere on its  surface, the mutual repulsion of electrons results in an even  distribution over the entire surface.  

Another example, shown in  Figure 12-12 , is the charge on  a hollow sphere. Although the sphere is made of conducting  material, the charge is evenly distributed over the outside  surface. The inner surface is completely neutral. This  phenomenon is used to safeguard operating personnel of the  large Van de Graaff static generators used for atom smashing.  The safest area for the operators is inside the large sphere,  where millions of volts are being generated.  

The distribution of the charge on an irregularly-shaped object  differs from that on a regularly-shaped object.  Figure 12-13 shows that the charge on such objects is not evenly  distributed. The greatest charge is at the points, or areas of  sharpest curvature, of the objects.  

# Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Considerations  

One of the most frequent causes of damage to a solid-  state component or integrated circuits is the electrostatic  discharge (ESD) from the human body when one of these  devices is handled. Careless handling of line replaceable  units (LRUs), circuit cards, and discrete components can  cause unnecessarily time consuming and expensive repairs.  This damage can occur if a technician touches the mating  pins for a card or box. Other sources for ESD can be the top  of a toolbox that is covered with a carpet. Damage can be  avoided by discharging the static electricity from your body  by touching the chassis of the removed box, by wearing  a grounding wrist strap, and exercising good professional  handling of the components in the aircraft. This can include  placing protective caps over open connectors and not placing  an ESD-sensitive component in an environment that causes  damage. Parts that are ESD sensitive are typically shipped  in bags specially designed to protect components from  electrostatic damage.  

Other precautions that should be taken with working with  electronic components are:  

1.	 Always connect a ground between test equipment and  circuit before attempting to inject or monitor a signal. 2.	 Ensure test voltages do not exceed maximum  allowable voltage for the circuit components and  transistors. 3.	 Ohmmeter ranges that require a current of more than  one milliampere in the test circuit should not be used  for testing transistors.

Figure 12-6.   Reaction of like and unlike charges.  

4.	 The heat applied to a diode or transistor, when  soldering is required, should be kept to a minimum  by using low-wattage soldering irons and heat sinks. 5.	 Do not pry components of a circuit board. 6.	 Power must be removed from a circuit before replacing  a component. 7.	 When using test probes on equipment and the space  between the test points is very close, keep the exposed  portion of the leads as small as possible to prevent  shorting.  

# Magnetism  

Magnetism is defined as the property of an object to attract  certain metallic substances. In general, these substances are  ferrous materials; that is, materials composed of iron or iron  

![](images/c4291163b79b877c3c1aa5897b4423a838fe1245c9d30b3f55698276e2cd97b8.jpg)

alloys, such as soft iron, steel, and alnico. These materials,  sometimes called magnetic materials, include at least three  nonferrous materials: nickel, cobalt, and gadolinium, which  are magnetic to a limited degree. All other substances are  considered nonmagnetic. A few of these non-magnetic  substances can be classified as diamagnetic since they are  repelled by both poles of a magnet.  

Magnetism is an invisible force, the ultimate nature of which  has not been fully determined. It can best be described by  the effects it produces. Examination of a simple bar magnet  similar to that illustrated in  Figure 12-14  discloses some basic  characteristics of all magnets. If the magnet is suspended to  

![](images/3d41c0a7aa0397fbebbc238cc449663d69f322d7c7afe276b2e0498e7b31f75d.jpg)

swing freely, it aligns itself with the earth’s magnetic poles.  One end is labeled “N,” meaning the North seeking end or  pole of the magnet. If the “N” end of a compass or magnet  is referred to as North seeking rather than North, there is no  conflict in referring to the pole it seeks, which is the North  magnetic pole. The opposite end of the magnet, marked “S”  is the South seeking end and points to the South magnetic  pole. Since the earth is a giant magnet, its poles attract  the ends of the magnet. These poles are not located at the  geographic poles.  

The somewhat mysterious and completely invisible force  of a magnet depends on a magnetic field that surrounds the  magnet.  [Figure 12-15]  This field always exists between  the poles of a magnet and arranges itself to conform to the  shape of any magnet.  

The theory that explains the action of a magnet holds that each  molecule making up the iron bar is itself a tiny magnet, with  both North and South poles as illustrated in  Figure 12-16A .  These molecular magnets each possess a magnetic field,  but in an unmagnetized state, the molecules are arranged at  random throughout the iron bar. If a magnetizing force, such  as stroking with a lodestone, is applied to the unmagnetized  

![](images/688cec62a2c74ca24c79efedb8761a7d8f8690b653941a07fa1280b0b20a9c53.jpg)  
Figure 12-13.   Charge on irregularly-shaped objects.  

bar, the molecular magnets rearrange themselves in line with  the magnetic field of the lodestone, with all North ends of the  magnets pointing in one direction and all South ends in the  opposite direction.  [Figure 12-16B]  In such a configuration,  the magnetic fields of the magnets combine to produce the  total field of the magnetized bar.  

When handling a magnet, avoid applying direct heat,  hammering, or dropping it. Heating or sudden shock creates  misalignment of the molecules, causing the strength of a  magnet to decrease. When a magnet is to be stored, devices  known as “keeper bars” are installed to provide an easy path  for flux lines from one pole to the other. This promotes the  retention of the molecules in their North-South alignment.  

The presence of the magnetic force or field around a magnet  can best be demonstrated by the experiment illustrated in  Figure 12-17 . A sheet of transparent material, such as glass  or Lucite™, is placed over a bar magnet and iron filings are  sprinkled slowly on this transparent shield. If the glass or  Lucite™ is tapped lightly, the iron filings arrange themselves  in a definite pattern around the bar, forming a series of lines  from the North to South end of the bar to indicate the pattern  of the magnetic field.  

As shown, the field of a magnet is made up of many individual  forces that appear as lines in the iron filing demonstration.  Although they are not “lines” in the ordinary sense, this word  is used to describe the individual nature of the separate forces  making up the entire magnetic field. These lines of force are  also referred to as magnetic flux.  

They are separate and individual forces, since one line will  never cross another; indeed, they actually repel one another.  They remain parallel to one another and resemble stretched  rubber bands, since they are held in place around the bar by  the internal magnetizing force of the magnet.  

The demonstration with iron filings further shows that the  magnetic field of a magnet is concentrated at the ends of  the magnet. These areas of concentrated flux are called the  North and South poles of the magnet. There is a limit to the  number of lines of force that can be crowded into a magnet of  a given size. When a magnetizing force is applied to a piece  of magnetic material, a point is reached where no more lines  of force can be induced or introduced. The material is then  said to be saturated.  

The characteristics of the magnetic flux can be demonstrated  by tracing the flux patterns of two bar magnets with like poles  together.  [Figure 12-18]  The two like poles repel one another  because the lines of force will not cross each other. As the  arrows on the individual lines indicate, the lines turn aside as  

![](images/d5880368e8d1541f6f31d0e3be221b50bbf3082ddac0a1d77c7cd135cee4d3c1.jpg)  
Figure 12-14.   One end of magnetized strip points to the magnetic  North pole.  

the two like poles are brought near each other and travel in a  path parallel to each other. Lines moving in this manner repel  each other, causing the magnets as a whole to repel each other.  

By reversing the position of one of the magnets, the attraction  of unlike poles can be demonstrated.  [Figure 12-19]  As the  unlike poles are brought near each other, the lines of force  rearrange their paths and most of the flux leaving the North  pole of one magnet enters the South pole of the other. The  tendency of lines of force to repel each other is indicated by  the bulging of the flux in the air gap between the two magnets.  

To further demonstrate that lines of force do not cross  one another, a bar magnet and a horseshoe magnet can be  positioned to display a magnetic field similar to that of  

![](images/1f1fdedb0fb1c0878f5fb81af463aeb36aea06f5721377ec17f3f4fcc8cafef2.jpg)

Figure 12-16.   Arrangement of molecules in a piece of magnetic material.  

Figure 12-20 . The magnetic fields of the two magnets do  not combine, but are rearranged into a distorted flux pattern.  

The two bar magnets may be held in the hands and the North  poles brought near each other to demonstrate the force of  repulsion between like poles. In a similar manner, the two  South poles can demonstrate this force. The force of attraction  between unlike poles can be felt by bringing a South and a  North end together.  [Figure 12-21]  

Figure 12-22  illustrates another characteristic of magnets.  If the bar magnet is cut or broken into pieces, each piece  immediately becomes a magnet itself, with a North and South  pole. This feature supports the theory that each molecule  is a magnet, since each successive division of the magnet  produces more magnets.  

Since the magnetic lines of force form a continuous loop,  they form a magnetic circuit. It is impossible to say where in  the magnet they originate or start. Arbitrarily, it is assumed  that all lines of force leave the North pole of any magnet and  enter at the South pole.  

There is no known insulator for magnetic flux, or lines of  force, since they pass through all materials. However, they do  pass through some materials more easily than others. Thus,  it is possible to shield items, such as instruments, from the  effects of the flux by surrounding them with a material that  offers an easier path for the lines of force.  Figure 12-23  shows  an instrument surrounded by a path of soft iron, which offers  very little opposition to magnetic flux. The lines of force  take the easier path, the path of greater permeability, and are  guided away from the instrument.  

Materials such as soft iron and other ferrous metals are  said to have a high permeability, the measure of the ease  with which magnetic flux can penetrate a material. The  permeability scale is based on a perfect vacuum with a  rating of one. Air and other nonmagnetic materials are so  close to this that they are also considered to have a rating  of one. The nonferrous metals with a permeability greater  than one, such as nickel and cobalt, are called paramagnetic.  The term ferromagnetic is applied to iron and its alloys,  which have by far the greatest permeability. Any substance,  such as bismuth, having a permeability of less than one, is  considered diamagnetic.  

Reluctance, the measure of opposition to the lines of force  through a material, can be compared to the resistance of an  electrical circuit. The reluctance of soft iron, for instance, is  much lower than that of air.  Figure 12-24  demonstrates that a  piece of soft iron placed near the field of a magnet can distort  the lines of force, which follow the path of lowest reluctance  through the soft iron.  

The magnetic circuit can be compared in many respects  to an electrical circuit. The magnetomotive force, causing  lines of force in the magnetic circuit, can be compared to  the electromotive force (emf) or electrical pressure of an  electrical circuit. The magnetomotive force is measured in  gilberts, symbolized by the capital letter “F.” The symbol for  the intensity of the lines of force, or flux, is the Greek letter  phi, and the unit of field intensity is the gauss. An individual  line of force, called a maxwell, in an area of one square  centimeter produces a field intensity of one gauss. Using  reluctance rather than permeability, the law for magnetic  circuits can be stated: a magnetomotive force of one gilbert  causes one maxwell, or line of force, to be set up in a material  when the reluctance of the material is one.  

# Types of Magnets  

Magnets are either natural or artificial. Since naturally  occurring magnets or lodestones have no practical use, all  magnets considered in this chapter are artificial or manmade.  Artificial magnets can be further classified as permanent  magnets, which retain their magnetism long after the  magnetizing force has been removed, and temporary magnets,  which quickly lose most of their magnetism when the external  magnetizing force is removed.

Figure 12-20.   Bypassing flux lines.  

Modern permanent magnets are made of special alloys that  have been found through research to create increasingly  better magnets. The most common categories of magnet  materials are made out of aluminum-nickel-cobalt  (alnicos), strontium-iron (ferrites, also known as ceramics),  neodymium-iron-boron (neo magnets), and samarium- cobalt. Alnico, an alloy of iron, aluminum, nickel and  cobalt, is considered one of the very best. Others with  excellent magnetic qualities are alloys such as Remalloy™  and Permendur™.  

The ability of a magnet to hold its magnetism varies greatly  with the type of metal and is known as retentivity. Magnets  made of soft iron are very easily magnetized but quickly  lose most of their magnetism when the external magnetizing  force is removed. The small amount of magnetism remaining,  called residual magnetism, is of great importance in such  electrical applications as generator operation.  

Horseshoe magnets are commonly manufactured in two forms.  [Figure 12-25]  The most common type is made from a long  bar curved into a horseshoe shape, while a variation of this  type consists of two bars connected by a third bar, or yoke.  

Magnets can be made in many different shapes, such as balls,  cylinders, or disks. One special type of magnet is the ring  magnet, or Gramme ring, often used in instruments. This is  a closed loop magnet, similar to the type used in transformer  cores, and is the only type that has no poles.

Sometimes special applications require that the field of force  lie through the thickness rather than the length of a piece of  metal. Such magnets are called flat magnets and are used as  pole pieces in generators and motors.

# Electromagnetism  

In 1820, the Danish physicist, Hans Christian Oersted,  discovered that the needle of a compass brought near a current  carrying conductor would be deflected. When the current flow  stopped, the compass needle returned to its original position.  This important discovery demonstrated a relationship between  electricity and magnetism that led to the electromagnet and to  many of the inventions on which modern industry is based.  

Oersted discovered that the magnetic field had no connection  with the conductor in which the electrons were flowing,  because the conductor was made of nonmagnetic copper. The  electrons moving through the wire created the magnetic field  around the conductor. Since a magnetic field accompanies a  charged particle, the greater the current flow, the greater the  magnetic field.  Figure 12-26 i llustrates the magnetic field  around a current carrying wire. A series of concentric circles  around the conductor represent the field, which if all the lines  were shown would appear more as a continuous cylinder of  such circles around the conductor.  

As long as current flows in the conductor, the lines of force  remain around it.  [Figure 12-27]  If a small current flows  through the conductor, there will be a line of force extending  out to circle A. If the current flow is increased, the line of  force increases in size to circle B, and a further increase in  current expands it to circle C. As the original line (circle) of  force expands from circle A to B, a new line of force appears  at circle A. As the current flow increases, the number of  circles of force increases, expanding the outer circles farther  from the surface of the current carrying conductor.  

If the current flow is a steady nonvarying direct current, the  magnetic field remains stationary. When the current stops,  the magnetic field collapses and the magnetism around the  conductor disappears.  

A compass needle is used to demonstrate the direction of  the magnetic field around a current carrying conductor.  Figure 12-28A  shows a compass needle positioned at right  

![](images/95ca25200185d994c2041638507c13409c2986b4ca2b3c61d4a89645c59df2c6.jpg)

angles to, and approximately one inch from, a current  carrying conductor. If no current were flowing, the North  seeking end of the compass needle would point toward the  earth’s magnetic pole. When current flows, the needle lines  itself up at right angles to a radius drawn from the conductor.  Since the compass needle is a small magnet, with lines of  force extending from South to North inside the metal, it turns  until the direction of these lines agrees with the direction  of the lines of force around the conductor. As the compass  needle is moved around the conductor, it maintains itself in  a position at right angles to the conductor, indicating that the  magnetic field around a current carrying conductor is circular.  As shown in  Figure 12-28B , when the direction of current  flow through the conductor is reversed, the compass needle  points in the opposite direction, indicating the magnetic field  has reversed its direction.  

A method used to determine the direction of the lines of force  when the direction of the current flow is known is shown in  Figure 12-29 . If the conductor is grasped in the left hand,  with the thumb pointing in the direction of current flow, the  fingers will be wrapped around the conductor in the same  direction as the lines of the magnetic field. This is called the  left-hand rule.  

Although it has been stated that the lines of force have direction,  this should not be construed to mean that the lines have motion  in a circular direction around the conductor. Although the  lines of force tend to act in a clockwise or counterclockwise  direction, they are not revolving around the conductor.  

Since current flows from negative to positive, many  illustrations indicate current direction with a dot symbol  on the end of the conductor when the electrons are flowing  toward and a plus sign when the current is flowing away  from the observer.  [Figure 12-30]  

When a wire is bent into a loop and an electric current flows  through it, the left-hand rule remains valid.  [Figure 12-31] If the wire is coiled into two loops, many of the lines of force  become large enough to include both loops. Lines of force  

![](images/4c2024ef63842bb21fd6e7dbe76286324f2d88cd6e09fb5825b9dc58e889ad13.jpg)  
Figure 12-25.   Two forms of horseshoe magnets.  

go through the loops in the same direction, circle around the  outside of the two coils, and come in at the opposite end.  [Figure 12-32]  

When a wire contains many such loops, it is called a coil. The  lines of force form a pattern through all the loops causing  a high concentration of flux lines through the center of the  coil.  [Figure 12-33]  

In a coil made from loops of a conductor, many of the  lines of force are dissipated between the loops of the coil.  By placing a soft iron bar inside the coil, the lines of force  are concentrated in the center of the coil, since soft iron  has a greater permeability than air.  [Figure 12-34]  This  combination of an iron core in a coil of wire loops, or turns,  is called an electromagnet, since the poles (ends) of the coil  possess the characteristics of a bar magnet.  

![](images/27e42b86ff79958e2e3490ae4132e08dc7c6634661994d11e4a2829cfd28cfdf.jpg)

Figure 12-27.   Expansion of magnetic field as current increases.  

The addition of the soft iron core does two things for the  current carrying coil. First, the magnetic flux is increased.  Second, the flux lines are more highly concentrated.  

When direct current flows through the coil, the core becomes  magnetized with the same polarity (location of North and  South poles) as the coil would have without the core. If the  current is reversed, the polarity is also reversed.  

The polarity of the electromagnet is determined by the  left-hand rule in the same manner as the polarity of the  coil without the core was determined. If the coil is grasped  in the left hand in such a manner that the fingers curve

around the coil in the direction of electron flow (minus to  plus), the thumb points in the direction of the North pole.  [Figure 12-35]  

The strength of the magnetic field of the electromagnet  can be increased by either increasing the flow of current or  the number of loops in the wire. Doubling the current flow  approximately doubles the strength of the field. In a similar  manner, doubling the number of loops approximately doubles  magnetic field strength. Finally, the type of metal in the core  is a factor in the field strength of the electromagnet.  

A soft iron bar is attracted to either pole of a permanent  magnet and, likewise, is attracted by a current carrying coil.  The lines of force extend through the soft iron, magnetizing  it by induction and pulling the iron bar toward the coil. If  the bar is free to move, it is drawn into the coil to a position  near the center where the field is strongest.  [Figure 12-36]  

Electromagnets are used in electrical instruments, motors,  generators, relays, and other devices. Some electromagnetic  devices operate on the principle that an iron core held away  from the center of a coil is rapidly pulled into a center position  when the coil is energized. This principle is used in the  solenoid, also called solenoid switch or relay, in which the  iron core is spring-loaded off center and moves to complete  a circuit when the coil is energized.

# Conventional Flow & Electron Flow  

Today’s technician will find that there are two competing  schools of thought and analytical practices regarding the flow  of electricity. The two are called the conventional current  theory and the electron theory.  

# Conventional Flow  

Of the two, the conventional current theory was the first to  be developed and, through many years of use, this method  has become ingrained in electrical publications. The theory  was initially advanced by Benjamin Franklin who reasoned  that current flowed out of a positive source into a negative  source or an area that lacked an abundance of charge. The  notation assigned to the electric charges was positive   $(+)$  for the abundance of charge and negative   $(-)$   for a lack of  charge. It then seemed natural to visualize the flow of current  as being from the positive  $(+)$   to the negative  $(-)$  .  

# Electron Flow  

Later discoveries were made that proved just the opposite  is true. Electron flow is what actually happens when an  abundance of electrons flow out of the negative  $(-)$   source  to an area that lacks electrons or the positive  $(+)$   source. Both  conventional flow and electron flow are used in industry.  Many publications in current use employ both electron flow  and conventional flow methods. From the practical standpoint  of the technician troubleshooting a system, it makes little  to no difference which way current is flowing as long as it  is used consistently in the analysis. The Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) officially defines current flow using  electron theory (negative to positive).  

# Electromotive Force (Voltage)  

Unlike current, which is easy to visualize as a flow, voltage  is a variable that is determined between two points. Often,  we refer to voltage as a value across two points. It is the  electromotive force (emf) or the push or pressure felt in a

conductor that ultimately moves the electrons in a flow. The  symbol for emf is the capital letter “E.”  

Across the terminals of the typical aircraft battery, voltage  can be measured as the potential difference of 12 volts or  24 volts. That is to say that between the two terminal posts  of the battery, there is an emf of 12 or 24 volts available to  push current through a circuit. Relatively free electrons in  the negative terminal move toward the excessive number  of positive charges in the positive terminal. Recall from the  discussion on static electricity that like charges repel each  other but opposite charges attract each other. The net result  is a flow or current through a conductor. There cannot be a  flow in a conductor unless there is an applied voltage from  a battery, generator, or ground power unit. The potential  difference, or the voltage across any two points in an electrical  system, can be determined by:  

Where  

$$
\mathrm{E}={\frac{\mathcal{E}}{Q}}
$$  

$\mathrm{E}=$   Potential difference in volts  $\varepsilon\!=$  Energy expanded or absorbed in joules (J)  $\mathrm{Q}=$  Charge measured in coulombs  

Figure 12-37  illustrates the flow of electrons of electric  current. Two interconnected water tanks demonstrate that

Figure 12-36.   Solenoid with iron core.  

when a difference of pressure exists between the two tanks,  water flows until the two tanks are equalized. The illustration  shows the level of water in tank A to be at a higher level,  reading 10 psi (higher potential energy) than the water level  in tank B, reading 2 psi (lower potential energy). Between  the two tanks, there is 8-psi potential difference. If the valve  in the interconnecting line between the tanks is opened,  water flows from tank A into tank B until the level of water  (potential energy) of both tanks is equalized. It is important  to note that it was not the pressure in tank A that caused the  water to flow; rather, it was the difference in pressure between  tank A and tank B that caused the flow.  

This comparison illustrates the principle that electrons move,  when a path is available, from a point of excess electrons 

 (higher potential energy) to a point deficient in electrons 

 (lower potential energy). The force that causes this movement  is the potential difference in electrical energy between the  two points. This force is called the electrical pressure or  the potential difference or the electromotive force (electron  moving force).  

# Current  

Electrons in motion make up an electric current. This electric  current is usually referred to as “current” or “current flow,”  no matter how many electrons are moving. Current is a  measurement of a rate at which a charge flows through some  region of space or a conductor. The moving charges are the  free electrons found in conductors, such as copper, silver,  aluminum, and gold. The term “free electron” describes a  condition in some atoms where the outer electrons are loosely  bound to their parent atom. These loosely bound electrons  can be easily motivated to move in a given direction when  an external source, such as a battery, is applied to the circuit.  These electrons are attracted to the positive terminal of the  battery, while the negative terminal is the source of the  electrons. The greater amount of charge moving through the  conductor in a given amount of time translates into a current.  

$$
{\mathrm{Current}}\!=\!{\frac{\mathrm{charge}}{\mathrm{Time}}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{t}}}
$$  

Where:  $\mathrm{I}=$  current in amperes (A)  $\mathrm{Q}=$   charge in coulombs (C)  $\mathrm{T}=$   time  

# Ohm’s Law (Resistance)  

The System International (SI) unit for current is the ampere  (A), where  

$$
1\mathbf{A}=1\,{\frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{s}}}
$$  

One ampere (A) of current is equivalent to 1 coulomb (C)  of charge passing through a conductor in 1 second. One  coulomb of charge equals 6.28 billion electrons. The symbol  used to indicate current in formulas or on schematics is the  capital letter “I.”  

When current flow is one direction, it is called direct  current (DC). Later in the handbook, the form of current  that periodically oscillates back and forth within the circuit  is discussed. The present discussion is only concerned with  the use of DC.  

The velocity of the charge is actually an average velocity  and is called drift velocity. To understand the idea of drift  velocity, think of a conductor in which the charge carriers  are free electrons. These electrons are always in a state of  random motion similar to that of gas molecules. When a  voltage is applied across the conductor, an emf creates an  electric field within the conductor and a current is established.  The electrons do not move in a straight direction but undergo  repeated collisions with other nearby atoms. These collisions  usually knock other free electrons from their atoms, and  these electrons move on toward the positive end of the  conductor with an average velocity called the drift velocity,  which is relatively a slow speed. To understand the nearly  instantaneous speed of the effect of the current, it is helpful  to visualize a long tube filled with steel balls as shown in  Figure 12-38 . It can be seen that a ball introduced in one end  of the tube, which represents the conductor, will immediately  cause a ball to be emitted at the opposite end of the tube.  Thus, electric current can be viewed as instantaneous, even  though it is the result of a relatively slow drift of electrons.

Figure 12-37.   Difference of pressure.  

The two fundamental properties of current and voltage  are related by a third property known as resistance. In any  electrical circuit, when voltage is applied to it, a current  results. The resistance of the conductor determines the  amount of current that flows under the given voltage. In most  cases, the greater the circuit resistance, the less the current.  If the resistance is reduced, then the current increases. This  relation is linear in nature and is known as Ohm’s Law.  

By having a linearly proportional characteristic, it is meant  that if one unit in the relationship increases or decreases by  a certain percentage, the other variables in the relationship  increase or decrease by the same percentage. An example  would be if the voltage across a resistor is doubled, then  the current through the resistor doubles. It should be added  that this relationship is true only if the resistance in the  circuit remains constant. If the resistance changes, current  also changes. A graph of this relationship is shown in  Figure 12-39 , which uses a constant resistance of  $20\Omega$  . The  relationship between voltage and current in this example  shows voltage plotted horizontally along the X axis in values  from 0 to 120 volts, and the corresponding values of current  are plotted vertically in values from 0 to 6.0 amperes along  the Y axis. A straight line drawn through all the points where  the voltage and current lines meet represents the equation I   $=\mathbb{E}_{20}$   and is called a linear relationship.  

$$
\mathrm{If}\qquad\mathrm{E}=10\;\mathrm{V}
$$  

$$
\frac{10\;\mathrm{V}}{20\;\Omega}=0.5\:\mathrm{A}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{E}=60\;\mathrm{V}
$$  

$$
\frac{60\;\mathrm{V}}{20\;\Omega}=3\;\mathrm{A}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{E}=120\;\mathrm{V}
$$  

Ohm’s Law may be expressed as an equation, as follows:  

Equation 1  $\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}}}$   $\mathrm{I}=$   current in amperes (A)  $\mathrm{E}=$   voltage (V)  ${\bf R}={\bf\rho}$   resistance   $(\Omega)$  

Where I is current in amperes, E is the potential difference  measured in volts, and R is the resistance measured in ohms.  

If any two of these circuit quantities are known, the third  may be found by simple algebraic transposition. With this  equation, we can calculate current in a circuit if the voltage  and resistance are known. This same formula can be used to  calculate voltage. By multiplying both sides of the equation  1 by R, we get an equivalent form of Ohm’s Law, which is:  

Equation 2   $\mathrm{E=I\left(R\right)}$  

Finally, if we divide equation 2 by I, we solve for resistance,  This relationship is true only if the resistance in the  circuit remains constant. If the resistance changes, current  also changes. A graph of this relationship is shown in  Figure 12-39 , which uses a constant resistance of  $20\Omega$  . The  relationship between voltage and current in this example  shows voltage plotted horizontally along the X axis in values  from 0 to 120 volts. The corresponding values of current are  plotted vertically in values from 0 to 6.0 amperes along the  Y axis. A straight line drawn through all the points where the  voltage and current lines meet represents the equation  $\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{E}/_{20}$  and is called a linear relationship.  

Equation 3  

$$
{\bf R}\,{=}\,\frac{\mathrm{~E~}}{\mathrm{~I~}}
$$  

All three formulas presented in this section are equivalent  to each other and are simply different ways of expressing  Ohm’s Law.  

The various equations, which may be derived by transposing  the basic law, can be easily obtained by using the triangles  in  Figure 12-40 .  

The triangles containing E, R, and I are divided into two  parts, with E above the line and  $\mathrm{I}\times\mathrm{R}$   below it. To determine  an unknown circuit quantity when the other two are known,  cover the unknown quantity with a thumb. The location of  the remaining uncovered letters in the triangle indicate the  mathematical operation to be performed. For example, to find  I, refer to  Figure 12-40A , and cover I with the thumb. The  uncovered letters indicate that E is to be divided by R, or  $\mathrm{I}=$  E ⁄ . To find R, refer to  Figure 12-40B , and cover R with the  R thumb. The result indicates that E is to be divided by I, or R

$=\mathrm{\DeltaE/}_{\mathrm{I}.}$  . To find E, refer to  Figure 12-40C , and cover E with the  thumb. The result indicates I is to be multiplied by R, or  $\mathrm{E}=$   $\mathrm{~I~}\!\times\!\mathrm{~R~}$  . This chart is useful when learning to use Ohm’s Law.  It should be used to supplement the beginner’s knowledge  of the algebraic method.  

# Resistance of a Conductor  

While wire of any size or resistance value may be used, the  word “conductor” usually refers to materials that offer low  resistance to current flow, and the word “insulator” describes  materials that offer high resistance to current. There is no  distinct dividing line between conductors and insulators; under  the proper conditions, all types of material conduct some  current. Materials offering a resistance to current flow midway  between the best conductors and the poorest conductors  (insulators) are sometimes referred to as “semiconductors,”  and find their greatest application in the field of transistors.  

The best conductors are materials, chiefly metals, which  possess a large number of free electrons; conversely,  insulators are materials having few free electrons. The best  conductors are silver, copper, gold, and aluminum; but  some nonmetals, such as carbon and water, can be used as  conductors. Materials such as rubber, glass, ceramics, and  plastics are such poor conductors that they are usually used  as insulators. The current flow in some of these materials  is so low that it is usually considered zero. The unit used  to measure resistance is called the ohm. The symbol for the  ohm is the Greek letter omega  $(\Omega)$  . In mathematical formulas,  the capital letter “R” refers to resistance. The resistance of a  conductor and the voltage applied to it determine the number  of amperes of current flowing through the conductor. Thus,  1 ohm of resistance limits the current flow to 1 ampere in a  conductor to which a voltage of 1 volt is applied.  

# Factors Affecting Resistance  

1.	 The resistance of a metallic conductor is dependent on  the type of conductor material. It has been pointed out  that certain metals are commonly used as conductors  because of the large number of free electrons in their  outer orbits. Copper is usually considered the best  available conductor material, since a copper wire of a  particular diameter offers a lower resistance to current  flow than an aluminum wire of the same diameter.  However, aluminum is much lighter than copper, and  for this reason, as well as cost considerations, aluminum  is often used when the weight factor is important.  

2.	 The resistance of a metallic conductor is directly  proportional to its length. The longer the length  of a given size of wire, the greater the resistance.  Figure 12-41  shows two wire conductors of different  lengths. If 1 volt of electrical pressure is applied across  

![](images/a36fb734d112e2d87830aeed6ce546105e13f8672d27750f934df52992ebbd75.jpg)  
Figure 12-39.   Voltage vs. current in a constant-resistance circuit.  

the two ends of the conductor that is 1 foot in length,  and the resistance to the movement of free electrons  is assumed to be 1 ohm, the current flow is limited  to 1 ampere. If the same size conductor is doubled in  length, the same electrons set in motion by the 1 volt  applied now find twice the resistance; consequently,  the current flow is reduced by one-half.  

3.	 The resistance of a metallic conductor is inversely  proportional to the cross-sectional area. This area may  be triangular or even square, but is usually circular.  If the cross-sectional area of a conductor is doubled,  the resistance to current flow is reduced in half. This  is true because of the increased area in which an  electron can move without collision or capture by an  atom. Thus, the resistance varies inversely with the  cross-sectional area of a conductor.  

4.	 The fourth major factor influencing the resistance of a  conductor is temperature. Although some substances,  such as carbon, show a decrease in resistance as the  ambient (surrounding) temperature increases, most  materials used as conductors increase in resistance as  temperature increases. The resistance of a few alloys,  such as constantan and Manganin™, change very little  as the temperature changes. The amount of increase in  the resistance of a 1 ohm sample of a conductor, per  degree rise in temperature above  $0^{\circ}$   Centigrade (C), the  assumed standard, is called the temperature coefficient  of resistance. For each metal, this is a different value.  For example, for copper the value is approximately  

![](images/90e44c554080ed30dac56a167202d5a26aa2655270f1b7d9d77317a38550a7a1.jpg)  
Figure 12-40.   Ohm’s law chart.  

0.00427 ohm. Thus, a copper wire having a resistance  of 50 ohms at a temperature of   $0\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   has an increase  in resistance of   $50\times0.00427$  , or 0.214 ohm, for each  degree rise in temperature above  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The temperature  coefficient of resistance must be considered where there  is an appreciable change in temperature of a conductor  during operation. Charts listing the temperature  coefficient of resistance for different materials are  available.  Figure 12-42  shows a table for “resistivity”  of some common electric conductors.  

The resistance of a material is determined by four properties:  material, length, area, and temperature. The first three  properties are related by the following equation at  $\mathrm{T}\,{=}\,20\;^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (room temperature):  

$$
\mathrm{R}={\frac{(\uprho\times1)}{\mathrm{A}}}
$$  

Where  

${\bf R}={\bf\rho}$   resistance in ohms  $\uprho=$   resistivity of the material in circular mil-ohms per foot  $1\,{=}$  length of the sample in feet  $\mathbf{A}=$   area in circular mils  

# Resistance and Relation to Wire Sizing Circular Conductors (Wires/Cables)  

Because it is known that the resistance of a conductor is directly  proportional to its length, and if we are given the resistance of  the unit length of wire, we can readily calculate the resistance  of any length of wire of that particular material having the  same diameter. Also, because it is known that the resistance of  a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area,  and if we are given the resistance of a length of wire with unit  cross-sectional area, we can calculate the resistance of a similar  length of wire of the same material with any cross-sectional  area. Therefore, if we know the resistance of a given conductor,  we can calculate the resistance for any conductor of the same  material at the same temperature. From the relationship:  

$\mathbf{R}=\frac{(\mathsf{p}\times1)}{\mathsf{A}}$  It can also be written:  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{1}}{\mathrm{I}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{A}_{1}}{\mathrm{A}_{2}}
$$  

If we have a conductor that is 1 meter   $\mathrm{(m)}$   long with a cross- sectional area of 1 (millimeter)  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   and has a resistance of  0.017 ohm, what is the resistance of   $50\;\mathrm{m}$   of wire from the  same material but with a cross-sectional area of  $0.25~\mathrm{mm}^{2}?$  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{1}}{\mathrm{I}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{A}_{1}}{\mathrm{A}_{2}}
$$  

$$
\Omega^{2}=0.017\;\Omega\;\times\frac{50\;\mathrm{m}}{1\;\mathrm{m}}\times\frac{1\;\mathrm{mm}^{2}}{0.25\;\mathrm{mm}^{2}}=3.4\;\Omega
$$  

While the SI units are commonly used in the analysis of  electric circuits, electrical conductors in North America are  

![](images/8ddcf4d4fe42b4deed8f5f9469dbcac082c3c9319d159fbf3b3a140765a23c66.jpg)  
Figure 12-41.   Resistance varies with length of conductor.  

still being manufactured using the foot as the unit length and  the mil (one thousandth of an inch) as the unit of diameter.  Before using the equation  $\mathrm{{R}=(\mathsf{p}\times\mathrm{{l}})/_{\mathrm{{A}}}}$   to calculate the resistance  of a conductor of a given American wire gauge (AWG) size,  the cross-sectional area in square meters must be determined  using the conversion factor   $1~{\mathrm{mil}}=0.0254~{\mathrm{mm}}$  . The most  convenient unit of wire length is the foot. Using these  standards, the unit of size is the mil-foot. Thus, a wire has  unit size if it has a diameter of 1 mil and length of 1 foot.  

In the case of using copper conductors, we are spared the  task of tedious calculations by using a table as shown in  Figure 12-43 . Note that cross-sectional dimensions listed on  the table are such that each decrease of one gauge number  equals a 25 percent increase in the cross-sectional area.  Because of this, a decrease of three gauge numbers represents  an increase in cross-sectional area of approximately 2:1.  Likewise, change of ten wire gauge numbers represents a 10:1  change in cross-sectional area—also, by doubling the cross- sectional area of the conductor, the resistance is cut in half.  A decrease of three wire gauge numbers cuts the resistance  of the conductor of a given length in half.  

# Rectangular Conductors (Bus Bars)  

To compute the cross-sectional area of a conductor in square  mils, the length in mils of one side is squared. In the case of a  rectangular conductor, the length of one side is multiplied by  the length of the other. For example, a common rectangular  bus bar (large, special conductor) is  $\%$   inch thick and 4 inches  wide. The   $\%$  -inch thickness may be expressed as 0.375  inch. Since 1,000 mils equal 1 inch, the width in inches can  be converted to   $4{,}000~\mathrm{cells}$  . The cross-sectional area of the  rectangular conductor is found by converting 0.375 to mils   $(375~\mathrm{cells}\times4\small{,}000~\mathrm{cells}=1\small{,}500\small{,}000$   square mils).  

# Power and Energy  

# Power in an Electrical Circuit  

This section covers power in the DC circuit and energy  consumption. Whether referring to mechanical or electrical  systems, power is defined as the rate of energy consumption  

![](images/e6fab2d6a6e06ec74d975762c86ec67e150f2f553ad18378c256e1da80848295.jpg)  
Figure 12-42.   Resistivity table.  

or conversion within that system—that is, the amount of  energy used or converted in a given amount of time.  

From the scientific discipline of physics, the fundamental  expression for power is:  

$$
\mathbf{P}=\frac{\pmb{\mathcal{E}}}{\mathbf{t}}
$$  

Where  $\mathbf{P}=$   power measured in watts (W)  $\varepsilon\!=$   energy (  $\varepsilon$   is a script E) measured in joules (J) and  $\mathbf{t}=$   time measured in seconds (s)  

The unit measurement for power is the watt (W), which refers  to a rate of energy conversion of 1 joule (J)/second. Therefore,  the number of joules consumed in 1 second is equal to the  number of watts. A simple example is given below.  

Suppose 300 joules of energy is consumed in 10 seconds.  What would be the power in watts?  

$$
\mathrm{{Geigeral\formula\}\ P=\frac{e n e r g y}{t i m e}\ }\\ {\mathrm{P=\frac{300\Delta J}{10\;s}}}\\ {\mathrm{P=30\;W}}\end{array}
$$  

The watt is named for James Watt, the inventor of the steam  engine. Watt devised an experiment to measure the power of  a horse in order to find a means of measuring the mechanical  power of his steam engine. One horsepower is required to  move 33,000 pounds 1 foot in 1 minute. Since power is the  rate of doing work, it is equivalent to the work divided by  time. Stated as a formula, this is:  

$$
\mathrm{Power}\,{=}\,\frac{33\mathrm{,}000\;\mathrm{ft{-}l b}}{60\;\mathrm{s}}
$$  

P = 550 ft-lb/s  

Electrical power can be rated in a similar manner. For  example, an electric motor rated as a 1 horsepower motor  requires 746 watts of electrical energy.  

# Power Formulas Used in the Study of Electricity  

When current flows through a resistive circuit, energy is  dissipated in the form of heat. Recall that voltage can be  expressed in the terms of energy and charge as given in the  expression:  

$$
\mathrm{E}={\frac{\mathcal{E}}{Q}}
$$  

Where  

![Figure 12-43.   Conversion table when using copper conductors. ](images/d605673d79f7eec71b030f4eb43193d713370fa05ef5fe960a5db3091b832742.jpg)  

$\mathrm{E}=$   potential difference in volts  $\varepsilon\!=$   energy expanded or absorbed in joules (J)  $\mathrm{Q}=$  charge measured in coulombs  

Current I, can also be expressed in terms of charge and time  as given by the expression:  

${\mathrm{Current}}={\frac{\mathrm{charge}}{\mathrm{Time}}}$                      or 	  $\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{T}}}$  Where:  $\mathrm{I}=$  current in amperes (A)  $\mathrm{Q}=$   charge in coulombs (C)  $\mathrm{T}=$   time  

When voltage   $\mathcal{W}_{\mathrm{Q}}$   and current  $\mathrm{\mathrm{{\%}}}$   are multiplied, the charge  Q is divided out leaving the basic expression from physics:  

$$
\mathrm{E}\times\mathrm{I}={\frac{\pmb{\mathcal{E}}}{\mathrm{Q}}}\times{\frac{\pmb{\mathcal{E}}}{\mathrm{t}}}={\frac{\pmb{\mathcal{E}}}{\mathrm{t}}}=\mathrm{power}
$$  

For a simple DC electrical system, power dissipation  

# Power in a Series & Parallel Circuit  

General Power Formula 	   ${\bf P}={\bf I}\left(\mathrm{E}\right)$  

Where 	  $\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{P}\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{w}\mathbf{e r}}\\ &{\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{C u r r e n t}}\\ &{\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{V}\mathbf{ol}\mathbf{t}\mathbf{s}}\end{array}$  

If a circuit has a known voltage of 24 volts and a current of  2 amps, then the power in the circuit is:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{I}\left(\mathrm{E}\right)}\\ {\mathrm{P}=2\mathrm{A}\left(24\mathrm{V}\right)}\\ {\mathrm{P}=48\mathrm{W}}\end{array}
$$  

Now recall Ohm’s Laws that state   $\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{R})$  . If we now  substitute IR for E in the general formula, we get a formula  that uses only current I and resistance   $\mathrm{R}$   to determine the  power in a circuit.  

$$
{\bf P}={\bf I}\left({\bf I}{\bf R}\right)
$$  

Second Form of Power Equation  

$$
{\mathbf{P}}=\mathrm{I}^{2}{\mathbf{R}}
$$  

If a circuit has a known current of 2 amps and a resistance  of   $100\,{\Omega}$  , then the power in the circuit is:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{I}^{2}\mathrm{R}}\\ {\mathrm{P}=(2\mathrm{A})^{2}\,100\,\Omega}\\ {\mathrm{P}=400\;\mathrm{W}}\end{array}
$$  

Using Ohm’s Law, which can be stated as  $\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{E}{\sqrt{\mathrm{_{R}}}}$  , we can again  make a substitution such that power can be determined by  knowing only the voltage (E) and resistance (R) of the circuit.  

$$
\mathrm{P={\binom{E}{R}}(E)}
$$  

Third Form of Power Equation  

$$
\mathbf{P}=\,{\frac{\mathrm{E}^{2}}{\mathrm{R}}}
$$  

If a circuit has a known voltage of 24 volts and a resistance  of   $20\;\Omega$  , then the power in the circuit is:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\mathbf{P}=\frac{\mathbf{E}^{2}}{\mathbf{R}}}\\ {\displaystyle\mathbf{P}=\frac{(24\,\mathbf{V})^{2}}{20\,\Omega}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{P}=28.8~\mathrm{W}
$$  

The total power dissipated in both a series and parallel circuit  is equal to the sum of the power dissipated in each resistor  in the circuit. Power is simply additive and can be stated as:  

$$

# Energy in an Electrical Circuit  

Energy is defined as the ability to do work. Because power  is the rate of energy usage, power used over a span of time  is actually energy consumption. If power and time are  multiplied together, we get energy.  

The joule is defined as a unit of energy. There is another unit  of measure which is perhaps more familiar. Because power  is expressed in watts and time in seconds, a unit of energy  can be called a watt-second (Ws) or more recognizable from  the electric bill, a kilowatt-hour (kWh). Refer to Chapter 5,  Physics,   for further discussion on energy.  

# Sources of Electricity  

Electrical energy can be produced in a number of methods. The  four most common are pressure, chemical, thermal, and light.  

# Pressure Source  

This form of electrical generation is commonly known as  piezoelectric (piezo or piez taken from Greek: to press;  pressure; to squeeze) is a result of the application of  mechanical pressure on a dielectric or non-conducting crystal.  The most common piezoelectric materials used today are  crystalline quartz and Rochelle salt. However, Rochelle salt is  being superseded by other materials, such as barium titanate.  

The application of a mechanical stress produces an electric  polarization, which is proportional to this stress. This  polarization establishes a voltage across the crystal. If a  circuit is connected across the crystal, a flow of current can  be observed when the crystal is loaded (pressure is applied).  An opposite condition can occur, where an application of a  voltage between certain faces of the crystal can produce a  mechanical distortion. This effect is commonly referred to  as the piezoelectric effect.  

Piezoelectric materials are used extensively in transducers  for converting a mechanical strain into an electrical signal.  Such devices include microphones, phonograph pickups, and  vibration-sensing elements. The opposite effect, in which a  mechanical output is derived from an electrical signal input,  is also widely used in headphones and loudspeakers.  

# Chemical Source  

Chemical energy can be converted into electricity; the  most common form of this is the battery. A primary battery  produces electricity using two different metals in a chemical  solution like alkaline electrolyte, where a chemical reaction  between the metals and the chemicals frees more electrons  in one metal than in the other. One terminal of the battery is  attached to one of the metals, such as zinc; the other terminal  is attached to the other metal, such as manganese oxide. The  end that frees more electrons develops a positive charge  and the other end develops a negative charge. If a wire is  attached from one end of the battery to the other, electrons  flow through the wire to balance the electrical charge.  

# Thermal Sources  

The most common source of thermal electricity found in the  aviation industry comes from thermocouples. Thermocouples  are widely used as temperature sensors. They are cheap  and interchangeable, have standard connectors, and can  measure a wide range of temperatures. Thermocouples  are pairs of dissimilar metal wires joined at least at one  end, which generate a voltage between the two wires that  is proportional to the temperature at the junction. This is  called the Seebeck effect, in honor of Thomas Seebeck who  first noticed the phenomena in 1821. It was also noticed  that different metal combinations have a different voltage  difference. Thermocouples are used to measure cylinder head  temperatures and Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT).  

# Light Sources  

A solar cell or a photovoltaic cell is a device that converts

Figure 12-44.   Ohm’s Law formula.  

light energy into electricity. Fundamentally, the device  contains certain chemical elements that, when exposed to  light energy, release electrons.  

Photons in sunlight are taken in by the solar panel or cell,  where they are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such  as silicon. Electrons in the cell are broken loose from their  atoms, allowing them to flow through the material to produce  electricity. The complementary positive charges that are also  created are called holes (absence of electron) and flow in the  direction opposite of the electrons in a silicon solar panel.  

Solar cells have many applications and have historically been  used in earth orbiting satellites or space probes, handheld  calculators, and wrist watches.  

# Schematic Representation of Electrical  Components  

The schematic is the most common place where the technician  finds electronic symbols. The schematic is a diagram that  depicts the interconnection and logic of an electronic or  electrical circuit. Many symbols are employed for use in  the schematic drawings, blueprints, and illustrations. This  section briefly outlines some of the more common symbols  and explains how to interpret them.  

# Conductors  

The schematic depiction of a conductor is simple enough.  This is generally shown as a solid line. However, the line  types may vary depending on who drew the schematics and  what exactly the line represents. While the solid line is used  to depict the wire or conductor, schematics used for aircraft  modifications can also use other line types, such as a dashed  to represent “existing” wires prior to modification and solid  lines for “new” wires.  

There are two methods employed to show wire crossovers  and wire connections.  Figure 12-45  shows the two methods  of drawing wires that cross: version A and version B.  Figure 12-46  shows the two methods for drawing wire  that connect version A and version B. If version A in  Figure 12-45  is used to depict crossovers, then version A for  wire connections in  Figure 12-46  is used. The same can then  be said about the use of version B methods. The technician  encounters both in common use.  

Figure 12-47  shows a few examples of the more common  wire types that the technician encounters in schematics. They  are the single wire, single shielded, shielded twisted pair or  double, and the shielded triple. This is not an exhaustive list of  wire types but a fair representation of how they are depicted.  Figure 12-47  also shows the wires having a wire number.  These are shown for the sake of illustration and vary from one  installation agency to another. For further understanding of a  wire numbering system, consult the appropriate wiring guide  published by the agency that drew the prints. Regardless of  the specifics of the wire numbering system, organizations  that exercise professional wiring practices have the installed  wire marked in some manner. This is an aid to the technician  who has to troubleshoot or modify the system at a later date.  

# Types of Resistors  

# Fixed Resistor  

Fixed resistors have built into the design a means of opposing  current.  [Figure 12-48]  The general use of a resistor in a  circuit is to limit the amount of current flow. There are a  number of methods used in construction and sizing of a  resistor that control properties, such as resistance value, the  precision of the resistance value, and the ability to dissipate  heat. While in some applications the purpose of the resistive  element is used to generate heat, such as in propeller anti-ice  boots, heat typically is the unwanted loss of energy.  

# Carbon Composition  

The carbon composed resistor is constructed from a mixture  of finely grouped carbon/graphite, an insulation material  for filler, and a substance for binding the material together.  The amount of graphite in relation to the insulation material  determines the ohmic or resistive value of the resistor. This  mixture is compressed into a rod, which is fitted with axial  leads or “pigtails.” The finished product is sealed in an  insulating coating for isolation and physical protection.  

There are other types of fixed resistors in common use.  Included in this group are:  

•	 Carbon film •	 Metal-oxide •	 Metal film •	 Metal glaze  

The construction of a film resistor is accomplished by  depositing a resistive material evenly on a ceramic rod. This  resistive material can be graphite for the carbon film resistor,  nickel chromium for the metal film resistor, metal and glass  for the metal glaze resistor, and metal and an insulating oxide  for the metal-oxide resistor.  

# Resistor Ratings  

# Color Code  

It is very difficult to manufacture a resistor to an exact standard  of ohmic values. Fortunately, most circuit requirements are  not extremely critical. For many uses, the actual resistance in  ohms can be 20 percent higher or lower than the value marked  on the resistor without causing difficulty. The percentage  variation between the marked value and the actual value of  a resistor is known as the “tolerance” of a resistor. A resistor  coded for a 5 percent tolerance is not more than 5 percent  higher or lower than the value indicated by the color code.  

The resistor color code is made up of a group of colors,  numbers, and tolerance values. Each color is represented by a  number, and in most cases, by a tolerance value.  [Figure 12-49]  

When the color code is used with the end-to-center band marking  system, the resistor is normally marked with bands of color at  one end of the resistor. The body or base color of the resistor  has nothing to do with the color code, and in no way indicates  a resistance value. To prevent confusion, this body is never  the same color as any of the bands indicating resistance value.

Figure 12-47.   Common wire types.  

# Color Band Decoding  

When the end-to-center band marking system is used, either  three or four bands mark the resistor.  

1.	 The first color band (nearest the end of the resistor)  indicates the first digit in the numerical resistance  value. This band is never gold or silver in color. 2.	 The second color band always indicates the second  digit of ohmic value. It is never gold or silver in color.  [Figure 12-50] 3.	 The third color band indicates the number of zeros to  be added to the two digits derived from the first and  second bands, except in the following two cases: (a)	 If the third band is gold in color, the first two  digits must be multiplied by 10 percent. (b)	 If the third band is silver in color, the first two  digits must be multiplied by 1 percent. 4.	 If there is a fourth color band, it is used as a multiplier  for percentage of tolerance, as indicated in the color  code chart in  Figure 12-49 . If there is no fourth band,  the tolerance is understood to be 20 percent.  

Figure 12-50  illustrates the rules for reading the resistance  value of a resistor marked with the end-to-center band system.  This resistor is marked with three bands of color, which must  be read from the end toward the center.  

There is no fourth color band; therefore, the tolerance is  understood to be 20 percent. 20 percent of  $250{,}000\,\Omega$  , equals   $50{,}000\,\Omega$  .  

Since the 20 percent tolerance is plus or minus,  

Maximum resistance  $=250\small{,}000\,\Omega+50\small{,}000\,\Omega$   $=300{,}000\,\Omega$  

Minimum resistance  $=250\small{,}000\,\Omega-50\small{,}000\,\Omega$   $=200{,}000\,\Omega$  

The following paragraphs provide a few extra examples of  resistor color band decoding.  Figure 12-51  contains a resistor  with another set of colors. This resistor code should be read  as follows:  

![](images/52c1d279935fc9f1c4313e0663610aea24e7c34e89abacf2fb48d28a900a2471.jpg)  
Figure 12-48.   Fixed resistor schematic.  

The resistance of this resistor is   $86{,}000\pm10\$   percent ohms.  The maximum resistance is 94,600 ohms, and the minimum  resistance is 77,400 ohms.  

Another example is the resistance of the resistor in  Figure 12-52 is   $960\pm5$   percent ohms. The maximum resistance is 1,008  ohms, and the minimum resistance is 912 ohms.  

Sometimes circuit considerations dictate that the tolerance  must be smaller than 20 percent.  Figure 12-53  shows  an example of a resistor with a 2 percent tolerance. The  resistance value of this resistor is   $2{,}500\pm2$   percent ohms.  The maximum resistance is 2,550 ohms, and the minimum  resistance is 2,450 ohms.  

Figure 12-54  contains an example of a resistor with a black  third color band. The color code value of black is zero, and  the third band indicates the number of zeros to be added to  the first two digits.  

In this case, a zero number of zeros must be added to the first  two digits; therefore, no zeros are added. Thus, the resistance  value is   $10\pm1$   percent ohms. The maximum resistance is  10.1 ohms, and the minimum resistance is 9.9 ohms. There  are two exceptions to the rule stating the third color band  indicates the number of zeros. The first of these exceptions  is illustrated in  Figure 12-55 . When the third band is gold in  color, it indicates that the first two digits must be multiplied  by 10 percent. The value of this resistor in this case is:  

$$
10\times0.10\pm2\%=1=0.02\ \mathrm{ohm}
$$  

When the third band is silver, as is the case in  Figure 12-56 ,  the first two digits must be multiplied by 1 percent. The value  

![](images/343a648579db3816cd15dd80a46b9dcae5a2e943283d7ec41d06625f034d91bd.jpg)  

# Wire-Wound  

Wire-wound resistors typically control large amounts of  current and have high power ratings. Resistors of this type are  constructed by winding a resistance wire around an insulating  rod usually made of porcelain. The windings are coated with an  insulation material for physical protection and heat conduction.  Both ends of the windings are connected to terminals, which  are used to connect the resistor to a circuit.  [Figure 12-57]  

A wire-wound resistor with tap is a special type of fixed  resistor that can be adjusted. These adjustments can be  made by moving a slide bar tap or by moving the tap to a  preset incremental position. While the tap may be adjustable,  the adjustments are usually set at the time of installation  to a specific value and then operated in service as a fixed  resistor. Another type of wire-wound resistor is constructed  of Manganin wire, used when high precision is needed.  

# Variable Resistors  

Variable resistors are constructed so that the resistive value  can be changed easily. This adjustment can be manual or  automatic, and the adjustments can be made while the system  that it is connected to is in operation. There are two basic  types of manual adjustors: the rheostat and the potentiometer.  

# Rheostat  

A rheostat is a variable resistor used to vary the amount of  current flowing in a circuit.  [Figure 12-58]   Figure 12-59 shows a rheostat connected in series with an ordinary  resistance in a series circuit. As the slider arm moves  from point A to B, the amount of rheostat resistance (AB)  is increased. Since the rheostat resistance and the fixed  resistance are in series, the total resistance in the circuit also  increases, and the current in the circuit decreases. On the  other hand, if the slider arm is moved toward point A, the total  resistance decreases and the current in the circuit increases.

# Potentiometer  

The potentiometer is considered a three-terminal device.  [Figure 12-60]  As illustrated, terminals 1 and 2 have the  entire value of the potentiometer resistance between them.  Terminal 3 is the wiper or moving contact. Through this wiper,  the resistance between terminals 1 and 3 or terminals 2 and 3  can be varied. While the rheostat is used to vary the current  in a circuit, the potentiometer is used to vary the voltage in a  circuit. A typical use for this component can be found in the  volume controls on an audio panel and input devices for flight  data recorders, among many other applications.  

In  Figure 12-61A , a potentiometer is used to obtain a variable  voltage from a fixed voltage source to apply to an electrical  load. The voltage applied to the load is the voltage between  points 2 and 3. When the slider arm is moved to point 1, the  entire voltage is applied to the electrical device (load); when  the arm is moved to point 3, the voltage applied to the load  is zero. The potentiometer makes possible the application of  any voltage between zero and full voltage to the load.  

The current flowing through the circuit of  Figure 12-61 leaves the negative terminal electron flow of the battery and  divides one part flowing through the lower portion of the  potentiometer (points 3 to 2) and the other part through the  load. Both parts combine at point 2 and flow through the  upper portion of the potentiometer (points 2 to 1) back to the  positive terminal of the battery. In View B of  Figure 12-61 , a  potentiometer and its schematic symbol are shown.  

In choosing a potentiometer resistance, the amount of current  drawn by the load should be considered, as well as the current  flow through the potentiometer at all settings of the slider  arm. The energy of the current through the potentiometer is  dissipated in the form of heat.  

It is important to keep this wasted current as small as  possible by making the resistance of the potentiometer as  large as practicable. In most cases, the resistance of the  potentiometer can be several times the resistance of the load.  Figure 12-62  shows how a potentiometer can be wired to  function as a rheostat.  

# Linear Potentiometers  

In a linear potentiometer, the resistance between both terminal  and the wiper varies linearly with the position of the wiper.  To illustrate, one quarter of a turn on the potentiometer results  in one quarter of the total resistance. The same relationship  exists when one-half or three-quarters of potentiometer  movement.  [Figure 12-63]  

Tapered Potentiometers Resistance varies in a nonlinear manner in the case of the  

![](images/68f2b9fe54f6160ae502aa317ee4baf5a17e7b83df428a3205ff4ad9b76a3e7b.jpg)  
Figure 12-57.   Wire-wound resistors.  

tapered potentiometer.  [Figure 12-64]  Keep in mind that  one-half of full potentiometer travel does not necessarily  correspond to one-half the total resistance of the potentiometer.  

# Thermistors  

The thermistor is a type of a variable resistor that is  temperature sensitive.  [Figure 12-65]  This component  has a negative temperature coefficient, which means that  as the sensed temperature increases, the resistance of the  thermistor decreases.  

# Photoconductive Cells  

The photoconductive cell is similar to the thermistor. Like the  thermistor, it has a negative temperature coefficient. Unlike  the thermistor, the resistance is controlled by light intensity.  This kind of component can be found in radio control heads  where the intensity of the ambient light is sensed through  the photoconductive cell resulting in the backlighting of the  control heads to adjust to the flight deck lighting conditions.  [Figure 12-66]  

# Circuit Protection Devices  

Perhaps the most serious trouble in a circuit is a direct short.  The term “direct short” describes a situation in which some  point in the circuit, where full system voltage is present,  comes in direct contact with the ground or return side of the  circuit. This establishes a path for current flow that contains  no resistance other than that present in the wires carrying the  current, and these wires have very little resistance.  

Most wires used in aircraft electrical circuits are small  gauge, and their current carrying capacity is quite limited.  The size of the wires used in any given circuit is determined  

![](images/c4e310cac3f002003cf75963e626c1893b4e5385599b720d0f735ba92b8c76ac.jpg)

by the amount of current the wires are expected to carry  under normal operating conditions. Any current flow in  excess of normal, such as the case of a direct short, would  cause a rapid generation of heat. If the excessive current  flow caused by the short is left unchecked, the heat in the  wire could cause a portion of the wire to melt and at the  very least, open the circuit.  

To protect aircraft electrical systems from damage and failure  caused by excessive current, several kinds of protective  devices are installed in the systems. Fuses, circuit breakers,  thermal protectors, and arc fault circuit breakers are used  for this purpose.  

Circuit protective devices, as the name implies, all have a  common purpose—to protect the units and the wires in the  circuit. Some are designed primarily to protect the wiring  and to open the circuit in such a way as to stop the current  flow when the current becomes greater than the wires can  safely carry. Other devices are designed to protect a unit in  the circuit by stopping the current flow to it when the unit  becomes excessively warm.  

# Fuse  

Fuses are used to protect the circuit from over current  conditions.  [Figure 12-67A]  The fuse is installed in the circuit  so that all the current in the circuit passes through it. In most  fuses, the strip of metal is made of an alloy of tin and bismuth,  which melts and opens the circuit when the current exceeds  

![](images/e66ac3ae9845d61b84fbe23a81d63633dc114e41010df400a814e454fdca3bb6.jpg)

Figure 12-63.   Linear potentiometer schematic.  

the rated capacity of the fuse. For example, if a 5-amp fuse  is placed into a circuit, the fuse allows currents up to 5 amps  to pass. Because the fuse is intended to protect the circuit,  it is quite important that its capacity match the needs of the  circuit in which it is used.  

When replacing a fuse, consult the applicable manufacturer’s  instructions to be sure a fuse of the correct type and capacity  is installed. Fuses are installed in two types of fuse holders  in aircraft. “Plug-in holders” or in-line holders are used for  small and low capacity fuses. “Clip” type holders are used  for heavy high capacity fuses and current limiters.  

# Current Limiter  

The current limiter is very much like the fuse. However, the  current limiter link is usually made of copper and will stand  a considerable overload for a short period of time. Like the  fuse, it opens up in an over current condition in heavy current  circuits such as 30 amp or greater. These are used primarily  to sectionalize an aircraft circuit or bus. Once the limiter is  opened, it must be replaced. The schematic symbol for the  current limiter shows two triangles pointing to each other  with a line on both sides of the triangles. [ Figure 12-67B ].  

# Circuit Breaker  

The circuit breaker is commonly used in place of a fuse and is  designed to break the circuit and stop the current flow when  the current exceeds a predetermined value. Unlike the fuse,  the circuit breaker can be reset; whereas the fuse or current  limiter must be replaced.  [Figure 12-68]

Figure 12-66.   Photoconductive cell schematic symbol component.  

There are several types of circuit breakers in general use in  aircraft systems. One is a magnetic type. When excessive  current flows in the circuit, it makes an electromagnet strong  enough to move a small armature, which trips the breaker.  Another type is the thermal overload switch or breaker.  This consists of a bimetallic strip which, when it becomes  overheated from excessive current, bends away from a catch  on the switch lever and permits the switch to trip open.  

Most circuit breakers must be reset by hand. If the overload  condition still exists, the circuit breaker trips again to prevent  damage to the circuit. At this point, it is usually not advisable  to continue resetting the circuit breaker, but to initiate  troubleshooting to determine the cause. Repeated resetting  of a circuit breaker can lead to circuit or component damage  or worse, the possibility of a fire or explosion. Automatic  reset type circuit breakers are not allowed in aircraft. Circuit  breakers are commonly grouped on a circuit breaker panel that  is accessible to the flight crew.  Figure 12-69  shows a circuit  breaker and a circuit breaker panel.  

# Arc Fault Circuit Breaker  

In recent years, the arc fault circuit breaker has begun to  provide an additional layer of protection beyond that of the  thermal protection already provided by conventional circuit  breakers. The arc fault circuit breaker monitors the circuit  for an electrical arcing signature, which can indicate possible  wiring faults and unsafe conditions. These conditions can  lead to fires or loss of power to critical systems. The arc fault  circuit breaker is only beginning to make an appearance in  the aircraft industry and is not widely used like the thermal  type of circuit breaker.  

# Thermal Protectors  

A thermal protector, or switch, is used to protect a motor. It  is designed to open the circuit automatically whenever the  temperature of the motor becomes excessively high. It has  two positions—open and closed. The most common use for  a thermal switch is to keep a motor from overheating. If a  

![](images/44ca8ba539d7c590faa77421cb79c6d477d1619e20575da662a28e434781c59d.jpg)  
Figure 12-67.   Schematic symbol for fuse (A) and current limiter (B).  

malfunction in the motor causes it to overheat, the thermal  switch breaks the circuit intermittently.  

The thermal switch contains a bimetallic disk, or strip, that  bends and breaks the circuit when it is heated. This occurs  because one of the metals expands more than the other when  they are subjected to the same temperature. When the strip  or disk cools, the metals contract and the strip returns to its  original position and closes the circuit.  

# Control Devices  

Components in the electrical circuits are typically not all  intended to operate continuously or automatically. Most of  them are meant to operate at certain times, under certain  conditions, to perform very definite functions. There must  be some means of controlling their operation. Either a  switch, or a relay, or both may be included in the circuit  for this purpose.

# Switches  

Switches control the current flow in most aircraft electrical  circuits. A switch is used to start, to stop, or to change the  direction of the current flow in the circuit. The switch in  each circuit must be able to carry the normal current of the  circuit and must be insulated heavily enough for the voltage  of the circuit.  Figure 12-70  shows various switches used in  aircraft electrical systems.  

An understanding of some basic definitions of the switch is  necessary before any of the switch types are discussed. The  number of poles, throws, and positions they have designates  toggle switches, as well as some other type of switches.  

Pole—the switch’s movable blade or contactor. The number  of poles is equal to the number of circuits, or paths for  current flow, that can be completed through the switch at  any one time.  

Throw—indicates the number of circuits, or paths for current,  that it is possible to complete through the switch with each  pole or contactor.  

Positions—indicates the number of places at which the  operating device (toggle, plunger, and so forth) comes to  rest and at the same time open or close one or more circuits.  

# Toggle Switch  

Single-Pole, Single-Throw (SPST)  

The single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch allows a  connection between two contacts. One of two conditions  exist. Either the circuit is open in one position or closed in  the other position.  [Figure 12-71]  

# Single-Pole, Double-Throw (SPDT)  

The single-pole, double-throw (SPDT) switch is shown in  Figure 12-72 . With this switch, contact between one contact  can be made between one contact and the other.  

Double-Pole, Single-Throw (DPST)  

The double-pole, single-throw (DPST) switch connection  can be made between one set of contacts and either of two  other sets of contacts.  [Figure 12-73]  

# Double-Pole, Double-Throw (DPDT)  

The schematic symbol for the double-pole, double-throw  (DPDT) switch is shown in  Figure 12-74 . This type of switch  makes a connection from one set of contacts to either of two  other sets of contacts.  

A toggle switch that is spring-loaded to the OFF position  

![](images/11af18088906323ae399482d8f4a60e3b402756e3802d2dd408dcd291bb76a0b.jpg)

and must be held in the ON position to complete the circuit  is a momentary contact two-position switch. One that comes  to rest at either of two positions, opening the circuit in one  position and closing it in another, is a two-position switch. A  toggle switch that comes to rest at any one of three positions  is a three-position switch.  

A switch that stays open, except when it is held in the closed  position, is a normally open switch (usually identified as  NO). One that stays closed, except when it is held in the  open position is a normally closed switch (NC). Both kinds  are spring loaded to their normal position and return to that  position as soon as they are released.  

Locking toggles require the operator to pull out on the switch  toggle before moving it in to another position. Once in the new  position, the switch toggle is release back into a lock, which  then prevents the switch from inadvertently being moved.  

# Microswitches  

A microswitch opens or closes a circuit with a very small  movement of the tripping device ( 1 ⁄  inch or less). This is  16 what gives the switch its name, since micro means small.  

Microswitches are usually pushbutton switches. They are  used primarily as limit switches to provide automatic control  of landing gears, actuator motors, and the like.  Figure 12-75 shows a normally closed microswitch in cross-section and  illustrates how these switches operate. When the operating  plunger is pressed in, the spring and the movable contact are  pushed, opening the contacts and the circuit.  Figure 12-76 shows a pushbutton microswitch.  

# Rotary Selector Switches  

A rotary selector switch takes the place of several switches.  When the knob of the switch is rotated, the switch opens one  circuit and closes another. Ignition switches and voltmeter  selector switches are typical examples of this kind of switch.  [Figure 12-77]  

# Pushbutton Switches  

Pushbutton switches have one stationary contact and one

movable contact. The movable contact is attached to the  pushbutton. The pushbutton is either an insulator itself or is  insulated from the contact. This switch is spring loaded and  designed for momentary contact.  

# Lighted Pushbutton Switches  

Another more common switch found in today’s aircraft is  the lighted pushbutton switch. This type of switch takes the  form of a  $\%$  -inch to 1-inch cube with incandescent or LED  lights to indicate the function of the switch. Switch designs  come in a number of configurations; the two most common  are the alternate action and momentary action and usually  have a two-pole or four-pole switch body. Other less common  

![](images/991c6096b9a5dd0cbe9a3623d0310b464cf49e2e069b30d5c0df2a5f4f14ff59.jpg)

Figure 12-74.   Double-pole, double-throw switch schematic symbol.  

switch actions are the alternate and momentary holding coil  configurations. The less known holding or latching coil switch  bodies are designed to have a magnetic coil inside the switch  body that is energized through two contacts in the base of the  switch. When the coil is energized and the switch is pressed,  the switch contacts remain latched until power is removed from  the coil. This type of design allows for some degree of remote  control over the switch body.  [Figure 12-78]  

The display optics of the lighted pushbutton switch provide the  crew with a clear message that is visible under a wide range of  lighting conditions with very high luminance and wide viewing  angles. While some displays are simply a transparent screen  that is backlit by an incandescent light, the higher quality  and more reliable switches are available in sunlight readable  displays and night vision (NVIS) versions. Due to the sunlight  environment of the flight deck, displays utilizing standard  lighting techniques “washout” when viewed in direct sunlight.  Sunlight readable displays are designed to minimize this effect.  

Lighted pushbutton switches can also be used in applications  where a switch is not required and the optics are only for  indications. This type of an indicator is commonly called  an annunciator.  

![](images/52f2ce7ac7e0004a13ef6bb05ffb6636b47308958fa76cd5f066eb2c912220a8.jpg)  
Figure 12-75.   Cross-section of a microswitch.  

# Dual In-Line Parallel (DIP) Switches  

The acronym “DIP” switch is defined as Dual In-Line Parallel  switch in reference to the physical layout. DIP switches are  commonly found in card cages, and line replaceable units  (LRU) and are used in most cases to adjust gains, control  configurations, and so forth. Each one of the switches is  generally an SPST slide or rocker switch. The technician may  find this switch in packages ranging in size from DIP2 through  DIP32. Some of the more common sizes are DIP4 and DIP8.  

# Switch Guards  

Switch guards are covers that protect a switch from  unintended operation. Prior to the operation of the switch, the  guard is usually lifted. Switch guards are commonly found  on systems such as fire suppression and override logics for  various systems.  Figure 12-79A  shows a traditional switch  with a guard while  Figure 12-79B  shows a pushbutton switch  with a guard. The guard needs to be moved before the switch  can be pushed.  

# Relays  

A relay is simply an electromechanical switch where a small  amount of current can control a large amount of current.  [Figure 12-80]  When a voltage is applied to the coil of the  

![](images/423b9b219b1df096e25390824a530cbfbda05a764832f1caa551f4f8c6b44537.jpg)

relay, the electromagnet is energized due to the current. When  energized, an electromagnetic field pulls the common (C) or  arm of the relay down. When the arm or common is pulled  down, the circuit between the arm and the normally closed  (NC) contacts is opened and the circuit between the arm and the  normally open (NO) contacts are closed. When the energizing  voltage is removed, the spring returns the arm contacts back to  the normally closed (NC) contacts. The relay usually has two  connections for the coil. The  $(+)$   side is designated as X1 and  the ground-side of the coil is designated as X2.  

# Series DC Circuits  

The series circuit is the most basic electrical circuit and  provides a good introduction to basic circuit analysis. The  series circuit represents the first building block for all of  the circuits to be studied and analyzed.  Figure 12-81  shows  this simple circuit with nothing more than a voltage source  or battery, a conductor, and a resistor. This is classified as a  series circuit because the components are connected end-to- end, so that the same current flows through each component  equally. There is only one path for the current to take and the  battery and resistor are in series with each other. Next is to  make a few additions to the simple circuit in  Figure 12-81 .  

Figure 12-82  shows an additional resistor and a little more  

![](images/35bc930fb646d49c819d21189c6c8712a6ffc2b381353a76381980df3db8f284.jpg)  
Figure 12-78.   Lighted pushbutton switches.  

detail regarding the values. With these values, we can now  begin to learn more about the nature of the circuit. In this  configuration, there is a 12-volt DC source in series with two  resistors,  $\mathrm{R}_{1}=10\,\Omega$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{2}=30\,\Omega$  . For resistors in a series  configuration, the total resistance of the circuit is equal to  the sum of the individual resistors. The basic formula is:  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}\,{=}\,\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}+\mathrm{R}_{3}+\mathrm{z}\mathrm{z}\mathrm{w}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}}
$$  

For  Figure 12-82 , this will be:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=10\;\Omega+30\;\Omega}\\ {\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=40\;\Omega}\end{array}
$$  

Now that the total resistance of the circuit is known, the  current for the circuit can be determined. In a series circuit,  the current cannot be different at different points within the  circuit. The current through a series circuit is always the  same through each element and at any point. Therefore, the  current in the simple circuit can now be determined using  Ohm’s Law:  

Ohm’s Law describes a relationship between the variables  of voltage, current, and resistance that is linear and easy to  illustrate with a few extra calculations. First is the act of  changing the total resistance of the circuit while the other  two remain constant. In this example, the   $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}$   of the circuit  in  Figure 12-82  is doubled.  

The effects on the total current in the circuit are:  

![](images/2d9b83c9fac40d04f75bd1bc22f1708632f2362449c863fa7c440f878a6ec8ed.jpg)  
Figure 12-79.  (A)  Red guarded switch. (B) Pushbutton switch with  a guard.  

It can be seen quantitatively and intuitively that when the  resistance of the circuit is doubled, the current is reduced by  half the original value.  

Next, reduce the  ${\mathbf{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}$   of the circuit in  Figure 12-82  to half of  its original value. The effects on the total current are:

Figure 12-81.   Simple DC circuit.  

Voltage Drops & Further Application of Ohm’s Law The example circuit in  Figure 12-83  is used to illustrate the  idea of voltage drop. It is important to differentiate between  voltage and voltage drop when discussing series circuits.  Voltage drop refers to the loss in electrical pressure or emf  caused by forcing electrons through a resistor. Because there  are two resistors in the example, there are separate voltage  drops. Each drop is associated with each individual resistor.  The amount of electrical pressure required to force a given  number of electrons through a resistance is proportional to  the size of the resistor.  

In  Figure 12-83 , the values used to illustrate the idea of  voltage drop are:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{R}_{1}=1\ \mathrm{k}\Omega}\\ &{\mathrm{R}_{2}=3\ \mathrm{k}\Omega}\\ &{\mathrm{R}_{3}=5\ \mathrm{k}\Omega}\end{array}
$$  

The voltage drop across each resistor is calculated using  Ohm’s Law. The drop for each resistor is the product of each  resistance and the total current in the circuit. Keep in mind  that the same current flows through series resistor.  

$$
\mathrm{E=I\left(R\right)}
$$  

The source voltage can now be determined, which can then  be used to confirm the calculations for each voltage drop.  Using Ohm’s Law:  

$$
\mathrm{E=I\left(R\right)}
$$  

Formula:  

Source voltage  $=$   current  $\times$   the total resistance 	  ${\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{S}}=\mathrm{I}\left({\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$  

![](images/ca9a4522b3c9d2f9a9fbcde6c0fc1027c9a474e124135f1a9829bc1c1d083bdd.jpg)  
Figure 12-82.   Simple DC circuit with additional resistor.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{R_{T}=1\ k\Omega+3\ k\Omega+5\ k\Omega}}\\ &{\mathrm{R_{T}=9\ k\Omega}}\\ &{\mathrm{\Omega}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{S}=I\left(R_{T}\right)}}\\ &{\mathrm{\Omega}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{S}=1\ m A\left(9\ k\Omega\right)}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{S}=9\ v o l t s}}\end{array}
$$  

Simple checks to confirm the calculation and to illustrate  the concept of the voltage drop add up the individual values  of the voltage drops and compare them to the results of the  above calculation.  

$$
1\ \mathrm{volt}+3\ \mathrm{volt}+5\ \mathrm{volt}=9\ \mathrm{volt}
$$  

# Voltage Sources in Series  

A voltage source is an energy source that provides a constant  voltage to a load. Two or more of these sources in series equals  the algebraic sum of all the sources connected in series. The  significance of pointing out the algebraic sum is to indicate that  the polarity of the sources must be considered when adding up  the sources. The polarity is indicated by a plus or minus sign  depending on the source’s position in the circuit.  

In  Figure 12-84,  all of the sources are in the same direction  in terms of their polarity. All of the voltages have the same  sign when added up. In the case of  Figure 12-84 , three cells  of a value of 1.5 volts are in series with the polarity in the  same direction. The addition is simple enough:  

$$
\mathrm{E_{T}}=1.5\mathrm{v}+1.5\mathrm{v}+1.5\mathrm{v}=+4.5\mathrm{\;volts}
$$  

However, in  Figure 12-85 , one of the three sources has been  turned around, and the polarity opposes the other two sources.  Again the addition is simple:  

$$
\mathrm{E_{T}}=+\ 1.5\mathrm{v}-1.5\mathrm{v}+1.5\mathrm{v}=+1.5\mathrm{\volt{s}}
$$  

# Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law  

A law of basic importance to the analysis of an electrical  circuit is Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. This law simply states  that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path  or loop is zero. Another way of saying it: the sum of all the  voltage drops equals the total source voltage. A simplified  formula showing this law is shown below:  

Notice that the sign of the source is opposite that of the  individual voltage drops. Therefore, the algebraic sum equals  zero. Written another way:  

![](images/2d00dfa4404254a1695233627b9ee5881dc99229abd45202af2d48f204a2d5c4.jpg)  
Figure 12-83.   Example of three resistors in series.  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{S}}=\mathrm{E}_{1}+\mathrm{E}_{2}+\mathrm{E}_{3}\ldots+\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{N}}
$$  

The source voltage equals the sum of the voltage drops. The  polarity of the voltage drop is determined by the direction  of the current flow. When going around the circuit, notice  that the polarity of the resistor is opposite that of the source  voltage. The positive on the resistor is facing the positive  on the source, and the negative on the resistor is facing the  negative on the source.  

Figure 12-86  illustrates the very basic idea of Kirchhoff’s  Voltage Law. There are two resistors in this example. One  has a drop of 14 volts and the other has a drop of 10 volts.  The source voltage must equal the sum of the voltage drops  around the circuit. By inspection, it is easy to determine the  source voltage as 24 volts.  

Figure 12-87  shows a series circuit with three voltage  drops and one voltage source rated at 24 volts. Two of the  voltage drops are known. However, the third is not known.  Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, the third voltage drop can  be determined.  

With three resistors in the circuit:  Substitute the known values:  

$24\mathrm{v}-12\mathrm{v}-10\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{E}_{3}=0$  

Solve for the unknown:  $\mathrm{E}_{3}=2$   volts  

Determine the value of  $\mathrm{E}_{4}$   in  Figure 12-88 . For this example,   $\mathrm{I}=200\mathrm{mA}$  .  

First, the voltage drop across each of the individual resistors  must be determined.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{{\mathrm{E}}_{1}={\mathrm{I}}\left({\mathrm{R}}_{1}\right)}\\ &{{\mathrm{E}}_{1}=(200\,\mathrm{mA})\left(10\,\Omega\right)}\end{array}
$$  

![](images/76e3433c733a1c64603040a67f8e2b4378f32c8f3352c7b9a3ba9d73e83cfeb9.jpg)  
Figure 12-84.   Voltage sources in series add algebraically.  

Voltage drop across  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   	  $\mathrm{E}_{1}=2$   volts  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E}_{2}=\mathrm{I}\left(\mathrm{R}_{2}\right)}\\ &{\mathrm{E}_{2}=(200\,\mathrm{mA})\left(50\,\Omega\right)}\end{array}
$$  

Voltage drop across   $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   	  $\mathrm{E}_{2}=10$   volts  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E}_{3}=\mathrm{I}\left(\mathrm{R}_{3}\right)}\\ &{\mathrm{E}_{3}=(200\,\mathrm{mA})\left(100\,\Omega\right)}\end{array}
$$  

Voltage drop across  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   	  $\mathrm{E}_{3}=20$   volts  

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law is now employed to determine the  voltage drop across   $\mathrm{E}_{4}$  .  

$$
100\mathrm{v}-2\mathrm{v}-10\mathrm{v}-20\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{E}_{4}=0
$$  

Using Ohm’s Law and substituting in   $\mathrm{E}_{4}$  , the value for   $\mathrm{R}_{4}$  can now be determined.

# Voltage Dividers  

Voltage dividers are devices that make it possible to obtain  more than one voltage from a single power source. A voltage  divider usually consists of a resistor, or resistors connected in  series, with fixed or movable contacts and two fixed terminal  contacts. As current flows through the resistor, different  voltages can be obtained between the contacts.  

Series circuits are used for voltage dividers. The voltage divider  rule allows the technician to calculate the voltage across one  or a combination of series resistors without having to first  calculate the current in the circuit.  [Figure 12-89]  Because  the current flows through each resistor, the voltage drops are  proportional to the ohmic values of the constituent resistors.  To understand how a voltage divider works, examine  Figure 12-90  carefully and observe the following:  

Each load draws a given amount of current:   $\mathrm{I}_{1},\,\mathrm{I}_{2},\,\mathrm{I}_{3}$  . In  

![](images/eb65af41346d6cff1c7c7cc29b0bc28cca067236aa31403fa2f04d33eb3dc9e8.jpg)

Figure 12-87.   Determine the unknown voltage drop.  

addition to the load currents, some bleeder current   $\mathrm{(I_{B})}$   flows.  The current  $\left(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$   is drawn from the power source and is equal  to the sum of all currents.  

The voltage at each point is measured with respect to a  common point. Note that the common point is the point at  which the total current   $\left(\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$   divides into separate currents   $(\mathrm{I}_{1},$   $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{I}}_{2},\boldsymbol{\mathrm{I}}_{3})$  . Each part of the voltage divider has a different current  flowing in it. The current distribution is as follows:  

Through   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   — bleeder current   $\mathrm{(I_{B})}$  Through   $\mathrm{R}_{2}\,{\longrightarrow}\,\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{B}}+\mathrm{I}_{1}$  Through   ${\mathrm{R}}_{3}\longrightarrow{\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{B}}+{\mathrm{I}}_{1},+{\mathrm{I}}_{2}$  

The voltage across each resistor of the voltage divider is:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{90\;\mathrm{volts}\;\mathrm{accross}\;\mathrm{R}_{1}}\\ {60\;\mathrm{volts}\;\mathrm{accross}\;\mathrm{R}_{2}}\\ {50\;\mathrm{volts}\;\mathrm{accross}\;\mathrm{R}_{3}}\end{array}
$$  

The voltage divider circuit discussed up to this point has had  one side of the power supply (battery) at ground potential. In  Figure 12-91,  the common reference point (ground symbol)  has been moved to a different point on the voltage divider.  The voltage drop across  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   is 20 volts; however, since tap A is  connected to a point in the circuit that is at the same potential  as the negative side of the battery, the voltage between tap  A and the reference point is a negative   $(-)$   20 volts. Since  resistors  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   are connected to the positive side of the  battery, the voltages between the reference point and tap B  or C are positive.  

The following rules provide a simple method of determining  negative and positive voltages: (1) If current enters a  resistance flowing away from the reference point, the voltage  drop across that resistance is positive in respect to the  reference point; (2) if current flows out of a resistance toward  the reference point, the voltage drop across that resistance is  negative in respect to the reference point. It is the location  of the reference point that determines whether a voltage is  negative or positive.  

Tracing the current flow provides a means for determining  the voltage polarity.  Figure 12-92  shows the same circuit  with the polarities of the voltage drops and the direction of  current flow indicated.  

The current flows from the negative side of the battery to  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  .  Tap A is at the same potential as the negative terminal of the  battery since the slight voltage drop caused by the resistance  of the conductor is disregarded; however, 20 volts of the  source voltage are required to force the current through  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  and this 20-volt drop has the polarity indicated. Stated another  way, there are only 80 volts of electrical pressure left in the  

![](images/55f30be4ed8f95d99de350dc76a13bfd0619a3131424a23adb79dff78c62b368.jpg)  
Figure 12-88.   Determine the unknown voltage drop.  

circuit on the ground side of  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  

When the current reaches tap B, 30 more volts have been used  to move the electrons through   $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  , and in a similar manner  the remaining 50 volts are used for   $\mathrm{R}_{3}$  . But the voltages  across  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   are positive voltages, since they are above  ground potential.  

Figure 12-93  shows the voltage divider used previously. The  voltage drops across the resistances are the same; however,  the reference point (ground) has been changed. The voltage  between ground and tap A is now a negative 100 volts, or  the applied voltage.  

The voltage between ground and tap B is a negative 80 volts,  and the voltage between ground and tap C is a negative 50 volts.  

# Determining the Voltage Divider Formula  

Figure 12-94  shows the example network of four resistors and  a voltage source. With a few simple calculations, a formula  for determining the voltage divisions in a series circuit can  be determined.  

The voltage drop across any particular resistor shall be called   $\mathrm{E_{X}}$  , where the subscript  $\mathbf{X}$   is the value of a particular resistor  (1, 2, 3, or 4). Using Ohm’s Law, the voltage drop across any

resistor can be determined.  

As seen earlier in the handbook, the current is equal to the  source voltage divided by the total resistance of the series  circuit.  

$$
\mathrm{Current}{\mathrm{:I}}={\frac{\mathrm{E_{S}}}{\mathrm{R_{T}}}}
$$  

The current equation can now be substituted into the equation for Ohm’s Law.  

This equation is the general voltage divider formula. The

Figure 12-91.   Positive and negative voltage on a voltage divider.  

explanation of this formula is that the voltage drop across  any resistor or combination of resistors in a series circuit is  equal to the ratio of the resistance value to the total resistance,  divided by the value of the source voltage.  Figure 12-95 illustrates this with a network of three resistors and one  voltage source.  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E_{X}=\left({\frac{\partial R_{X}}{\partial R_{T}}}\right)E_{S}}}\\ &{\mathrm{R_{T}=100\,\Omega\,+300\,\Omega\,+600\,\Omega\,=1,000\,\Omega}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{S}=10\,V}}\end{array}}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{X}}\,{=}\,\displaystyle\left(\frac{100\,\Omega}{1,000\,\Omega}\right)\,100\,\mathrm{V}}\\ {\mathrm{E}_{100\Omega}\,\,{=}\,10\,\mathrm{V}}\end{array}

Voltage drop over   $600\,\Omega$    resistor is:  

$$

# Parallel DC Circuits  

A circuit in which two of more electrical resistances or loads  are connected across the same voltage source is called a  parallel circuit. The primary difference between the series  circuit and the parallel circuit is that more than one path is  provided for the current in the parallel circuit. Each of these  parallel paths is called a branch. The minimum requirements  for a parallel circuit are the following:  

•	 A power source •	 Conductors •	 A resistance or load for each current path •	 Two or more paths for current flow  

Figure 12-96  depicts the most basic parallel circuit. Current  flowing out of the source divides at point A in the diagram  and goes through  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  . As more branches are added to  the circuit, more paths for the source current are provided.  

# Voltage Drops  

The first point to understand is that the voltage across any  branch is equal to the voltage across all of the other branches.  

# Total Parallel Resistance  

The parallel circuit consists of two or more resistors connected  in such a way as to allow current flow to pass through all of the  resistors at once. This eliminates the need for current to pass  one resistor before passing through the next. When resistors  are connected in parallel, the total resistance of the circuit  

![](images/cb0706b59f68a55faed597e060de7a6f66e06f6f27decf37af96c34c9b44e358.jpg)  
Figure 12-94.   Four resistor voltage divider.  

decreases. The total resistance of a parallel combination is  always less than the value of the smallest resistor in the circuit.  In the series circuit, the current has to pass through the resistors  one at a time. This gave a resistance to the current equal the sum  of all the resistors. In the parallel circuit, the current has several  resistors that it can pass through, actually reducing the total  resistance of the circuit in relation to any one resistor value.  

The amount of current passing through each resistor varies  according to its individual resistance. The total current of  the circuit is the sum of the current in all branches. It can  be determined by inspection that the total current is greater  than that of any given branch. Using Ohm’s Law to calculate  the total resistance based on the applied voltage and the total  current, it can be determined that the total resistance is less  than any branch.  

An example of this is if there was a circuit with a   $100~\Omega$  resistor and a   $5~\Omega$   resistor; while the exact value must be  calculated, it still can be said that the combined resistance  between the two is less than the   $5\;\Omega$  .  

# Resistors in Parallel  

The formula for the total parallel resistance is as follows:  

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{3}}+\ldots\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}}}
$$  

If the reciprocal of both sides is taken, then the general  formula for the total parallel resistance is:  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{=\frac{1}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{3}}+\ldots\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}}}}}
$$  

# Two Resistors in Parallel  

Typically, it is more convenient to consider only two resistors  at a time because this setup occurs in common practice. Any  number of resistors in a circuit can be broken down into pairs.  Therefore, the most common method is to use the formula  

![](images/7f1d35c43466ad5569388006e21195d363d57dd8e536785404b72b3583e12a2b.jpg)

for two resistors in parallel.  

$$
{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{=\frac{\mathrm{1}}{{\frac{\mathrm{1}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{1}}}+{\frac{\mathrm{1}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{2}}}}}
$$  

Combining the terms in the denominator and rewriting:  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}\!={\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}\!+\!\mathrm{R}_{2}}}
$$  

Put in words, this states that the total resistance for two  resistors in parallel is equal to the product of both resistors  divided by the sum of the two resistors. In the formula below,  calculate the total resistance.  

$$
{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}\!={\frac{{\mathrm{R}}_{1}{\mathrm{R}}_{2}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{1}+{\mathrm{R}}_{2}}}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{R_{1}}=500\;\Omega}\\ {\mathrm{R_{2}}=400\;\Omega}\\ {\mathrm{R_{T}}=\displaystyle\frac{500\;\Omega\,400\;\Omega}{500\;\Omega+400\;\Omega}}\\ {\mathrm{R_{T}}=\displaystyle\frac{200.000\;\Omega}{900\;\Omega}}\\ {\mathrm{R_{T}}=222.22\;\Omega}\end{array}
$$  

# Current Source  

A current source is an energy source that provides a constant  value of current to a load even when the load changes in  resistive value. The general rule to remember is that the total  current produced by current sources in parallel is equal to the  algebraic sum of the individual sources.  

# Kirchhoff’s Current Law  

Kirchhoff’s Current Law can be stated as: the sum of the  currents into a junction or node is equal to the sum of the  currents flowing out of that same junction or node. A junction  can be defined as a point in the circuit where two or more  circuit paths come together. In the case of the parallel circuit,  it is the point in the circuit where the individual branches join.  

![](images/d7b66ec529cc8b2d66a46a3941055ce28c1ad21474091c00917baf18573ed133.jpg)  
Figure 12-96.   Basic parallel circuit.  

General formula  $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{I}_{1}+\mathrm{I}_{2}+\mathrm{I}_{3}$  

Refer to  Figure 12-97  for an example. Point A and point B  represent two junctions or nodes in the circuit with three  resistive branches in between. The voltage source provides  a total current  $\mathrm{I_{T}}$   into node A. At this point, the current must  divide, flowing out of node A into each of the branches  according to the resistive value of each branch. Kirchhoff’s  Current Law states that the current going in must equal that  going out. Following the current through the three branches  and back into node B, the total current  $\mathrm{I_{T}}$   entering node B  and leaving node B is the same as that which entered node  A. The current then continues back to the voltage source.  

Figure 12-98  shows that the individual branch currents are:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{I}_{1}=5\;\mathrm{mA}}\\ {\mathrm{I}_{2}=12\;\mathrm{mA}}\end{array}
$$  

The total current flow into the node A equals the sum of the  branch currents, which is:	  $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{I}_{1}+\mathrm{I}_{2}$  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{;\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}=5\:\mathrm{mA}+12\:\mathrm{mA}}\\ {\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}=17\:\mathrm{mA}}\end{array}
$$  

The total current entering node B is also the same.  

Figure 12-99  illustrates how to determine an unknown current  in one branch. Note that the total current into a junction of  the three branches is known. Two of the branch currents are  known. By rearranging the general formula, the current in  branch two can be determined.  

General formula 	 I  $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{I}_{1}+\mathrm{I}_{2}+\mathrm{I}_{3}$  Substitute 	  $75\;\mathrm{mA}=30\;\mathrm{mA}+\mathrm{I}_{2}+20\;\mathrm{mA}$  Solve  $\mathrm{I}_{2}$   	  $\mathrm{I}_{2}=75\;\mathrm{mA}-30\;\mathrm{mA}-20\;\mathrm{mA}$  	 I 2  = 25 mA  

# Current Dividers  

It can now be easily seen that the parallel circuit is a current  divider. As shown in  Figure 12-96 , there is a current through  each of the two resistors. Because the same voltage is applied  across both resistors in parallel, the branch currents are  inversely proportional to the ohmic values of the resistors.  Branches with higher resistance have less current than those  with lower resistance. For example, if the resistive value of   $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   is twice as high as that of   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  , the current in  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   is half of  that of  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  . All of this can be determined with Ohm’s Law.  

By Ohm’s Law, the current through any one of the branches  can be written as:  

The voltage source appears across each of the parallel resistors  and  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{X}}$   represents any one the resistors. The source voltage  is equal to the total current times the total parallel resistance.  

Substituting  $\mathrm{I_{T}R_{T}}$   for  $\mathrm{{E}_{S}}$  

Rearranging  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{I}_{2}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}}\\ {\mathrm{I}_{1}=\left(\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}}\end{array}
$$  

This formula is the general current divider formula. The  current through any branch equals the total parallel resistance  divided by the individual branch resistance, multiplied by  the total current.  

# Series-Parallel DC Circuits  

Most of the circuits that the technician encounters will not  be a simple series or parallel circuit. Circuits are usually a  combination of both, known as series-parallel circuits, which  are groups consisting of resistors in parallel and in series. An  example of this type of circuit can be seen in  Figure 12-100 .  While the series-parallel circuit can initially appear to be  complex, the same rules that have been used for the series  and parallel circuits can be applied to these circuits.  

The voltage source provides a current out to resistor   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  ,  then to the group of resistors  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   and then to the next  resistor  $\mathrm{R}_{4}$   before returning to the voltage source. The first  step in the simplification process is to isolate the group  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  and   $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   and recognize that they are a parallel network that  can be reduced to an equivalent resistor. Using the formula  for parallel resistance,  

$$
\mathbf{R}_{23}=\frac{\mathbf{R}_{2}\mathbf{R}_{3}}{\mathbf{R}_{2}+\mathbf{R}_{3}}
$$  

$\mathrm{R}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   can be reduced to  $\mathrm{R}_{23}$  .  Figure 12-101  now shows  an equivalent circuit with three series connected resistors. The  total resistance of the circuit can now be simply determined  by adding up the values of resistors  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  ,  $\mathrm{R}_{23}$  , and  $\mathrm{R}_{4}$  .  

# Determining the Total Resistance  

A more quantitative example for determining total resistance  and the current in each branch in a combination circuit is  shown in the following example.  [Figure 12-102]  

The first step is to determine the current at junction A,  leading into the parallel branch. To determine the  $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}$  , the total

resistance   ${\mathbf{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}$   of the entire circuit must be known. The total  resistance of the circuit is given as:  

$$
{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{R}}}_{\mathrm{T}}={\boldsymbol{\mathrm{R}}}_{1}+{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{R}}}_{23}
$$  

$$
\mathbf{R}_{23}\!=\!\frac{2\mathbf{k}\:\Omega\:3\mathbf{k}\:\Omega}{2\mathbf{k}\:\Omega+3\mathbf{k}\:\Omega}
$$  

Find  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{EQ}}$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=1\mathbf{k}\:\Omega+1.2\mathbf{k}\:\Omega}}\\ {{\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=2.2\mathbf{k}\:\Omega}}\end{array}
$$  

With the total resistance  ${\mathbf{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}$   now determined, the total  $\mathrm{I_{T}}$   can  be determined. Using Ohm’s Law:  

$$
\mathrm{Subtract~values}\ \ \ \ \mathrm{I_{T}=\frac{E_{S}}{R_{T}}}
$$  

The current through the parallel branches of   $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   and   $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   can  be determined using the current divider rule discussed earlier  in this handbook.  

Recall Parallel Branch Resistance:  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{23}\!=\frac{6{,}000\;\Omega}{5{,}000\;\Omega}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{23}\,{=}\,\,1.2\mathrm{k}\,\Omega
$$  

Substitute values for  $\mathrm{I}_{2}$  :

$$  

Now using Kirchhoff’s Current Law, the current in the branch  with  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   can be determined.  

$$
{\mathrm{I}}_{2}+{\mathrm{I}}_{3}={\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{T}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{T}}-\mathrm{I}_{2}=\mathrm{I}_{3}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{I}_{3}=4.36\;\mathrm{mA}

# Alternating Current (AC) & Voltage  

Alternating current (AC) has largely replaced direct current  (DC) in commercial power systems for a number of reasons.  It can be transmitted over long distances more readily and  more economically than DC, since AC voltages can be  

![](images/4ba06c158ecba36abed21c4d4a87354915a8d165c1c3974fce68cca9d652b1ec.jpg)  
Figure 12-102.   Determining total resistance.  

Because more and more units are being operated electrically  in airplanes, the power requirements are such that a number  of advantages can be realized by using AC. Space and  weight can be saved since AC devices, especially motors, are  smaller and simpler than DC devices. In most AC motors,  no brushes are required, and commutation trouble at high  altitude is eliminated. Circuit breakers operate satisfactorily  under load at high altitudes in an AC system, whereas arcing  is so excessive on DC systems that circuit breakers must be  replaced frequently. Finally, most airplanes using a 24-volt  DC system have special equipment that requires a certain  amount of 400-cycle AC current.  

# AC and DC Compared  

Many of the principles, characteristics, and effects of AC  are similar to those of DC. Similarly, there are a number of  differences. DC flows constantly in only one direction with  a constant polarity. It changes magnitude only when the  circuit is opened or closed, as shown in the DC waveform  in  Figure 12-103 . AC changes direction at regular intervals,  increases in value at a definite rate from zero to a maximum  positive strength, and decreases back to zero; then it flows  in the opposite direction, similarly increasing to a maximum  negative value, and again decreasing to zero. DC and AC  waveforms are compared in  Figure 12-103 .  

Since AC constantly changes direction and intensity, the  following two effects (to be discussed later) take place in  AC circuits that do not occur in DC circuits:  

1.	 Inductive reactance 2.	 Capacitive reactance  

# Generator Principles  

After the discovery that an electric current flowing through  a conductor creates a magnetic field around the conductor,  there was considerable scientific speculation about whether  a magnetic field could create a current flow in a conductor.  In 1831, Faraday discovered that this could be accomplished.  

To show how an electric current can be created by a magnetic  field, a demonstration similar to  Figure 12-104  can be used.  Several turns of a conductor are wrapped around a cylindrical  form, and the ends of the conductor are connected together  to form a complete circuit, which includes a galvanometer.  If a simple bar magnet is plunged into the cylinder, the  galvanometer can be observed to deflect in one direction  from its zero (center) position.  [Figure 12-104A]  

When the magnet is at rest inside the cylinder, the  galvanometer shows a reading of zero, indicating that no  In  Figure 12-104C , the galvanometer indicates a current  flow in the opposite direction when the magnet is pulled  from the cylinder.  

The same results may be obtained by holding the magnet  stationary and moving the cylinder over the magnet, indicating  that a current flows when there is relative motion between the  wire coil and the magnetic field. These results obey a law first  stated by the German scientist, Heinrich Lenz. Lenz’s Law  states that the induced current caused by the relative motion  of a conductor and a magnetic field always flows in such a  direction that its magnetic field opposes the motion.  

When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, an emf  is induced in the conductor.  [Figure 12-105]  The direction  (polarity) of the induced emf is determined by the magnetic  lines of force and the direction the conductor is moved  through the magnetic field. The generator left-hand rule  (not to be confused with the left-hand rules used with a coil)  can be used to determine the direction of the induced emf.  [Figure 12-106]  The left-hand rule is summed up as follows:  

The first finger of the left hand is pointed in the direction  of the magnetic lines of force (North to South), the thumb  is pointed in the direction of movement of the conductor  through the magnetic field, and the second finger points in  the direction of the induced emf.  

When a loop conductor is rotated in a magnetic field, a  voltage is induced in each side of the loop.  [Figure 12-107] The two sides cut the magnetic field in opposite directions,  and although the current flow is continuous, it moves in  opposite directions with respect to the two sides of the loop.  If sides A and B and the loop are rotated half a turn and  the sides of the conductor have exchanged positions, the  induced emf in each wire reverses its direction, since the wire  formerly cutting the lines of force in an upward direction is  now moving downward.  

The value of an induced emf depends on three factors:  

1.	 Number of wires moving through the magnetic field 2.	 Strength of the magnetic field 3.	 Speed of rotation  

# Generators of Alternating Current  

Generators used to produce an alternating current are called  AC generators or alternators.  

The simple generator constitutes one method of generating  an alternating voltage.  [Figure 12-108]  It consists of  

![](images/49537e2a0b5fda238bab0936cd4e54f387ba0c1ead3538e83be5709e36786335.jpg)

Figure 12-104.   Inducing a current flow.  

a rotating loop, marked A and B, placed between two  magnetic poles, N and S. The ends of the loop are connected  to two metal slip rings (collector rings),  $\mathrm{C}_{1}$   and  $\mathrm{C}_{2}$  . Current  is taken from the collector rings by brushes. If the loop is  considered as separate wires A and B, and the left-hand  rule for generators is applied, then it can be observed that  as wire A moves up across the field, a voltage is induced  which causes the current to flow inward. As wire B moves  down across the field, a voltage is induced which causes the  current to flow outward. When the wires are formed into a  loop, the voltages induced in the two sides of the loop are  combined. Therefore, for explanatory purposes, the action  of either conductor, A or B, while rotating in the magnetic  field is similar to the action of the loop.  

Figure 12-109  illustrates the generation of AC with a simple  loop conductor rotating in a magnetic field. As it is rotated  in a counterclockwise direction, varying values of voltages  are induced in it.  

# Position 1  

The conductor A moves parallel to the lines of force. Since  it cuts no lines of force, the induced voltage is zero. As the  conductor advances from position 1 to position 2, the voltage  induced gradually increases.  

# Position 2  

The conductor is now moving perpendicular to the flux  and cuts a maximum number of lines of force; therefore, a  maximum voltage is induced. As the conductor moves beyond  position 2, it cuts a decreasing amount of flux at each instant,  and the induced voltage decreases.  

# Position 3  

At this point, the conductor has made one-half of a revolution  and again moves parallel to the lines of force, and no voltage  is induced in the conductor. As the A conductor passes  position 3, the direction of induced voltage now reverses  since the A conductor is moving downward, cutting flux

in the opposite direction. As the A conductor moves across  the South pole, the induced voltage gradually increases in a  negative direction, until it reaches position 4.  

# Position 4  

Like position 2, the conductor is again moving perpendicular  to the flux and generates a maximum negative voltage. From  position 4 to 5, the induced voltage gradually decreases until  the voltage is zero, and the conductor and wave are ready to  start another cycle.  

# Position 5  

The curve shown at position 5 is called a sine wave. It  represents the polarity and the magnitude of the instantaneous  values of the voltages generated. The horizontal base line is  divided into degrees, or time, and the vertical distance above  or below the base line represents the value of voltage at each  particular point in the rotation of the loop.

Figure 12-107.   Voltage induced in a loop.  

# Cycle and Frequency Cycle Defined  

A cycle is a repetition of a pattern. Whenever a voltage  or current passes through a series of changes, returns to  the starting point, and then again starts the same series of  changes, the series is called a cycle. The cycle is represented  by the symbol of a wavy line in a circle  $\circledcirc$  . In the cycle of  voltage shown in  Figure 12-110 , the voltage increases from  zero to a maximum positive value, decreases to zero; then  increases to a maximum negative value, and again decreases  to zero. At this point, it is ready to go through the same series  of changes. There are two alternations in a complete cycle:  the positive alternation and the negative. Each is half a cycle.  

# Frequency Defined  

The frequency is the number of cycles of AC per second (1

second). The standard unit of frequency measurement is the  hertz   $\mathrm{(Hz)}$  .  [Figure 12-111]  In a generator, the voltage and  current pass through a complete cycle of values each time  a coil or conductor passes under a North and South pole of  the magnet. The number of cycles for each revolution of the  coil or conductor is equal to the number of pairs of poles.  The frequency, then, is equal to the number of cycles in  one revolution multiplied by the number of revolutions per  second (rps).

$$
\mathrm{F}={\frac{\mathrm{Number\;of\;poles}}{2}}\times{\frac{\mathrm{rpm}}{60}}
$$  

where   $\%$   is the number of pairs of poles, and   $\mathrm{{rpm}}/60$   the  number of revolutions per second. If in a 2-pole generator,  the conductor is turning at   $3{,}600~\mathrm{rpm}$  , the revolutions per  second are:  

$$
\mathrm{rps}\,{=}\,\frac{3{,}600}{60}\,{=}\,60\;\mathrm{revolutionons}\;\mathrm{per}\;\mathrm{second}
$$  

Since there are 2 poles,  $\%$   is 1, and the frequency is 60 cycles  per second (cps). In a 4-pole generator with an armature speed  of   $1{,}800\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , substitute in the equation:  

$$
\mathrm{F}\,{=}\,\frac{4}{2}\times\,\frac{1{,}800}{60}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{F}=2\times30
$$  

$\mathrm{F}=60$   cps  

# Period Defined  

The time required for a sine wave to complete one full cycle  is called a period.  [Figure 12-110]  The period of a sine  wave is inversely proportional to the frequency: the higher  the frequency, the shorter the period. The mathematical  relationship between frequency and period is given as:  

$$
\begin{array}{c l}{\mathrm{period\is\t{=}\displaystyle\frac{1}{f}}}\\ {\mathrm{Fracompany\is\f{=}\displaystyle\frac{1}{t}}}\end{array}
$$  

# Wavelength Defined  

The distance that a waveform travels during a period is  commonly referred to as a wavelength and is indicated by  the Greek letter lambda  $(\backslash)$  . The measurement of wavelength  is taken from one point on the waveform to a corresponding  point on the next waveform.  [Figure 12-110]  

# Phase Relationships  

In addition to frequency and cycle characteristics, alternating  voltage and current also have a relationship called “phase.”  In a circuit that is fed (supplied) by one alternator, there  must be a certain phase relationship between voltage and  current if the circuit is to function efficiently. In a system  fed by two or more alternators, not only must there be a  certain phase relationship between voltage and current of  one alternator, but there must be a phase relationship between  the individual voltages and the individual currents. Also, two  separate circuits can be compared by comparing the phase

characteristics of one to the phase characteristics of the other.  

# In Phase Condition  

Figure 12-112A  shows a voltage signal and a current signal  superimposed on the same time axis. Notice that when the  voltage increases in the positive alternation that the current  also increases. When the voltage reaches its peak value, so  does the current. Both waveforms then reverse and decrease  back to a zero magnitude, then proceed in the same manner  in the negative direction as they did in the positive direction.  When two waves, such as these in  Figure 12-112A , are exactly  in step with each other, they are said to be in phase. To be in  phase, the two waveforms must go through their maximum and  minimum points at the same time and in the same direction.  

# Out of Phase Condition  

When two waveforms go through their maximum and  minimum points at different times, a phase difference exists  between the two. In this case, the two wave-forms are said  to be out of phase with each other. The terms lead and lag  are often used to describe the phase difference between  waveforms. The waveform that reaches its maximum or  minimum value first is said to lead the other waveform.  Figure   $_{I2-I I2B}$   shows this relationship. Voltage source  one starts to rise at the   $0^{\circ}$   position and voltage source two  starts to rise at the  $90°$   position. Because voltage source one  begins its rise earlier in time   $(90^{\circ})$   in relation to the second  voltage source, it is said to be leading the second source.  On the other hand, the second source is said to be lagging  the first source. When a waveform is said to be leading or  lagging, the difference in degrees is usually stated. If the  two waveforms differ by  $360^{\circ}$  , they are said to be in phase  with each other. If there is a   $180^{\circ}$   difference between the two  signals, then they are still out of phase even though they are  both reaching their minimum and maximum values at the  same time.  [Figure 12-112C]  

A practical note of caution: When encountering an aircraft that  has two or more AC busses in use, it is possible that they may  be split and not synchronized to be in phase with each other.  When two signals that are not locked in phase are mixed, much  damage can occur to aircraft systems or avionics.  

# Values of Alternating Current  

There are three values of AC: instantaneous, peak, and  effective root mean square (RMS).  

# Instantaneous Value  

An instantaneous value of voltage or current is the induced  voltage or current flowing at any instant during a cycle. The  sine wave represents a series of these values. The instantaneous  

![](images/da0e2d8c4219bc066c614d3d9d83ce72460276e1e733050fea6e4a553af93368.jpg)  
Figure 12-110.   Cycle of voltage.  

value of the voltage varies from zero at  $0^{\circ}$   to maximum at  $90°$  ,  back to zero at   $180^{\circ}$  , to maximum in the opposite direction at   $270^{\circ}$  , and to zero again at  $360^{\circ}$  . Any point on the sine wave is  considered the instantaneous value of voltage.  

# Peak Value  

The peak value is the largest instantaneous value. The largest  single positive value occurs when the sine wave of voltage is  at   $90°$  , and the largest single negative value occurs when it  is at  $270^{\circ}$  . Maximum value is 1.41 times the effective value.  These are called peak values.  

# Effective Value  

The effective value is also known as the RMS value or root  mean square, which refers to the mathematical process by  which the value is derived. Most AC voltmeters display the  effective or RMS value when used. The effective value is  less than the maximum value, being equal to .707 times the  maximum value.  

The effective value of a sine wave is actually a measure of  the heating effect of the sine wave.  Figure 12-113  illustrates  what happens when a resistor is connected across an AC  voltage source. In  Figure 12-113A , a certain amount of heat is  generated by the power in the resistor.  Figure 12-113B  shows  the same resistor now inserted into a DC voltage source.  The value of the DC voltage source can now be adjusted so  that the resistor dissipates the same amount of heat as it did  when it was in the AC circuit. The RMS or effective value  of a sine wave is equal to the DC voltage that produces the  same amount of heat as the sinusoidal voltage.  

The peak value of a sine wave can be converted to the  corresponding RMS value using the following relationship.  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathrm{Vrms}}=({\sqrt{0.5}}\,)\times{\mathrm{Vp}}}\\ {{\mathrm{Vrms}}=0.707\times{\mathrm{Vp}}}\end{array}
$$  

![](images/4cf07e80073063c366786e411df93359f3d22c8a39b44e104131e0eccaf6953d.jpg)  
Figure 12-111.   Frequency in cycles per second.  

This can be applied to either voltage or current.  

Algebraically rearranging the formula and solving for  $\mathrm{V}{\mathfrak{p}}$   can  also determine the peak voltage. The resulting formula is:  

$$
\mathrm{Vp}=1.414\times\mathrm{Vrms}
$$  

Thus, the 110 volt value given for AC supplied to homes  is only 0.707 of the maximum voltage of this supply. The  maximum voltage is approximately 155 volts   $(110\times1.41=$  155 volts maximum).  

In the study of AC, any values given for current or voltage  are assumed to be effective values unless otherwise specified.  In practice, only the effective values of voltage and current  are used. Similarly, AC voltmeters and ammeters measure  the effective value.  

# Opposition to Current Flow of AC  

There are three factors that can create an opposition to the flow  of electrons (current) in an AC circuit. Resistance, similar  to resistance of DC circuits, is measured in ohms and has a  direct influence on AC regardless of frequency. Inductive  reactance and capacitive reactance, on the other hand, oppose  current flow only in AC circuits, not in DC circuits. Since  AC constantly changes direction and intensity, inductors and  capacitors may also create an opposition to current flow in  AC circuits. It should also be noted that inductive reactance  and capacitive reactance may create a phase shift between  the voltage and current in an AC circuit. Whenever analyzing  an AC circuit, it is very important to consider the resistance,  inductive reactance, and the capacitive reactance. All three  have an effect on the current of that circuit.  

![](images/2ad0b88b997dd7697af7a3ab15a14d42595e38e17ef4d505bba3d3db0e9295fc.jpg)  
Figure 12-112.   In phase and out of phase conditions.  

# Capacitance  

Another important property in AC circuits, besides resistance  and inductance, is capacitance. While inductance is  represented in a circuit by a coil, capacitance is represented by  a capacitor. In its most basic form, the capacitor is constructed  of two parallel plates separated by a nonconductor called  a dielectric. In an electrical circuit, a capacitor serves as a  reservoir or storehouse for electricity.  

# Capacitors in Direct Current  

When a capacitor is connected across a source of DC, such as a  storage battery in the circuit shown in  Figure 12-114A , and the  switch is then closed, the plate marked B becomes positively  charged, and the A plate negatively charged. Current flows in  the external circuit during the time the electrons are moving  from B to A. The current flow in the circuit is at a maximum  the instant the switch is closed, but continually decreases  thereafter until it reaches zero. The current becomes zero as  soon as the difference in voltage of A and B becomes the same  as the voltage of the battery. If the switch is opened as shown in  Figure 12-114B , the plates remain charged. Once the capacitor  is shorted, it discharges quickly as shown  Figure 12-114C .  

It should be clear that during the time the capacitor is being  charged or discharged, there is current in the circuit, even  though the circuit is broken by the gap between the capacitor  plates. Current is present only during the time of charge and  discharge, and this period of time is usually short.  

# The Resistor/Capacitor (RC) Time Constant  

The time required for a capacitor to attain a full charge is  proportional to the capacitance and the resistance of the  circuit. The resistance of the circuit introduces the element  of time into the charging and discharging of a capacitor.  

When a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistance,  a certain amount of time is required for a full charge or  discharge. The voltage across the capacitor does not change  instantaneously. The rate of charging or discharging is  determined by the time constant of the circuit. The time  constant of a series resistor/capacitor (RC) circuit is a time  interval that equals the product of the resistance in ohms  and the capacitance in farad and is symbolized by the Greek  letter tau  $(\tau)$  .  

$$
\tau=\mathrm{RC}
$$  

The time in the formula is the time required to charge to 63  percent of the voltage of the source. The time required to  bring the charge to about 99 percent of the source voltage is  approximately   $5~\tau$  .  [Figure 12-115]  

The measure of a capacitor’s ability to store charge is its  capacitance. The symbol used for capacitance is the letter C.  

As can be seen from  Figure 12-115,  there can be no continuous  movement of DC through a capacitor. A good capacitor blocks  DC and passes the effects of pulsing DC or AC.  

# Units of Capacitance  

Electrical charge, which is symbolized by the letter Q, is  measured in units of coulombs. The coulomb is given by  the letter C, as with capacitance. Unfortunately, this can be  confusing. One coulomb of charge is defined as a charge  having   $6.28\times10^{18}$   electrons. The basic unit of capacitance  is the farad and is given by the letter f. By definition, one  

![](images/6e522b109f3e860f4dbfed26f5977ed243870fef4f049251d6d95d6203026af0.jpg)  
Figure 12-113.   Sine wave effective value.  

farad is one coulomb of charge stored with one volt across the  plates of the capacitor. The general formula for capacitance  in terms of charge and voltage is:  

$$
\mathrm{where~\partial~\Omega~}\mathrm{C}=\frac{\mathrm{~Q~}}{\mathrm{~E~}}
$$  

$\mathbf{C}=$   capacitance measured in farads  $\mathrm{E}=$  applied voltage measured in volts  $\mathrm{Q}=$   charge measured in coulombs  

In practical terms, one farad is a large amount of capacitance.  Typically, in electronics, much smaller units are used. The two  more common smaller units are the microfarad  $(\upmu\mathrm{{F})}$  , which is   $10^{-6}$   farad, and the picofarad   $\mathrm{(pF)}$  , which is   $10^{-12}$    farad.  

# Voltage Rating of a Capacitor  

Capacitors have their limits as to how much voltage can be  applied across the plates. The aircraft technician must be  aware of the voltage rating, which specifies the maximum  DC voltage that can be applied without the risk of damage  to the device. This voltage rating is typically called the  breakdown voltage, the working voltage, or simply the  voltage rating. If the voltage applied across the plates is  too great, the dielectric breaks down and arcing occurs  between the plates. The capacitor is then short circuited,  and the possible flow of DC through it can cause damage  to other parts of the equipment.  

A capacitor that can be safely charged to 500 volts DC cannot  be safely subjected to AC or pulsating DC whose effective  values are 500 volts. An alternating voltage of 500 volts (RMS)  has a peak voltage of 707 volts, and a capacitor to which it is  applied should have a working voltage of at least 750 volts. The  capacitor should be selected so that its working voltage is at  least 50 percent greater than the highest voltage to be applied.  

The voltage rating of the capacitor is a factor in determining  the actual capacitance, because capacitance decreases as the  thickness of the dielectric increases. A high-voltage capacitor  that has a thick dielectric must have a larger plate area in  order to have the same capacitance as a similar low voltage  capacitor having a thin dielectric.  

# Factors Affecting Capacitance  

1.	 The capacitance of parallel plates is directly  proportional to their area. A larger plate area produces  a larger capacitance and a smaller area produces less  capacitance. If we double the area of the plates, there  is room for twice as much charge. The charge that a  capacitor can hold at a given potential difference is  doubled, and since  $\mathbf{C}\!=\!\mathbf{Q}/\mathrm{E}$  , the capacitance is doubled. 2.	 The capacitance of parallel plates is inversely  proportional to their spacing. 3.	 The dielectric material affects the capacitance of  parallel plates. The dielectric constant of a vacuum is  defined as 1, and that of air is very close to 1. These  values are used as a reference, and all other materials  have values specified in relation to air (vacuum).  

The strength of some commonly used dielectric materials is  listed in  Figure 12-116 . The voltage rating also depends on  frequency because the losses, and the resultant heating effect,  increase as the frequency increases.  

# Types of Capacitors  

Capacitors come in all shapes and sizes and are usually  marked with their value in farads. They may also be divided  into two groups: fixed and variable. The fixed capacitors,  which have approximately constant capacitance, may then  be further divided according to the type of dielectric used.  Some varieties are: paper, oil, mica, electrolytic and ceramic  capacitors.  Figure 12-117  shows the schematic symbols for  a fixed and variable capacitor.  

# Fixed Capacitors  

Mica Capacitors  

The fixed mica capacitor is made of metal foil plates that are  separated by sheets of mica, which form the dielectric. The  whole assembly is covered in molded plastic, which keeps out  moisture. Mica is an excellent dielectric and withstands higher  voltages than paper without allowing arcing between the plates.  Common values of mica capacitors range from approximately  50 microfarads to about 0.02 microfarads.  [Figure 12-118]  

# Ceramic  

The ceramic capacitor is constructed with materials, such  as titanium acid barium for a dielectric. Internally these  

![](images/bfd56548edfe2d20e55bb3113a62b96478a0e4527035fe3a3ea706d22674a48f.jpg)  
Figure 12-114.   Capacitors in direct current.  

capacitors are not constructed as a coil, so they are well  suited for use in high-frequency applications. They are shaped  like a disk, available in very small capacitance values, and  very small sizes. This type is fairly small, inexpensive, and  reliable. Both the ceramic and the electrolytic are the most  widely available and used capacitor.

Figure 12-115.   Capacitance discharge curve.  

# Electrolytic  

Two kinds of electrolytic capacitors are in use: wet electrolytic  and dry electrolytic. The wet electrolytic capacitor is designed  of two metal plates separated by an electrolyte with an  electrolyte dielectric, which is basically conductive salt in  solvent. For capacitances greater than a few microfarads, the  plate areas of paper or mica capacitors must become very  large; thus, electrolytic capacitors are usually used instead.  These units provide large capacitance in small physical sizes.  Their values range from 1 to about 1,500 microfarads. Unlike  the other types, electrolytic capacitors are generally polarized,  with the positive lead marked with a   $\mathfrak{c}_{+},\mathfrak{s}$   and the negative  lead marked with a “−” and should only be subjected to direct  voltage or pulsating direct voltage only.  

The electrolyte in contact with the negative terminal, either  in paste or liquid form, comprises the negative electrode. The  dielectric is an exceedingly thin film of oxide deposited on  the positive electrode of the capacitor. The positive electrode,  which is an aluminum sheet, is folded to achieve maximum  area. The capacitor is subjected to a forming process during  manufacture in which current is passed through it. The flow  of current results in the deposit of the thin coating of oxide  on the aluminum plate.  

The close spacing of the negative and positive electrodes  gives rise to the comparatively high-capacitance value, but  allows greater possibility of voltage breakdown and leakage  of electrons from one electrode to the other.  

The electrolyte of the dry electrolytic unit is a paste contained  in a separator made of an absorbent material, such as gauze or  paper. The separator not only holds the electrolyte in place but  also prevents it from short circuiting the plates. Dry electrolytic  capacitors are made in both cylindrical and rectangular block  form and may be contained either within cardboard or metal  covers. Since the electrolyte cannot spill, the dry capacitor  may be mounted in any convenient position.  [Figure 12-119]  

# Tantalum  

Similar to the electrolytic, these capacitors are constructed  with a material called tantalum, which is used for the  electrodes. They are superior to electrolytic capacitors,  having better temperature and frequency characteristics.  When tantalum powder is baked in order to solidify it, a crack  forms inside. This crack is used to store an electrical charge.  Like electrolytic capacitors, the tantalum capacitors are also  polarized and are indicated with the  $\leftrightsquigarrow$   and “−” symbols.  

# Polyester Film  

In this capacitor, a thin polyester film is used as a dielectric.  These components are inexpensive, temperature stable, and  widely used. Tolerance is approximately 5–10 percent. It  

# Oil Capacitors  

In radio and radar transmitters, voltages high enough to cause  arcing, or breakdown, of paper dielectrics are often used.  Consequently, in these applications capacitors that use oil or  oil impregnated paper for the dielectric material are preferred.  Capacitors of this type are considerably more expensive than  ordinary paper capacitors, and their use is generally restricted  to radio and radar transmitting equipment.  [Figure 12-120]  

# Variable Capacitors  

Variable capacitors are mostly used in radio tuning circuits, and  they are sometimes called “tuning capacitors.” They have very  small capacitance values, typically between  $100\,\mathrm{pF}$   and  $500\,\mathrm{pF.}$  .  

# Trimmers  

The trimmer is actually an adjustable or variable capacitor,  which uses ceramic or plastic as a dielectric. Most of them are  color coded to easily recognize their tunable size. The ceramic  type has the value printed on them. Colors are: yellow (5 pF),  blue (7 pF), white   $(10\,\mathrm{pF)}$  , green   $(30\,\mathrm{pF)}$  , and brown   $(60\,\mathrm{pF})$  .  

# Varactors  

A voltage-variable capacitor or varactor is also known as a  variable capacitance diode or a varicap. This device utilizes  the variation of the barrier width in a reversed-biased diode.  Because the barrier width of a diode acts as a non-conductor,  a diode forms a capacitor when reversed biased. Essentially,  the N-type material becomes one plate and the junctions  are the dielectric. If the reversed-bias voltage is increased,  then the barrier width widens, effectively separating the two  capacitor plates and reducing the capacitance.  

# Capacitors in Series  

When capacitors are placed in series, the effective plate  separation is increased and the total capacitance is less  than that of the smallest capacitor. Additionally, the series  

![Figure 12-116.   Strength of some dielectric materials. ](images/180c947d7c7db35e085f7309a753c30c563ee3d5d34b6301e2b734c6341f9de8.jpg)

combination is capable of withstanding a higher total  potential difference than any of the individual capacitors.  Figure 12-121  is a simple series circuit. The bottom plate  of   $\mathrm{C}_{1}$   and the top plate of   $\mathrm{C}_{2}$   is charged by electrostatic  induction. The capacitors charge as current is established  through the circuit. Since this is a series circuit, the current  must be the same at all points. Since the current is the rate  of flow of charge, the amount of charge (Q) stored by each  capacitor is equal to the total charge.  

$$
{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{T}}={\mathrm{Q}}_{1}+{\mathrm{Q}}_{2}+{\mathrm{Q}}_{3}
$$  

According to Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, the sum of the  voltages across the charged capacitors must equal the total  voltage,  $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}.$  . This is expressed as:  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{E}_{1}+\mathrm{E}_{2}+\mathrm{E}_{3}
$$  

Equation  $\mathrm{E=Q/C}$   can now be substituted into the voltage  equation where we now get:  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{T}}}{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{T}}}}={\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{1}}{\mathrm{C}_{1}}}+{\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{2}}{\mathrm{C}_{2}}}+{\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{3}}{\mathrm{C}_{3}}}
$$  

Since the charge on all capacitors is equal, the Q terms can  be factored out, leaving us with the equation:  

$$
\mathrm{\frac{1}{C_{T}}}=\mathrm{\frac{1}{C_{1}}}+\mathrm{\frac{1}{C_{2}}}+\mathrm{\frac{1}{C_{3}}}
$$

Figure 12-118.   Fixed capacitors.  

Leaving us with the equation for capacitors in parallel:  

$$
{\bf C}_{\mathrm{T}}={\bf C}_{1}+{\bf C}_{2}+{\bf C}_{3}
$$  

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{T}}}=\frac{1}{10\;\upmu\mathrm{F}}+\frac{1}{5\;\upmu\mathrm{F}}+\frac{1}{8\;\upmu\mathrm{F}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{If\;C_{1}}=330\;\upmu\mathrm{F},\mathrm{C}_{2}=220\;\upmu\mathrm{F}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{1}{0.425\ \upmu\mathrm{F}}=2.35\ \upmu\mathrm{F}
$$  

# Capacitors in Parallel  

When capacitors are connected in parallel, the effective plate  area increases, and the total capacitance is the sum of the  individual capacitances.  Figure 12-122  shows a simplified  parallel circuit. The total charging current from the source  divides at the junction of the parallel branches. There is  a separate charging current through each branch so that  a different charge can be stored by each capacitor. Using  Kirchhoff’s Current Law, the sum of all of the charging  currents is then equal to the total current. The sum of the  charges (Q) on the capacitors is equal to the total charge.  The voltages (E) across all of the parallel branches are equal.  With all of this in mind, a general equation for capacitors in  parallel can be determined as:  

$$
{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{T}}={\mathrm{Q}}_{1}+{\mathrm{Q}}_{2}+{\mathrm{Q}}_{3}
$$  

Voltages can be factored out because:  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}\,{=}\,\mathrm{E}_{1}+\mathrm{E}_{2}+\mathrm{E}_{3}
$$

Figure 12-119.   Electrolytic capacitors.  

# Capacitors in Alternating Current  

If a source of AC is substituted for the battery, the capacitor  acts quite differently than it does with DC. When AC is  applied in the circuit, the charge on the plates constantly  changes.  [Figure 12-123]  This means that electricity  must flow first from Y clockwise around to X, then from  X counterclockwise around to Y, then from Y clockwise  around to X, and so on. Although no current flows through  the insulator between the plates of the capacitor, it constantly  flows in the remainder of the circuit between X and Y. In  a circuit where there is only capacitance, current leads the  applied voltage as contrasted with a circuit in which there is  inductance, where the current lags the voltage.  

# Capacitive Reactance Xc  

The effectiveness of a capacitor in allowing an AC flow to pass  depends upon the capacitance of the circuit and the applied  frequency. To what degree a capacitor allows an AC flow to  pass depends largely upon the capacitive value of the capacitor  given in farads (f). The greater the capacitance of the capacitor,  the greater the number of electrons, measured in Coulombs,  necessary to bring the capacitor to a fully charged state. Once  the capacitor approaches or actually reaches a fully charged  condition, the polarity of the capacitor opposes the polarity of  the applied voltage, essentially acting then as an open circuit.  To further illustrate this characteristic and how it manifests  itself in an AC circuit, consider the following. If a capacitor has  a large capacitive value, meaning that it requires a relatively  large number of electrons to bring it to a fully charged state,  

![](images/87a17ed112cf4bf09ff9a9bbdcb0f6cae516cc2ce89506cae4c09d3f98c7e6ea.jpg)  
Figure 12-120.   Oil capacitor.  

then a rather high-frequency current can alternate through the  capacitor without the capacitor ever reaching a full charge. In  this case, if the frequency is high enough and the capacitance  large enough that there is never enough time for the capacitor  to ever reach a full charge, it is possible that the capacitor  may offer very little or no resistance to the current. However,  the smaller the capacitance, the fewer electrons are required  to bring it up to a full charge and it is more likely that the  capacitor will build up enough of an opposing charge that it  can present a great deal of resistance to the current if not to the  point of behaving like an open circuit. In between these two  extreme conditions lies a continuum of possibilities of current  opposition depending on the combination of applied frequency  and the selected capacitance. Current in an AC circuit can be  controlled by changing the circuit capacitance in a similar  manner that resistance can control the current. The actual AC  reactance Xc, which just like resistance, is measured in ohms   $(\Omega)$  . Capacitive reactance  $\mathrm{Xc}$   is determined by the following:  

$$
\mathrm{Xc}={\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{fC}}}
$$  

Where	  $\mathrm{Xc}=$   capacitive reactance 	  $\mathbf{f}\!=$  frequency in cps  	  $\mathbf{C}=$   capacity in farads 	  $2\pi=6.28$

To find capacitive reactance, the equation   $\mathrm{Xc}\,=\,1/(2\pi\mathrm{fC})$  is used. First, the capacitance,  $80\;\mathrm{Mf},$  , is changed to farads  by dividing 80 by 1,000,000, since 1 million microfarads is  equal to 1 farad. This quotient equals 0.000080 farad. This

is substituted in the equation and:  

$\mathrm{Xc}={\frac{1}{6.28\times60\times0.000080}}$   $\mathrm{Xc}=33.2$   ohms reactance  

Once the reactance has been determined, Ohm’s Law can  then be used in the same manner as it is used in DC circuits  to determine the current.  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{Current}=\mathrm{~}\frac{\mathrm{Voltan}\mathrm{age}}{\mathrm{Capacity}\mathrm{\;rectandce}},\mathrm{o}}\\ {\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{\frac{E}{Xc}}}\end{array}
$$  

Find the current flow:  

$$
\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{Xc}}}
$$  

# Capacitive Reactances in Series and in Parallel  

When capacitors are connected in series, the total reactance  is equal to the sum of the individual reactances. Thus,  

$$
\mathrm{Xct}=(\mathrm{Xc})_{1}+(\mathrm{Xc})_{2}
$$  

The total reactance of capacitors connected in parallel is  found in the same way total resistance is computed in a  parallel circuit:  

$$
\mathrm{(Xc)t=\frac{1}{\displaystyle\frac{1}{(Xc)_{1}}+\frac{1}{(X c)_{2}}+\frac{1}{(X c)_{3}}}}
$$  

# Phase of Current and Voltage in Reactive Circuits  

Unlike a purely resistive circuit, the capacitive and inductive  reactance has a significant effect on the phase relationship  between the applied AC voltage and the corresponding  

![](images/98df04eb18fb5d8793cbd3b3fe48975a89dd1ce94b5300c46b05b76a95023f2c.jpg)

In review, when current and voltage pass through zero and  reach maximum value at the same time, the current and  voltage are said to be in phase.  [Figure 12-124A]  If the current  and voltage pass through zero and reach the maximum values  at different times, the current and voltage are said to be out  of phase. In a circuit containing only inductance, the current  reaches a maximum value later than the voltage, lagging the  voltage by  $90°$  , or one-fourth cycle.  [Figure 12-124B]  

In a circuit containing only capacitance, the current reaches  its maximum value ahead of the voltage and the current leads  the voltage by  $90°$  , or one-fourth cycle.  [Figure 12-124C]  The  amount the current lags or leads the voltage in a circuit  depends on the relative amounts of resistance, inductance,  and capacitance in the circuit.  

# Inductance  

# Characteristics of Inductance  

Michael Faraday discovered that by moving a magnet through  a coil of wire, a voltage was induced across the coil. If a  complete circuit was provided, then a current was also induced.  The amount of induced voltage is directly proportional to  the rate of change of the magnetic field with respect to the  coil. The simplest of experiments can prove that when a bar  magnet is moved through a coil of wire, a voltage is induced  and can be measured on a voltmeter. This is commonly known  as Faraday’s Law or the Law of Electromagnetic Induction,  which states that the induced emf or electromagnetic force in  a closed loop of wire is proportional to the rate of change of  the magnetic flux through a coil of wire.  

Conversely, current flowing through a coil of wire produces  a magnetic field. When this wire is formed into a coil, it then  becomes a basic inductor. The magnetic lines of force around  each loop or turn in the coil effectively add to the lines of  force around the adjoining loops. This forms a strong magnetic  field within and around the coil.  Figure 12-125A  shows a coil  of wire strengthening a magnetic field. The magnetic lines  of force around adjacent loops are deflected into an outer  path when the loops are brought close together. This happens  

![](images/80dba45aedb2458075502563d49d93f0b5f9bde7117fe4fa06c2087b8beaf2e7.jpg)  
Figure 12-123.   Capacitor in an AC circuit.  

because the magnetic lines of force between adjacent loops  are in opposition with each other. The total magnetic field for  the two loops is shown in  Figure 12-125B . As more loops  are added close together, the strength of the magnetic field  increases.  Figure 12-125C  illustrates the combined effects  of many loops of a coil. The result is a strong electromagnet.  

The primary aspect of the operation of a coil is its property  to oppose any change in current through it. This property  is called inductance. When current flows through any  conductor, a magnetic field starts to expand from the center  of the wire. As the lines of magnetic force grow outward  through the conductor, they induce an emf in the conductor  itself. The induced voltage is always in the direction opposite  to the direction of the current flow. The effects of this  countering emf are to oppose the immediate establishment  of the maximum current. This effect is only a temporary  condition. Once the current reaches a steady value in the  conductor, the lines of magnetic force no longer expand and  the countering emf is no longer present.  

At the starting instant, the countering emf nearly equals the  applied voltage, resulting in a small current flow. However,  as the lines of force move outward, the number of lines  cutting the conductor per second becomes progressively  smaller, resulting in a diminished counter emf. Eventually,  the counter emf drops to zero and the only voltage in  the circuit is the applied voltage and the current is at its  maximum value.  

# The RL Time Constant  

Because the inductors basic action is to oppose a change in  its current, it then follows that the current cannot change  instantaneously in the inductor. A certain time is required  for the current to make a change from one value to another.  The rate at which the current changes is determined by a time  constant represented by the Greek letter  $\tau$  . The time constant  for the RL circuit is:  

$\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\tau}\ =\frac{\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{R}}}\\ {\displaystyle\boldsymbol{\tau}=\mathrm{seconds}}\\ {\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{indentrace\the\(H)}}\\ {\displaystyle\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{distance\(}\Omega\mathrm{)}}\end{array}$  Where  

In a series RL circuit, the current increases to 63 percent of  its full value in 1 time constant after the circuit is closed. This  buildup is similar to the buildup of voltage in a capacitor  when charging an RC circuit. Both follow an exponential  curve and reach 99 percent value after the  $5^{\mathrm{th}}$   time constant.  [Figure 12-126]  

# Physical Parameters  

Some of the physical factors that affect inductance are:  

1.	 The number of turns: Doubling the number of turns  in a coil produces a field twice as strong if the same  current is used. As a general rule, the inductance varies  as the square of the number of turns. 2.	 The cross-sectional area of the coil: The inductance  of a coil increases directly as the cross-sectional area  of the core increases. Doubling the radius of a coil  increases the inductance by a factor of four. 3.	 The length of a coil: Doubling the length of a coil,  while keeping the same number of turns, halves the  value of inductance. 4.	 The core material around which the coil is formed:  Coils are wound on either magnetic or nonmagnetic  materials. Some nonmagnetic materials include air,  copper, plastic, and glass. Magnetic materials include  nickel, iron, steel, or cobalt, which have a permeability  that provides a better path for the magnetic lines of  force and permit a stronger magnetic field.  

# Self-Inductance  

The characteristic of self-inductance was summarized by  German physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1833, and gives the direction  of the induced emf resulting from electromagnetic induction.  This is commonly known as Lenz’s Law, which states: The emf  induced in an electric circuit always acts in such a direction  that the current it drives around a closed circuit produces a  magnetic field, which opposes the change in magnetic flux.  

Self-inductance is the generation of a voltage in an electric  circuit by a changing current in the same circuit. Even  a straight piece of wire has some degree of inductance  because current in a conductor produces a magnetic field.  When the current in a conductor changes direction, there is  a corresponding change in the polarity of the magnetic field  around the conductor. Therefore, a changing current produces  a changing magnetic field around the wire. To further  intensify the magnetic field, the wire can be rolled into a  coil, which is called an inductor. The changing magnetic field  around the inductor induces a voltage across the coil. This  induced emf is called self-inductance and tends to oppose  any change in current within the circuit. This property is  usually called inductance and symbolized with the letter L.  

# Types of Inductors  

Inductors used in radios can range from a straight wire at UHF  to large chokes and transformers used for filtering the ripple  from the output of power supplies and in audio amplifiers.  Figure 12-127  shows the schematic symbols for common  inductors. Values of inductors range from nano-henries to  tens of henries.  

Inductors are classified by the type of core and the method of  

![](images/adac45e7dce2ad2add82ec5a6ae9189152bd5fa43a77fd8bd3c5714a4b090df7.jpg)

winding them. The number of turns in the inductor winding  and the core material determine the capacity of the inductor.  Cores made of dielectric material like ceramics, wood, and  paper provide small amounts of stored energy while cores  made of ferrite substances have a much higher degree of  stored energy. The core material is usually the most important  aspect of the inductors construction. The conductors typically  used in the construction of an inductor offer little resistance  to the flow of current. However, with the introduction of a  core, resistance is introduced in the circuit and the current  now builds up in the windings until the resistance of the core  is overcome. This buildup is stored as magnetic energy in  the core. Depending on the core resistance, the buildup soon  reaches a point of magnetic saturation, and it can be released  when necessary. The most common core materials are: air,  solid ferrite, powdered ferrite, steel, toroid, and ferrite toroid.

Figure 12-125.   Many loops of a coil.  

# Units of Inductance  

The henry is the basic unit of inductance and is symbolized  with the letter H. An electric circuit has an inductance of one  henry when current changing at the rate of one ampere per  second induces a voltage of one volt into the circuit. In many  practical applications, millihenries   $\mathrm{(mH)}$   and microhenries   $(\upmu\mathrm{H})$   are more common units. The typical symbol for an  inductor is shown in  Figure 12-127 .  

# Inductors in Series  

If we connect two inductors in series, the same current flows  through both inductors and, therefore, both are subject to  the same rate of change of current.  [Figure 12-128]  When  inductors are connected in series, the total inductance  $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{T}},$   is  the sum of the individual inductors. The general equation for  n number of inductors in series is:  

$$
\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{T}}\,{=}\,\mathrm{L}_{1}+\mathrm{L}_{2}+\mathrm{L}_{3}+\ldots\,\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{N}}
$$  

# Inductors in Parallel  

When two inductors are connected in parallel, each must  have the same potential difference between the terminals.  [Figure 12-129]  When inductors are connected in parallel,  the total inductance is less than the smallest inductance. The  general equation for n number of inductors in parallel is:  

A simple example would be:  

$$
\mathrm{L}_{1}=10\ \mathrm{mH},\,\mathrm{L}_{2}=5\ \mathrm{mH},\,\mathrm{L}_{3}=2\ \mathrm{mH}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{\DeltaL_{T}=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{10\,\mathrm{mH}}+\frac{1}{5\,\mathrm{mH}}+\frac{1}{2\,\mathrm{mH}}}}}\\ \mathrm{L_{T}=\Delta\frac{1}{0.8\,\mathrm{mH}}}\\ \mathrm{L_{T}=1.25~\mathrm{mH}}\end{array}
$$  

# Inductive Reactance  

Alternating current is in a constant state of change; the effects  of the magnetic fields are a continuously inducted voltage  opposition to the current in the circuit. This opposition  is called inductive reactance, symbolized by   $X_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  , and is  measured in ohms just as resistance is measured. Inductance  is the property of a circuit to oppose any change in current and  is measured in henries. Inductive reactance is a measure of  how much the countering emf in the circuit opposes current  

![](images/87b68ec69988799cac10569400620b27a58c9ed9ae63e346b24b41b1d7fbf320.jpg)  
Figure 12-126.   Inductor curve.  

The inductive reactance of a component is directly  proportional to the inductance of the component and the  applied frequency to the circuit. By increasing either the  inductance or applied frequency, the inductive reactance  likewise increases and presents more opposition to current  in the circuit. This relationship is given as:  

$X_{\mathrm{L}}=2\pi\mathrm{fL}$  Where:  ${\mathrm{X_{L}}}=$  inductive reactance in ohms  $\mathbf{f}=$  = frequency in cycles per second  $\begin{array}{l}{\pi=3.1416}\\ {\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{independence}}\end{array}$  

In  Figure 12-130 , an AC series circuit is shown in which the  inductance is 0.146 henry and the voltage is 110 volts at a  frequency of 60 cps. Inductive reactance is determined by  the following method.  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathrm{X_{L}}}=2\pi\times\mathrm{f}\times\mathrm{L}}\\ {{\mathrm{X_{L}}}=6.28\times60\times0.146}\\ {{\mathrm{X_{L}}}=55~\mathrm{ohm}}\end{array}
$$  

In any circuit where there is only resistance, the expression  for the relationship of voltage and current is given by Ohm’s  Law:  $\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{E}/\mathbf{R}$  . Similarly, when there is inductance in an AC  circuit, the relationship between voltage and current can be  expressed as:  

$$
{\mathrm{Current}}={\frac{\mathrm{Voltan}e}{\mathrm{Reactance}}}{\mathrm{~or~}}\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}}}}
$$  

Where: 	       ${\mathrm{X_{L}}}=$   inductive reactance of the circuit in ohms  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\mathrm I=\mathrm\frac{\mathrm E}{\mathrm X_{\mathrm L}}}\\ {\displaystyle\mathrm I=\frac{110}{55}}\end{array}
$$  

In AC series circuits, inductive reactances are added like  resistances in series in a DC circuit.  [Figure 12-131]  Thus,  the total reactance in the illustrated circuit equals the sum of  

![](images/3a144aab09f0e93568271ce7b408b2de5b20e7bdca9ea9bc3b4a217655f977f0.jpg)  
Figure 12-127.   Typical symbol for an inductor.  

The total reactance of inductors connected in parallel is found  the same way as the total resistance in a parallel circuit.  [Figure 12-132]  Thus, the total reactance of inductances  connected in parallel, as shown, is expressed as:  

$$
(\mathrm{X_{L}})\mathrm{T}=\mathrm{\frac{1}{\displaystyle{\frac{1}{(\mathrm{X_{L}})_{1}}+\frac{1}{(\mathrm{X_{L}})_{2}}+\frac{1}{(\mathrm{X_{L}})_{3}}}}}
$$  

# AC Circuits  

# Ohm’s Law for AC Circuits  

The rules and equations for DC circuits apply to AC circuits  only when the circuits contain resistance alone, as in the case  of lamps and heating elements. In order to use effective values  of voltage and current in AC circuits, the effect of inductance  and capacitance with resistance must be considered.  

The combined effects of resistance, inductive reactance,  and capacitive reactance make up the total opposition to  current flow in an AC circuit. This total opposition is called  impedance and is represented by the letter Z. The unit for  the measurement of impedance is the ohm.  

# Series AC Circuits  

If an AC circuit consists of resistance only, the value of the  impedance is the same as the resistance, and Ohm’s Law for  an AC circuit,  $\mathrm{I}\,{=}\,\mathrm{E}/\mathrm{Z}$  , is exactly the same as for a DC circuit.  In  Figure 12-133,  a series circuit containing a lamp with 11  ohms resistance connected across a source is illustrated. To  find how much current flows if 110 volts DC is applied and  how much current flows if 110 volts AC are applied, the  following examples are solved:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\mathrm{I}=\frac{\mathrm{~E}}{\mathrm{~Z}}\;(\mathrm{where~Z=R})}\\ {\displaystyle\mathrm{I}=\frac{110\,\mathrm{V}}{11\,\mathrm{W}}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{\DeltaI=\frac{E}{R}}
$$  

When AC circuits contain resistance and either inductance  or capacitance, the impedance, Z, is not the same as the  

![](images/49f14fee9056808adb73e90abb28f748a666d31f1d51926ca9c591dda2005e19.jpg)

resistance, R. The impedance of a circuit is the circuit’s  total opposition to the flow of current. In an AC circuit,  this opposition consists of resistance and reactance, either  inductive or capacitive or elements of both.  

Resistance and reactance cannot be added directly, but they  can be considered as two forces acting at right angles to  each other. Thus, the relation between resistance, reactance,  and impedance may be illustrated by a right triangle.  [Figure 12-134]  

Since these quantities may be related to the sides of a right  triangle, the formula for finding the impedance, or total  opposition to current flow in an AC circuit, can be found  by using the law of right triangles. This theorem, called the  Pythagorean theorem, applies to any right triangle. It states  that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the  squares of the other two sides. Thus, the value of any side of a  right triangle can be found if the other two sides are known. If  an AC circuit contains resistance and inductance, as shown in  Figure 12-135 , the relation between the sides can be stated as:  

$$
{\bf Z}^{2}={\bf R}^{2}+{\bf X}_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}
$$  

The square root of both sides of the equation gives  

$$
\mathrm{Z}=\sqrt{\mathrm{R}^{2}+\mathrm{X_{L}}^{2}}
$$  

This formula can be used to determine the impedance when  the values of inductive reactance and resistance are known. It  can be modified to solve for impedance in circuits containing  capacitive reactance and resistance by substituting  $\mathrm{X_{C}}$   in the  formula in place of  $X_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  . In circuits containing resistance with  both inductive and capacitive reactance, the reactances can be  combined, but because their effects in the circuit are exactly  opposite, they are combined by subtraction:  

#  $\mathrm{X=X_{L}-X_{C}}$   or  $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}}$   (the smaller number is 	 always subtracted from the larger)  

In  Figure 12-135 , a series circuit consisting of resistance and  inductance connected in series is connected to a source of  110 volts at 60 cps. The resistive element is a lamp with 6  ohms resistance, and the inductive element is a coil with an  inductance of 0.021 henry. What is the value of the impedance  and the current through the lamp and the coil?  

# Solution:  

First, the inductive reactance of the coil is computed:  

$$
\mathrm{X_{L}}=2\pi\times\mathrm{f}\times\mathrm{L}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{X_{L}}=6.28\times60\times0.021
$$  

Next, the total impedance is computed:  

$\begin{array}{l}{{\mathrm{Z}}=\sqrt{{\mathrm{R}}^{2}+{\mathrm{X_{L}}}^{2}}}\\ {{\mathrm{Z}}=\sqrt{6^{2}+8^{2}}}\\ {{\mathrm{Z}}=\sqrt{36+64}}\\ {{\mathrm{Z}}=\sqrt{100}}\end{array}$   $Z=10$   ohms impedance  

Then the current flow,  

$\mathrm{I}=\frac{\mathrm{~E~}}{\mathrm{~Z~}}$   $\mathrm{I}={\frac{110}{10}}$   $\mathrm{I}=11$   amperes current

Figure 12-131.   Inductances in series.  

The voltage drop across the resistance   $(\mathrm{E}^{\mathbb{R}})$   is:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{E^{R}=I\times R}}\\ {\mathrm{E^{R}=}11\times6=66\;\mathrm{volts}}\end{array}
$$  

The voltage drop across the inductance   $\left(\mathrm{E}X_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$   is:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{EXP}_{\mathrm{L}}=\mathrm{I}\times\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}}}&{{}}\\ {\mathrm{XX}_{\mathrm{L}}=11\times8=88\;\mathrm{volts}}&{{}}\end{array}
$$  

The sum of the two voltages is greater than the impressed  voltage. This results from the fact that the two voltages are  out of phase and, as such, represent the maximum voltage.  If the voltage in the circuit is measured by a voltmeter, it is  approximately 110 volts, the impressed voltage. This can be  proved by the equation:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E}={\sqrt{(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{R}})^{2}+(\mathrm{ES}_{\mathrm{L}})^{2}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E}={\sqrt{66^{2}+88^{2}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E}={\sqrt{4,356+7,744}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E}={\sqrt{12,100}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E}=110\;\mathrm{volts}}\end{array}}
$$  

In  Figure 12-136 , a series circuit is illustrated in which a  capacitor of   $200~\upmu\mathrm{f}$   is connected in series with a 10 ohm  lamp. What is the value of the impedance, the current flow,  and the voltage drop across the lamp?  

# Solution:  

First, the capacitance is changed from microfarads to farads.  Since 1 million microfarads equal 1 farad, then:  

$$
{\begin{array}{l}{200~{\mathrm{\textmu}}{\mathrm{f}}={\frac{200}{1,000,000}}=0.000200{\mathrm{~parads}}}\\ {\mathrm{X_{C}}={\frac{1}{2\pi{\mathrm{f}}C}}}\\ {\mathrm{X_{C}}={\frac{1}{6.28\times60\times0.000200{\mathrm{~parads}}}}}\\ {\mathrm{X_{C}}={\frac{1}{0.07536}}}\end{array}}

The voltage drop across the capacitor   $(\mathrm{EN}_{\mathrm{C}})$   is

Figure 12-135.   A circuit containing resistance and inductance.  

The sum of these two voltages does not equal the applied  voltage, since the current leads the voltage. To find the  applied voltage, use the following formula:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E_{T}\mathrm{=}\sqrt{(E_{R})^{2}+(E X_{C})^{2}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{T}\mathrm{=}\sqrt{67^{2}+86.1^{2}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{T}\mathrm{=}\sqrt{4,489+7,413}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{T}\mathrm{=}\sqrt{11,902}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{T}\mathrm{=}110~v o l t s}}\end{array}
$$  

When the circuit contains resistance, inductance, and  capacitance, the following equation is used to find the  impedance:  

$$
\mathrm{Z}=\sqrt{\mathrm{R}^{2}+(\mathrm{X_{L}}\!-\!\mathrm{X_{C}})^{2}\ }
$$  

Example:  What is the impedance of a series circuit,  consisting of a capacitor with a reactance of 7 ohms, an  inductor with a reactance of 10 ohms, and a resistor with a  resistance of 4 ohms?  [Figure 12-137]  

# Solution:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{R^{2}+(X_{L}-X_{C})^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{4^{2}+(10-7)^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{4^{2}+3^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{25}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z=5\ o h m s}}\end{array}}
$$  

Assuming that the reactance of the capacitor is 10 ohms and  the reactance of the inductor is 7 ohms, then   $\mathrm{X_{C}}$   is greater  than  $X_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  . Thus,  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{R^{2}+(X_{L}-X_{C})^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{4^{2}+(7-10)^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{4^{2}+(-3)^{2}}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{16+9}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{Z={\sqrt{25}}}}\end{array}}
$$  

# Parallel AC Circuits  

The methods used in solving parallel AC circuit problems  are basically the same as those used for series AC circuits.  Out of phase voltages and currents can be added by using  the law of right triangles. However, in solving circuit  problems, the currents through the branches are added since  the voltage drops across the various branches are the same  and are equal to the applied voltage. In  Figure 12-138 , a  parallel AC circuit containing an inductance and a resistance  is shown schematically. The current flowing through the  inductance,  $\mathrm{I_{L}}$  , is 0.0584 ampere, and the current flowing  through the resistance is 0.11 ampere. What is the total  current in the circuit?  

Solution:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{I_{T}}={\sqrt{\mathrm{I_{L}}^{2}+\mathrm{I_{R}}^{2}}}}\\ &{\quad={\sqrt{(0.0584)^{2}+(0.11)^{2}}}}\\ &{\quad={\sqrt{0.0155}}}\\ &{\quad=0.1245{\mathrm{~ampere}}}\end{array}}
$$  

Since inductive reactance causes voltage to lead the current,  the total current, which contains a component of inductive  current, lags the applied voltage. If the current and voltages  are plotted, the angle between the two, called the phase angle,  illustrates the amount the current lags the voltage.  

In  Figure 12-139 , a 112-volt generator is connected to a load  consisting of a  $2\,\upmu\mathrm{f}$  capacitance and a 10,000-ohm resistance  in parallel. What is the value of the impedance and total  current flow?  

# Solution:  

First, find the capacitive reactance of the circuit:  

$$
\mathrm{X_{C}}={\frac{1}{2\pi\mathrm{fC}}}
$$  

Changing   $2~\upmu\mathrm{f}$  to farads and entering the values into the  formula given:

$$  

To find the impedance, the impedance formula used in a  series AC circuit must be modified to fit the parallel circuit:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\qquad{\mathrm{\Delta}}\mathrm{RX}_{\mathrm{C}}}\\ &{\quadZ={\sqrt{\mathrm{R}^{2}+{X_{\mathrm{C}}}^{2}}}}\\ &{\quad={\sqrt{(10,000\times1,327\,}}}\\ &{\quad={\sqrt{(10,000)^{2}+(1,327)^{2}}}}\\ &{\quad=0.1315\ \mathrm{W}\ ({\mathrm{approximation}})}\end{array}}
$$  

To find the current through the capacitance:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{I_{C}=\frac{E}{\Delta X_{C}}}}\\ &{\mathrm{I_{C}=\frac{110}{1,327}}}\\ &{\mathrm{\Omega=0.0829\;am}}\end{array}}
$$  

To find the current flowing through the resistance:  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{I_{R}=\frac{\Delta E}{R}}}\\ &{\quad=\frac{110}{10{,}000}}\\ &{\quad=0.011\ \mathrm{am}}\end{array}}
$$  

To find the total current in the circuit:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{{\mathrm{I_{T}}}^{2}=\sqrt{{\mathrm{I_{R}}}^{2}+{\mathrm{I_{C}}}^{2}}}\\ &{\mathrm{I_{T}}\ =\sqrt{{\mathrm{I_{L}}}^{2}+{\mathrm{I_{R}}}^{2}}}\\ &{\ \ \ =0.0836\;\mathrm{ampere}\;(\mathrm{approxedmited})}\end{array}
$$  

# Resonance  

It has been shown that both inductive reactance:  

$$
(\mathrm{X_{L}}=2\pi\mathrm{fL})
$$  

and capacitive reactance:  

$$
\mathrm{X_{C}}={\frac{1}{\ 2\pi{\mathrm{fC}}\ }}
$$  

are functions of an AC frequency. Decreasing the frequency  decreases the ohmic value of the inductive reactance, but a  decrease in frequency increases the capacitive reactance. At  some particular frequency, known as the resonant frequency,  the reactive effects of a capacitor and an inductor is equal.  

![](images/b659e15fdc7dda2b684ebc79fbf4a2efe6321d773c3d077523ad060f5c61c3e1.jpg)  
Figure 12-137.   A circuit containing resistance, inductance, and  capacitance.  

Since these effects are the opposite of one another, they will  cancel, leaving only the ohmic value of the resistance to  oppose current flow in a circuit. If the value of resistance is  small or consists only of the resistance in the conductors, the  value of current flow can become very high.  

In a circuit where the inductor and capacitor are in series,  and the frequency is the resonant frequency, or frequency  of resonance, the circuit is said to be “in resonance” and  is referred to as a series resonant circuit. The symbol for  resonant frequency is Fn.  

If, at the frequency of resonance, the inductive reactance is  equal to the capacitive reactance, then:  

$$
\mathrm{X_{L}}=\mathrm{X_{C}},\,\mathrm{or}\,\,
$$  

Dividing both sides by 2 fL,  

$$
\mathrm{Fn}2=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)2\mathrm{LC}}
$$  

Extracting the square root of both sides gives:  

$$
\mathrm{Fn}={\frac{1}{\,2\pi\ {\sqrt{\mathrm{LC}}}\,}}
$$  

Where Fn is the resonant frequency in cps, C is the  capacitance in farads, and   $\mathrm{L}$   is the inductance in henries.  With this formula, the frequency at which a capacitor and  inductor is resonant can be determined.  

To find the inductive reactance of a circuit use:  

$$
X_{\mathrm{L}}=2\pi\mathrm{fL}
$$  

The impedance formula used in a series AC circuit must be  modified to fit a parallel circuit.  

![](images/de4b7f90b4977c72be9419a5b3726f9c825a2860c6ecf085b435b224b40441b8.jpg)  
Figure 12-138.   AC parallel circuit containing inductance and  resistance.  

$$
\mathrm{Z}=\sqrt{\mathrm{R}^{2}=\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}}{}^{2}}
$$  

To find the parallel networks of inductance and capacitive  reactors, use:  

$$
\mathrm{X_{L}+X_{C}}
$$  

To find the parallel networks with resistance capacitive and  inductance, use:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{R\,X_{L}\,X_{C}}\qquad\qquad}\\ {\mathrm{Z=\sqrt{{X_{L}}^{2}\,{X_{C}}^{2}+(R{X_{L}}-R{X_{C}})^{2}\qquad}}}\end{array}
$$  

Since at the resonant frequency  $X_{\mathrm{{L}}}$   cancels  $\mathrm{X_{C}}$  , the current can  become very large, depending on the amount of resistance. In  such cases, the voltage drop across the inductor or capacitor  is often higher than the applied voltage.  

![](images/e3ff65814ec5dc6b0ba1991561ad548012771e546a6ec8dc046c0150bb486d05.jpg)  
Figure 12-139.   A parallel  $_{A C}$   circuit containing capacitance and  resistance.  

In a parallel resonant circuit, the reactances are equal and  equal currents flow through the coil and the capacitor.  [Figure 12-140]  

Since the inductive reactance causes the current through the  coil to lag the voltage by  $90°$  , and the capacitive reactance  causes the current through the capacitor to lead the voltage  by  $90°$  , the two currents are  $180^{\circ}$   out of phase. The canceling  effect of such currents would mean that no current would  flow from the generator and the parallel combination of  the inductor and the capacitor would appear as infinite  impedance. In practice, no such circuit is possible, since some  value of resistance is always present, and the parallel circuit,  sometimes called a tank circuit, acts as very high impedance.  It is also called an antiresonant circuit, since its effect in a  circuit is opposite to that of a series resonant circuit, in which  the impedance is very low.  

# Power in AC Circuits  

In a DC circuit, power is obtained by the equation,   $\mathbf{P}=\mathrm{El}$  ,  (watts equal volts  $\times$   amperes). Thus, if 1 ampere of current  flows in a circuit at a pressure of 200 volts, the power is 200  watts. The product of the volts and the amperes is the true  power in the circuit.  

# True Power Defined  

True power of any AC circuit is commonly referred to as  the working power of the circuit. True power is the power  consumed by the resistance portion of the circuit and is  measured in watts. True power is symbolized by the letter P  and is indicated by any wattmeter in the circuit. True power  is calculated by the formula:  

$$
\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{I}^{2}\times\mathrm{Z}
$$  

# Apparent Power Defined  

Apparent power in an AC circuit is sometimes referred to as  the reactive power of a circuit. Apparent power is the power  consumed by the entire circuit, including both the resistance  and the reactance. Apparent power is symbolized by the letter  S and is measured in volt-amps (VA). Apparent power is a  product of the effective voltage multiplied by the effective  current. Apparent power is calculated by the formula:  

$$
\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{I}^{2}\times\mathbf{Z}
$$  

Only when the AC circuit is made up of pure resistance is  the apparent power equal to the true power.  [Figure 12-141] When there is capacitance or inductance in the circuit, the  current and voltage are not exactly in phase, and the true  power is less than the apparent power. The true power is  obtained by a wattmeter reading. The ratio of the true power  to the apparent power is called the power factor and is usually  expressed in percent. In equation form, the relationship is:  

$100\;\times$   watts (True Power) Power Factor (PF) = volts  $\times$   amperes (Apparent Power)  

Example:  A 220-volt AC motor takes 50 amperes from the  line, but a wattmeter in the line shows that only 9,350 watts  are taken by the motor. What are the apparent power and the  power factor?  

# Solution:  

$$
\begin{array}{l c l}{\mathrm{(PF)}=\cfrac{\mathrm{Watts}\left(\mathrm{True\;Power}\right)\times100}{\mathrm{VA}\left(\mathrm{apparent\;Power}\right)}}\\ {\mathrm{(PF)}=\cfrac{9,350\times100}{11,000}}\end{array}
$$  

$$
(\mathrm{PF})=85,\,\mathrm{or}\,\,85\%
$$  

# Transformers  

A transformer changes electrical energy of a given voltage  into electrical energy at a different voltage level. It consists of  two coils that are not electrically connected, but are arranged  so that the magnetic field surrounding one coil cuts through  the other coil. When an alternating voltage is applied to  (across) one coil, the varying magnetic field set up around that  coil creates an alternating voltage in the other coil by mutual  induction. A transformer can also be used with pulsating DC,  but a pure DC voltage cannot be used, since only a varying  voltage creates the varying magnetic field that is the basis  of the mutual induction process.  

A transformer consists of three basic parts.  [Figure 12-142]  These are an iron core, which provides a circuit of low  reluctance for magnetic lines of force; a primary winding,  which receives the electrical energy from the source of applied  voltage; and a secondary winding, which receives electrical  energy by induction from the primary coil.  

The primary and secondary of this closed core transformer  are wound on a closed core to obtain maximum inductive  effect between the two coils.  

There are two classes of transformers: voltage transformers,  used for stepping up or stepping down voltages; and  current transformers used in instrument circuits. In voltage  transformers, the primary coils are connected in parallel  across the supply voltage.  [Figure 12-143A]  The primary  windings of current transformers are connected in series in  the primary circuit.  [Figure 12-143B]  Of the two types, the  voltage transformer is the more common.  

There are many types of voltage transformers. Most of these  are either step-up or step-down transformers. The factor  that determines whether a transformer is a step-up or step- down type is the “turns” ratio. The turns ratio is the ratio of  the number of turns in the primary winding to the number  of turns in the secondary winding. For example, the turns  ratio of the step-down transformer is 5 to 1, since there are  five times as many turns in the primary as in the secondary.  [Figure 12-144A]  The step-up transformer has a 1 to 4 turns  ratio.  [Figure 12-144B]  

The ratio of the transformer input voltage to the output  voltage is the same as the turns ratio if the transformer is  100 percent efficient. Thus, when 10 volts are applied to  the primary of the transformer, two volts are induced in the  secondary.  [Figure 12-144A]  If 10 volts are applied to the  primary of the transformer, the output voltage across the  terminals of the secondary is 40 volts.  [Figure 12-144B]  

No transformer can be constructed that is 100 percent  efficient, although iron core transformers can approach this  figure. This is because all the magnetic lines of force set up  in the primary do not cut across the turns of the secondary  coil. A certain amount of the magnetic flux, called leakage  flux, leaks out of the magnetic circuit. The measure of how  well the flux of the primary is coupled into the secondary  is called the “coefficient of coupling.” For example, if it is  assumed that the primary of a transformer develops 10,000  lines of force and only 9,000 cut across the secondary, the  coefficient of coupling would be 0.9. Stated another way, the  transformer would be 90 percent efficient.  

When an AC voltage is connected across the primary terminals  of a transformer, an AC flows and self induces a voltage in the  primary coil that is opposite and nearly equal to the applied  voltage. The difference between these two voltages allows  just enough current in the primary to magnetize its core. This  is called the exciting, or magnetizing, current. The magnetic  field caused by this exciting current cuts across the secondary  coil and induces a voltage by mutual induction.  

If a load is connected across the secondary coil, the load current  flowing through the secondary coil produces a magnetic field  that tends to neutralize the magnetic field produced by the  primary current. This reduces the self-induced (opposition)  voltage in the primary coil and allows more primary current  

![](images/a9c05df0f861c0bd91d1714ea504955f6bbb5968df4b9486dd7c95f13e4c727a.jpg)  
Figure 12-140.   A parallel resonant circuit.  

to flow. The primary current increases as the secondary load  current increases, and decreases as the secondary load current  decreases. When the secondary load is removed, the primary  current is again reduced to the small exciting current sufficient  only to magnetize the iron core of the transformer.  

If a transformer steps up the voltage, it steps down the current  by the same ratio. This should be evident if the power formula  is considered, for the power  $(\mathrm{I\timesE})$   of the output (secondary)  electrical energy is the same as the input (primary) power  minus that energy loss in the transforming process. Thus,  if 10 volts and 4 amps (40 watts of power) are used in the  primary to produce a magnetic field, there is 40 watts of  power developed in the secondary (disregarding any loss).  If the transformer has a step-up ratio of 4 to 1, the voltage  across the secondary is 40 volts and the current is 1 amp. The  voltage is 4 times greater and the current is one-fourth the  primary circuit value, but the power (  $\mathrm{I}\times\mathrm{E}$   value) is the same.  

When the turns ratio and the input voltage are known, the  output voltage can be determined as follows:  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{E}_{2}}{\mathrm{E}_{1}}}={\frac{\mathrm{N}_{2}}{\mathrm{N}_{1}}}
$$  

Where  $\mathrm{E}$   is the voltage of the primary,  $\mathrm{E}_{2}$   is the output voltage  of the secondary, and  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$   and  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$   are the number of turns of  the primary and secondary, respectively.  

Transposing the equation to find the output voltage gives:  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{2}=\ \frac{\mathrm{E}_{1}\,\mathrm{N}_{2}}{\mathrm{N}_{1}}\,
$$  

The most commonly used types of voltage transformers are:  

1.	 Power transformers are used to step up or step down  voltages and current in many types of power supplies.  They range in size from the small power transformer  [Figure 12-145]  used in a radio receiver to the large  transformers used to step down high power line

voltage to the 110–120 volt level used in homes.  

Figure 12-146  shows the schematic symbol for an  iron core transformer. In this case, the secondary is  made up of three separate windings. Each winding  supplies a different circuit with a specific voltage,  which saves the weight, space, and expense of three  separate transformers. Each secondary has a midpoint  connection called a “center tap,” which provides a  selection of half the voltage across the whole winding.  The leads from the various windings are color coded  by the manufacturer.  [Figure 12-146]  This is a standard  color code, but other codes or numbers may be used.  

2.	 Audio transformers resemble power transformers. They  have only one secondary and are designed to operate  over the range of audio frequencies (20 to 20,000 cps).  

3.	 RF transformers are designed to operate in equipment  that functions in the radio range of frequencies. The  symbol for the RF transformer is the same as for an RF  choke coil. It has an air core as shown in  Figure 12-147 .  

4.	 Auto transformers are normally used in power circuits;  however, they may be designed for other uses. Two  different symbols for auto transformers used in power  or audio circuits are shown in  Figure 12-148 . If  used in an RF communication or navigation circuit  [Figure 12-148B] , it is the same, except there is no  symbol for an iron core. The autotransformer uses  part of a winding as a primary; and, depending on  whether it is step up or step down, it uses all or part  of the same winding as the secondary. For example,  the autotransformer shown in  Figure 12-148A  could  use the following possible choices for primary and  secondary terminals.

# Current Transformers  

Current transformers are used in AC power supply systems  to sense generator line current and to provide a current,  proportional to the line current, for circuit protection and  control devices.  

The current transformer is a ring-type transformer using a  current carrying power lead as a primary (either the power  lead or the ground lead of the AC generator). The current in  

![](images/20102bb8a792f9c45346e3ddf747a3e348d5c5722ebde38160ed38278d0f5739.jpg)  
Figure 12-144.   A step-down and a step-up transformer.  

the primary induces a current in the secondary by magnetic  induction. The sides of all current transformers are marked  “H1” and “H2” on the unit base. The transformers must  be installed with the “H1” side toward the generator in the  circuit in order to have proper polarity. The secondary of the  transformer should never be left open while the system is being  operated; to do so could cause dangerously high voltages and  could overheat the transformer. Therefore, the transformer  output connections should always be connected with a jumper  when the transformer is not being used but is left in the system.  

# Transformer Losses  

In addition to the power loss caused by imperfect coupling,  transformers are subject to “copper” and “iron” losses. The  resistance of the conductor comprising the turns of the coil  causes copper loss. The iron losses are of two types: hysteresis  loss and eddy current loss. Hysteresis loss is the electrical  energy required to magnetize the transformer core, first in  one direction and then in the other, in step with the applied  alternating voltage. Eddy current loss is caused by electric  currents (eddy currents) induced in the transformer core by  the varying magnetic fields. To reduce eddy current losses,  cores are made of laminations coated with an insulation,  which reduces the circulation of induced currents.  

# Power in Transformers  

Since a transformer does not add any electricity to the circuit  but merely changes or transforms the electricity that already  exists in the circuit from one voltage to another, the total  amount of energy in a circuit must remain the same. If it were  possible to construct a perfect transformer, there would be no  loss of power in it; power would be transferred undiminished  from one voltage to another.  

Since power is the product of volts times amperes, an increase  in voltage by the transformer must result in a decrease in  current and vice versa. There cannot be more power in the  secondary side of a transformer than there is in the primary.  The product of amperes times volts remains the same.  

The transmission of power over long distances is accomplished  by using transformers. At the power source, the voltage is  stepped up in order to reduce the line loss during transmission.  At the point of utilization, the voltage is stepped down, since  it is not feasible to use high voltage to operate motors, lights,  or other electrical appliances.  

# DC Measuring Instruments  

Understanding the functional design and operation of  electrical measuring instruments is very important, since  they are used in repairing, maintaining, and troubleshooting  electrical circuits. The best and most expensive measuring  instrument is of no use unless the technician knows what is  being measured and what each reading indicates. The purpose  of the meter is to measure quantities existing in a circuit. For  this reason, when a meter is connected to a circuit, it must  not change the characteristics of that circuit.  

Meters are either self-excited or externally excited. Those that  are self-excited operate from a power source within the meter.  Externally-excited meters get their power source from the  circuit that they are connected to. The most common analog  meters in use today are the voltmeter, ammeter, and ohmmeter.  All of which operate on the principles of electromagnetism.  The fundamental principle behind the operation of the meter  is the interaction between magnetic fields created by a current  gathered from the circuit in some manner. This interaction is  between the magnetic fields of a permanent magnet and the  coils of a rotating magnet. The greater the current through the  coils of the rotating magnet, the stronger the magnetic field  produced. A stronger field produces greater rotation of the coil.  While some meters can be used for both DC and AC circuit  measurement, only those used as DC instruments are discussed  in this section. The meters used for AC, or for both AC and  DC, are discussed in the study of AC theory and circuitry.  

# D’Arsonval Meter Movement  

This basic DC type of meter movement—first employed  by the French scientist, d’Arsonval, in making electrical  measurement—is a current measuring device, which is  used in the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter. The pointer  is deflected in proportion to the amount of current through  the coil. Basically, both the ammeter and the voltmeter are  current measuring instruments, the principal difference being  the method in which they are connected in a circuit. While an  ohmmeter is also basically a current measuring instrument,  it differs from the ammeter and voltmeter in that it provides  its own source (self-excited) of power and contains other  auxiliary circuits.

# Current Sensitivity and Resistance  

The current sensitivity of a meter movement is the amount of  current required to drive the meter movement to a full-scale  deflection. A simple example would be a meter movement  that has   $1\ \mathrm{mA}$   sensitivity. What this indicates is that meter  movement requires   $1\ \mathrm{mA}$   of current to move the needle to  a full-scale indication. Likewise, a half-scale deflection  requires only  $0.5\,\mathrm{mA}$   of current. Additionally, what is called  

![](images/0a78e619a95dfbf93277f99942bca29cf056eae2dd417d55a53edd86fba85fa1.jpg)  
Figure 12-148.   Auto transformers.  

movement resistance is the actual DC resistance of the wire  used to construct the meter coil.  

In a standard d’Arsonval meter, movement may have a  current sensitivity of   $1\;\mathrm{mA}$   and a resistance of   $50\;\Omega$  . If the  meter is going to be used to measure more than  $1\;\mathrm{mA}$  , then  additional circuitry is required to accomplish the task. This  additional circuitry is a simple shunt resistor. The purpose  of the shunt resistor is to bypass current that exceeds the   $1\;\mathrm{mA}$   limitation of the meter movement. To illustrate this,  assume that the 1 mA meter in question is needed to measure   $10~\mathrm{mA}$  . The shunt resistor used should carry   $9\ \mathrm{mA}$   while  the remaining   $1\ \mathrm{mA}$   is allowed to pass through the meter.  [Figure 12-149]  

To determine the proper shunt resistance for this situation:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SH}}=\mathrm{Shunt}\;\mathrm{resdistance}}\\ &{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}=\mathrm{Meter}\;\mathrm{resdistance}=50\;\Omega}\end{array}
$$  

Because the shunt resistance and the  $50\,\Omega$   meter resistance are  in parallel, the voltage drop across both of them is the same.  

$$
\mathrm{E_{SH}=E_{M}}
$$  

Using Ohm’s Law, this relationship can be rewritten as:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E_{SH}=I_{S H}\times R_{S H}}}\\ &{\mathrm{E_{M}=I_{M}\times R_{M}}}\\ &{\mathrm{I_{SH}\times R_{S H}=I_{M}\times R_{M}}}\end{array}
$$  

Simply solve for   $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SH}}$  

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{SH}}={\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{M}}\times\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{SH}}}}
$$  

Substituting the values  

$$
\mathrm{R_{SH}}={\frac{I m A\times50\,\Omega}{9\,m A}}\,=5.56\,\Omega
$$  

# Damping  

To make meter readings quickly and accurately, it is  desirable that the moving pointer overshoot its proper  position only a small amount and come to rest after not more  than one or two small oscillations. The term “damping” is  applied to methods used to bring the pointer of an electrical  meter to rest after it has been set in motion. Damping may  be accomplished by electrical means, by mechanical means,  or by a combination of both.  

# Electrical Damping  

A common method of damping by electrical means is to wind  the moving coil on an aluminum frame. As the coil moves  in the field of the permanent magnet, eddy currents are set  up in the aluminum frame. The magnetic field produced by  the eddy currents opposes the motion of the coil. The pointer  therefore swings more slowly to its proper position and comes  to rest quickly with very little oscillation.  

# Mechanical Damping  

Air damping is a common method of damping by mechanical  means. As shown in  Figure 12-150 , a vane is attached to the  shaft of the moving element and enclosed in an air chamber.  The movement of the shaft is retarded because of the  resistance that the air offers to the vane. Effective damping is  achieved if the vane nearly touches the walls of the chamber.  

# A Basic Multirange Ammeter  

Building upon the basic meter previously discussed is the more  complex and useful multirange meter, which is more practical.  The basic idea of a multirange ammeter is to make the meter  usable over a wide range of voltages. In order to accomplish  this, each range must utilize a different shunt resistance. The  example given in this handbook is that of a two-range meter.  However, once the basics of a two-range multirange ammeter  are understood, the concepts can easily be transferred to the  design of meters with many selectable ranges.  

Figure 12-151  shows the schematic of an ammeter with two  selectable ranges. This example builds upon the previous   $10~\mathrm{mA}$   range meter by adding a   $100~\mathrm{mA}$   range. With the  switch selected to the   $10~\mathrm{mA}$   range, the meter indicates   $10\,\mathrm{mA}$   when the needle is deflected to full-scale and likewise  indicates   $100\,\mathrm{mA}$   at full-scale when selected to   $100\,\mathrm{mA}$  . The  value of the   $100~\mathrm{mA}$   shunt resistor is determined the same  way the   $10~\mathrm{mA}$   shunt resistor was determined. Recall that  the meter movement can only carry  $1\;\mathrm{mA}$  . This means that  in a  $100\,\mathrm{mA}$   range the remaining current of  $99\,\mathrm{mA}$   must pass  through the shunt resistor.  

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{SH}}={\frac{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{M}}\times\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{M}}}{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{SH}}}}
$$  

Substituting the values:  

$$
\mathrm{R_{SH}}=\frac{\ l m A\times50\;\Omega}{99\;\mathrm{mA}}=0.51\;\Omega
$$  

# Precautions  

The precautions to observe when using an ammeter are  summarized as follows:  

1.	 Always connect ammeter in series with the element  

through which the current flow is to be measured.  

2.	 Never connect an ammeter across a source of voltage,  such as a battery or generator. Remember that the  resistance of an ammeter, particularly on the higher  ranges, is extremely low and that any voltage, even a  volt or so, can cause very high current to flow through  the meter, causing damage to it.  

3.	 Use a range large enough to keep the deflection less  than full-scale. Before measuring a current, form  some idea of its magnitude. Then switch to a large  enough scale or start with the highest range and  work down until the appropriate scale is reached. The  most accurate readings are obtained at approximately  half-scale deflection. Many milliammeters have been  ruined by attempts to measure amperes. Therefore,  be sure to read the lettering either on the dial or on  the switch positions and choose proper scale before  connecting the meter in the circuit.  

4.	 Observe proper polarity in connecting the meter in the  circuit. Current must flow through the coil in a definite  direction in order to move the indicator needle up  scale. Current reversal because of incorrect connection  in the circuit results in a reversed meter deflection and  frequently causes bending of the meter needle. Avoid  improper meter connections by observing the polarity  markings on the meter.

# The Voltmeter  

The voltmeter uses the same type of meter movement as  the ammeter but employs a different circuit external to the  meter movement.  

As shown before, the voltage drop across the meter coil  is a function of current and the coil resistance. In another  example,  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}\times1{,}000\,\Omega\,{=}\,50\,\mathrm{mV}.$   In order for the meter to  be used to measure voltages greater than   $50\,\mathrm{mV},$   there must  be added a series resistance to drop any excess voltage greater  than that which the meter movement requires for a full-scale  deflection. The case of the voltmeter, this resistance is called  multiplier resistance and is designated as  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}$  . [ Figure 12-152] The voltmeter only has one multiplier resistor for use in one  range. In this example, the full-scale reading is 1 volt.  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}$   is  determined in the following way:  

The meter movement drops   $50\,\mathrm{mV}$   at a full-scale deflection of   $50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}$  . The multiplying resistor  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}$   must drop the remaining  voltage of   $1\,\mathrm{V}-50\,\mathrm{mV}\,{=}\,950\,\mathrm{mV}.$   Since  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}$   is in series with  the movement, it also carries   $50~\upmu\mathrm{A}$   at full scale.  

$$
\mathrm{RM}={\frac{950\;\mathrm{mV}}{50\;\upmu\mathrm{A}}}=19\mathrm{k}\;\Omega
$$  

Therefore, for 1 volt full-scale deflection, the total resistance  of the voltmeter is  $20\mathbf{k}\,\Omega$  . That is, the multiplier resistance  and the coil resistance.  

# Voltmeter Sensitivity  

Voltmeter sensitivity is defined in terms of resistance per  volt   $(\Omega/\mathrm{V})$  . The meter used in the previous example has a  sensitivity of  $20\mathbf{k}\,\Omega$   and a full-scale deflection of 1 volt.  

# Multiple Range Voltmeters  

The simplified voltmeter in  Figure 12-152  has only one range  (1 volt), which means that it can measure voltages from 0  volts to 1 volt. In order for the meter to be more useful,  additional multiplier resistors must be used. One resistor  must be used for each desired range.  

For a   $50~\upmu\mathrm{A}$   movement, the total resistance required is   $20\mathbf{k}$   $\Omega$   for each volt of full-scale reading. In other words, the  sensitivity for a  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}$   movement is always  $20\mathbf{k}\,\Omega$   regardless  of the selected range. The full-scale meter current is  $50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}$   at  any range selection. To find the total meter resistance, multiply  the sensitivity by the full-scale voltage for that particular range.  

For example for a 10 volt range,  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}{=}(20\mathrm{k}\Omega/\mathrm{V})(10\mathrm{V}){=}200\mathrm{k}\Omega$  .  The total resistance for the 1 volt range is  $20\mathbf{k}\,\Omega$  , so  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{M}}$   for  a  $10\;\mathrm{V}$   range is 200k  $:\Omega-20\mathbf{k}$   $\Omega=180\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$  .  [Figure 12-153]

# Voltmeter Circuit Connections  

When voltmeters are used, they are connected in parallel  with a circuit. If unsure about the voltage to be measured,  take the first reading at the high value on the meter and then  progressively move down through the range until a suitable  read is obtained. Observe that the polarity is correct before  connecting the meter to the circuit or damage occurs by  driving the movement backwards.  

# Influence of the Voltmeter in the Circuit  

When a voltmeter is connected across two points in a circuit,  current is shunted. If the voltmeter has low resistance, it draws  off a significant amount of current. This lowers the effective  resistance of the circuit and change the voltage readings.  When making a voltage measurement, use a high resistance  voltmeter to prevent shunting of the circuit.

# The Ohmmeter  

The meter movement used for the ammeter and the voltmeter  can also be used for the ohmmeter. The function of the  ohmmeter is to measure resistance. A simplified one-stage  ohmmeter is illustrated in  Figure 12-154 , which shows that  the basic ohmmeter contains a battery and a variable resistor  in series with the meter movement. To measure resistance, the  leads of the meter are connected across an external resistance,  which is to be measured. By doing this, the ohmmeter circuit  is completed. This connection allows the internal battery  to produce a current through the movement coil, causing  a deflection of the pointer proportional to the value of the  external resistance being measured.  

# Zero Adjustment  

When the ohmmeter leads are open, the meter is at a full-scale  deflection, indicating an infinite   $(\infty)$   resistance or an open  circuit.  [Figure 12-155]  When the leads are shorted as shown  in figure “zero adjust,” the pointer is at the full right-hand  position, indicating a short circuit or zero resistance. The  purpose of the variable resistor in this figure is to adjust the  current so that the pointer is at exactly zero when the leads  are shorted. This is used to compensate for changes in the  internal battery voltage due to aging.  

# Ohmmeter Scale  

Figure 12-156  shows a typical analog ohmmeter scale.  Between zero and infinity   $(\infty)$  , the scale is marked to indicate  various resistor values. Because the values decrease from left  to right, this scale is often called a back-off scale.  

In the case of the example given, assume that a certain  ohmmeter uses a   $50~\upmu\mathrm{A}$  ,   $1{,}000\;\Omega$   meter movement and has  an internal 1.5 volt battery. A current of   $50~\upmu\mathrm{A}$   produces a  full-scale deflection when the test leads are shorted. To have   $50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}$  , the total ohmmeter resistance is   $1.5\,\mathrm{V}/50\,\upmu\mathrm{A}\!=\!30\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$  .  Therefore, since the coil resistance is   $1\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$  , the variable zero  adjustment resistor must be set to   $30\mathrm{k}\;\Omega-1\mathrm{k}\;\Omega=29\mathrm{k}\;\Omega$  .  

Now consider that a   $120\mathbf{k}~\Omega$   resistor is connected to  the ohmmeter leads. Combined with the   $30\mathbf{k}~\Omega$   internal  resistance, the total  $\mathrm{R}$   is   $150\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$  . The current is   $1.5\;\mathrm{V}/150\mathrm{k}$   $\Omega=10~\upmu\mathrm{A}$  , which is 20 percent of the full-scale current and  appears on the scale shown in  Figure 12-156 .  

Now consider further that a   $120\mathbf{k}\,\Omega$   resistor is connected to  the ohmmeter leads. This results in a current of  $1.5\,\mathrm{V}/75\mathrm{k}\,\Omega\!=$   $10~\upmu\mathrm{A}$  , which is 40 percent of the full-scale current and  marked on the scale. Additional calculations of this type  show that the scale is nonlinear. It is more compressed  toward the left side than the right side. The center scale point  corresponds to the internal meter resistance of   $30\mathbf{k}\;\Omega$  . The  reason is as follows:  

With  $30\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$   connected to the leads, the current is  $1.5\,\mathrm{V}/60\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$   $=25~\upmu\mathrm{A}$  , which is half of the full-scale current of  $50~\upmu\mathrm{A}$  .  

# The Multirange Ohmmeter  

A practical ohmmeter has several operational ranges. These  typically are indicated by   $\mathrm{R\times1}$  ,  $\mathrm{R}\times10$  ,  $\mathrm{R}\times100$  ,  $\mathbf{R}\times1\mathbf{k}$   $\mathrm{R}\times100\mathrm{k}$   and  $\mathrm{R}\times1\mathrm{M}$  . These range selections are interpreted  in a different manner than that of an ammeter or voltmeter.  The reading on the ohmmeter scale is multiplied by the factor  indicated by the range setting. For example, if the pointer is  set on the scale and the range switch is set at   $\mathrm{R}\times100$  , the  actual resistance measurement is  $20\times100$   or   $2\mathrm{k}\,\Omega$  .  

To measure small resistance values, the technician must use  a higher ohmmeter current than is needed for measuring  large resistance values. Shunt resistors are needed to provide  multiple ranges on the ohmmeter to measure a range of  resistance values from the very small to very large. For each  range, a different value of shunt resistance is switched in.  The shunt resistance increases for higher ohm ranges and  is always equal to the center scale reading on any selected  range. In some meters, a higher battery voltage is used for  the highest ohm range.  [Figure 12-157]  

# Megger (Megohmmeter)  

The megger, or megohmmeter, is a high range ohmmeter  containing a hand-operated generator. It is used to measure  insulation resistance and other high-resistance values. It is  also used for ground, continuity, and short-circuit testing of  electrical power systems. The chief advantage of the megger  over an ohmmeter is its capacity to measure resistance with a  high potential, or “breakdown” voltage. This type of testing  ensures that insulation or a dielectric material will not short  or leak under potential electrical stress.  

The megger consists of two primary elements, both of which  are provided with individual magnetic fields from a common  permanent magnet: a hand-driven DC generator, G, which  supplies the necessary current for making the measurement;  and the instrument portion, which indicates the value of the  resistance being measured. The instrument portion is of the  opposed coil type. Coils A and B are mounted on the movable  member with a fixed angular relationship to each other and  are free to turn as a unit in a magnetic field. Coil B tends to  

![](images/b7e6bd4753c0e941bdfe202ef7bb745023c77bfb2452649e80bb3aca61923703.jpg)  
Figure 12-152.   Basic voltmeter.  

move the pointer counterclockwise and coil A, clockwise. The  coils are mounted on a light, movable frame that is pivoted in  jewel bearings and free to move about axis 0.  [Figure 12-158]  

Coil A is connected in series with R3 and the unknown  resistance,   $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{X}}$  , to be measured. The series combination of  coil A, R3, and  $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{X}}$   is connected between the  $^+$   and − brushes  of the DC generator. Coil B is connected in series with R2,  and this combination is also connected across the generator.  There are no restraining springs on the movable member of  the instrument portion of the megger. When the generator is  not in operation, the pointer floats freely and may come to  rest at any position on the scale.  

If the terminals are open circuited, no current flows in coil  A, and the current in coil B alone controls the movement  of the moving element. Coil B takes a position opposite  the gap in the core (since the core cannot move and coil B  can), and the pointer indicates infinity on the scale. When a  resistance is connected between the terminals, current flows  in coil A, tending to move the pointer clockwise. At the same  time, coil B tends to move the pointer counterclockwise.  Therefore, the moving element, composed of both coils and  the pointer, comes to rest at a position at which the two forces  are balanced. This position depends upon the value of the  external resistance, which controls the relative magnitude of  current of coil A. Because changes in voltage affect both coils  A and B in the same proportion, the position of the moving  element is independent of the voltage. If the terminals are  short circuited, the pointer rests at zero because the current  in A is relatively large. The instrument is not damaged under  these circumstances because the current is limited by R3.  

There are two types of hand-driven meggers: the variable  type and the constant pressure type. The speed of the variable  pressure megger is dependent on how fast the hand crank

is turned. The constant pressure megger uses a centrifugal  governor, or slip clutch. The governor becomes effective only  when the megger is operated at a speed above its slip speed,  at which speed its voltage remains constant.  

# AC Measuring Instruments  

A DC meter, such as an ammeter, connected in an AC circuit  indicates zero, because the meter movements used in a  d’Arsonval type movement is restricted to DC. Since the field  of a permanent magnet in the d’Arsonval type meter remains  constant and in the same direction at all times, the moving coil  follows the polarity of the current. The coil attempts to move  in one direction during half of the AC cycle and in the reverse  direction during the other half when the current reverses.  

![](images/9293590ea3820f424b581e7986dfba75b928d4ecb5e1a3f73f2fb765214e3135.jpg)

Figure 12-156.   Ohm scale.  

The current reverses direction too rapidly for the coil to  follow, causing the coil to assume an average position. Since  the current is equal and opposite during each half of the AC  cycle, the DC meter indicates zero, which is the average value.  Thus, a meter with a permanent magnet cannot be used to  measure alternating voltage and current. For AC measurements  of current and voltage, additional circuitry is required. The  additional circuitry has a rectifier, which converts AC to DC.  There are two basic types of rectifiers: the half-wave rectifier  and the full-wave rectifier.  [Figure 12-159]  

Figure 12-159  also shows a simplified block diagram of an  AC meter. In this depiction, the full-wave rectifier precedes  the meter movement. The movement responds to the average  value of the pulsating DC. The scale can then be calibrated  to show anything the designer wants. In most cases, it is the  root mean square (RMS) value or peak value.  

# Electro dynamo meter Meter Movement  

The electro dynamo meter can be used to measure alternating or  direct voltage and current. It operates on the same principles  as the permanent magnet moving coil meter, except that the  permanent magnet is replaced by an air core electromagnet.  The field of the electro dynamo meter is developed by the same  current that flows through the moving coil.  [Figure 12-160]  

Because this movement contains no iron, the  electro dynamo meter can be used as a movement for both AC  and DC instruments. AC can be measured by connecting the  stationary and moving coils in series. Whenever the current  in the moving coil reverses, the magnetic field produced  by the stationary coil reverses. Regardless of the direction  of the current, the needle moves in a clockwise direction.  However, for either voltmeter or ammeter applications,  the electro dynamo meter is too expensive to economically  compete with the d’Arsonval-type movement.  

# Moving Iron Vane Meter  

The moving iron vane meter is another basic type of meter.  It can be used to measure either AC or DC. Unlike the  d’Arsonval meter, which employs permanent magnets, it  depends on induced magnetism for its operation. It utilizes the  principle of repulsion between two concentric iron vanes, one  fixed and one movable, placed inside a solenoid. A pointer is  attached to the movable vane.  [Figure 12-161]  

When current flows through the coil, the two iron vanes  become magnetized with North poles at their upper ends and  South poles at their lower ends for one direction of current  through the coil. Because like poles repel, the unbalanced  component of force, tangent to the movable element, causes  it to turn against the force exerted by the springs.  

The movable vane is rectangular in shape and the fixed  vane is tapered. This design permits the use of a relatively  uniform scale.  

![](images/ce2214432769945892960b9a6a5c137b598c4b16a82865bb0d9eb0301547113c.jpg)  
Figure 12-157.   Multirange ohmmeter.  

When no current flows through the coil, the movable vane  is positioned so that it is opposite the larger portion of the  tapered fixed vane, and the scale reading is zero. The amount  of magnetization of the vanes depends on the strength of  the field, which, in turn, depends on the amount of current  flowing through the coil.  

The force of repulsion is greater opposite the larger end of  the fixed vane than it is nearer the smaller end. Therefore,  the movable vane moves toward the smaller end through an  angle that is proportional to the magnitude of the coil current.  The movement ceases when the force of repulsion is balanced  by the restraining force of the spring.  

Because the repulsion is always in the same direction (toward  the smaller end of the fixed vane), regardless of the direction  of current flow through the coil, the moving iron vane  instrument operates on either DC or AC circuits.  

Mechanical damping in this type of instrument can be obtained  by the use of an aluminum vane attached to the shaft so that,  as the shaft moves, the vane moves in a restricted air space.  

When the moving iron vane meter is used as an ammeter, the  coil is wound with relatively few turns of large wire in order  to carry the rated current. When the moving iron vane meter is  used as a voltmeter, the solenoid is wound with many turns of  small wire. Portable voltmeters are made with self-contained  series resistance for ranges up to 750 volts. Higher ranges are  obtained by the use of additional external multipliers.  

![](images/47cfde77b40e556893e1a77fe34cb55c63115d7363f91e0aff395928868d5b02.jpg)  
Figure 12-158.   Simplified megger circuit.  

The moving iron vane instrument may be used to measure  DC but has an error due to residual magnetism in the vanes.  Reversing the meter connections and averaging the readings  may minimize the error. When used on AC circuits, the  instrument has an accuracy of 0.5 percent. Because of its  simplicity, relatively low cost, and the fact that no current is  conducted to the moving element, this type of movement is  used extensively to measure current and voltage in AC power  circuits. However, because the reluctance of the magnetic  circuit is high, the moving iron vane meter requires much  more power to produce full-scale deflection than is required  by a d’Arsonval meter of the same range. Therefore, the  moving iron vane meter is seldom used in high-resistance  low-power circuits.  

# Inclined Coil Iron Vane Meter  

The principle of the moving iron vane mechanism is applied  to the inclined coil type of meter, which can be used to  measure both AC and DC. The inclined coil, iron vane  meter has a coil mounted at an angle to the shaft. Attached  obliquely to the shaft, and located inside the coil, are two  soft iron vanes. When no current flows through the coil, a  control spring holds the pointer at zero, and the iron vanes  lie in planes parallel to the plane of the coil. When current  flows through the coil, the vanes tend to line up with magnetic  lines passing through the center of the coil at right angles to  the plane of the coil. Thus, the vanes rotate against the spring  action to move the pointer over the scale.  

The iron vanes tend to line up with the magnetic lines  regardless of the direction of current flow through the coil.  Therefore, the inclined coil, iron vane meter can be used to  measure either AC or DC. The aluminum disk and the drag  magnets provide electromagnetic damping.  

Like the moving iron vane meter, the inclined coil type requires  a relatively large amount of current for full-scale deflection and  is seldom used in high-resistance low-power circuits.  

As in the moving iron vane instruments, the inclined coil  instrument is wound with few turns of relatively large wire  when used as an ammeter and with many turns of small wire  when used as a voltmeter.  

# Varmeters  

Multiplying the volts by the amperes in an AC circuit gives  the apparent power: the combination of the true power (which  does the work) and the reactive power (which does no work  and is returned to the line). Reactive power is measured in  units of vars (volt-amperes reactive) or kilovars (kilovolt- amperes reactive (kVAR). When properly connected,  wattmeters measure the reactive power. As such, they are  called varmeters.  [Figure 12-162]  

![](images/5066cc26d4c678c348fc857f2334ac4d8e1eabf08ab5e12d43b8985e0c28953b.jpg)  
Figure 12-159.   Simplified block diagram of AC meter.  

# Wattmeter  

Electric power is measured by means of a wattmeter. Because  electric power is the product of current and voltage, a  wattmeter must have two elements, one for current and the  other for voltage. For this reason, wattmeters are usually of  the electro dynamo meter type.  [Figure 12-163]  

The movable coil with a series resistance forms the voltage  element, and the stationary coils constitute the current  element. The strength of the field around the potential coil  depends on the amount of current that flows through it. The  current, in turn, depends on the load voltage applied across  the coil and the high resistance in series with it. The strength  of the field around the current coils depends on the amount of  current flowing through the load. Thus, the meter deflection is  proportional to the product of the voltage across the potential  coil and the current through the current coils. The effect is  

![](images/b7611e71eb351ad0cd547fefc12dfd93d7175625fa8d96f9307a04aad2b8b197.jpg)  
Figure 12-160.   Simplified diagram of an electro dynamo meter  movement.  

almost the same (if the scale is properly calibrated) as if the  voltage applied across the load and the current through the  load were multiplied together.  

If the current in the line is reversed, the direction of current in  both coils and the potential coil is reversed, the net result is  that the pointer continues to read up scale. Therefore, this type  of wattmeter can be used to measure either AC or DC power.  

# Frequency Measurement/Oscilloscope  

The oscilloscope is by far one of the more useful electronic  measurements available. The viewing capabilities of the  oscilloscope make it possible to see and quantify various  waveform characteristics, such as phase relationships,  amplitudes, and durations. While oscilloscopes come in  a variety of configurations and presentations, the basic  operation is typically the same. Most oscilloscopes in general  bench or shop applications use a cathode-ray tube (CRT),  which is the device or screen that displays the waveforms.  

The CRT is a vacuum instrument that contains an electron gun,  which emits a very narrow and focused beam of electrons. A  phosphorescent coat applied to the back of the screen forms  the screen. The beam is electronically aimed and accelerated  so that the electron beam strikes the screen. When the electron  beam strikes the screen, light is emitted at the point of impact.  

Figure 12-164  shows the basic components of the CRT  with a block diagram. The heated cathode emits electrons.  The magnitude of voltage on the control grid determines  the actual flow of electrons and thus controls the intensity  of the electron beam. The acceleration anodes increase the  speed of the electrons, and the focusing anode narrows the  beam down to a fine point. The surface of the screen is also  an anode and assists in the acceleration of the electron beam.

Figure 12-162.   A varmeter connected in an AC circuit.  

The purpose of the vertical and horizontal deflection plates  is to bend the electron beam and position it to a specific  point of the screen.  [Figure 12-165]  By providing a neutral  or zero voltage to a deflection plate, the electron beam is  unaffected. By applying a negative voltage to a plate, the  electron beam is repelled and driven away from the plate.  Finally, by applying a positive voltage, the electron beam is  drawing to the plate.  Figure 12-165  provides a few possible  plate voltage combinations and the resultant beam position.  

# Horizontal Deflection  

To get a visual representation of the input signal, an internally  generated saw-tooth voltage is generated and then applied  to the horizontal deflection plates.  Figure 12-166  illustrates  that the saw-tooth is a pattern of voltage applied, which  begins at a negative voltage and increases at a constant rate  to a positive voltage. This applied varying voltage draws or  traces the electron beam from the far left of the screen to the  far right side of the screen. The resulting display is a straight  line, if the sweep rate is fast enough. This saw-tooth applied  voltage is a repetitive signal so that the beam is repeatedly  swept across the tube. The rate at which the saw-tooth voltage  goes from negative to positive is determined by the frequency.  This rate then establishes the sweep rate of the beam. When  the saw-tooth reaches the end of its sweep from left to right,  the beam then rapidly returns to the left side and is ready to  make another sweep. During this time, the electron beam is  stopped or blanked out and does not produce any kind of a  trace. This period of time is called flyback.  

# Vertical Deflection  

If this same signal were applied to the vertical plates, it would  also produce a vertical line by causing the beam to trace from  the down position to the up position.  

# Tracing a Sine Wave  

Reproducing the sine wave on the oscilloscope combines  both the vertical and horizontal deflection patterns.  [Figure 12-167]  If the sine wave voltage signal is applied  across the vertical deflection plates, the result will be the  vertical beam oscillation up and down on the screen. The  amount that the beam moves above the centerline depends  While the beam is being swept from the left to the right by  the horizontal plates, the sine wave voltage is being applied  to the vertical plates, causing the form of the input signal to  be traced out on the screen.  

# Control Features on an Oscilloscope  

While there are many different styles of oscilloscopes, which  range from the simple to the complex, they all have some  controls in common. Apart from the screen and the ON/OFF  switch, some of these controls are listed as follows:  

•	 Horizontal Position—allows for the adjustment of the  neutral horizontal position of the beam. Use this control  to reposition the waveform display in order to have a  better view of the wave or to take measurements. • 	 Vertical Position—moves the traced image up or down  allowing better observations and measurements. • 	 Focus—controls the electron beam as it is aimed and  converges on the screen. When the beam is in sharp  focus, it is narrowed down to a very fine point and  does not have a fuzzy appearance. • 	 Intensity—essentially the brightness of the trace.  Controlling the flow of electrons onto the screen varies  the intensity. Do not keep the intensity too high for  extended testing or when the beam is motionless and  forms a dot on the screen. This can damage the screen. • 	 Seconds/Division—a time-based control that sets the  horizontal sweep rate. Basically, the switch is used  to select the time interval that each division on the  horizontal scale represents. These divisions can be  seconds, milliseconds, or even microseconds. A simple  example would be if the technician had the seconds/ division control set to   $10~\upmu\mathrm{S}$  . If this technician is  viewing a waveform that has a period of 4 divisions  on the screen, then the period would be   $40~\upmu\mathrm{S}$  . The  frequency of this waveform can then be determined  by taking the inverse of the period. In this case,  $\%\,\upmu\mathrm{S}$    equals a frequency of  $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$  . •	 Volts/Division—used to select the voltage interval  that each division on the vertical scale represents.  For example, suppose each vertical division was set  to equal   $10\ \mathrm{mV.}$   If a waveform was measured and  had a peak value of 4 divisions, then the peak value  in voltage would be  $40\:\mathrm{mV}.$  •	 Trigger—The trigger control provides synchronization  between the saw-tooth horizontal sweep and the applied  signal on the vertical plates. The benefit is that the  waveform on the screen appears to be stationary and  fixed and not drifting across the screen. A triggering  circuit is used to initiate the start of a sweep rather than

the fixed saw-tooth sweep rate. In a typical oscilloscope,  this triggering signal comes from the input signal  itself at a selected point during the signal’s cycle. The  horizontal signal goes through one sweep, retraces back  to the left side and waits there until it is triggered again  by the input signal to start another sweep.  

# Flat Panel Color Displays for Oscilloscopes  

While the standard CRT design of oscilloscope is still in  service, the technology of display and control has evolved  into use of the flat panel monitors. Furthermore, the newer  oscilloscopes can even be integrated with the common  personal computer (PC).  [Figure 12-168]  Some of the features  of this technology include easy data capture, data transfer,  documentation, and data analysis. Hand-held oscilloscopes are  now available that can perform the functions of larger bench  type equipment but are mobile and great tools for trouble  shooting.  [Figure 12-169]  

# Digital Multimeter  

Traditionally, the meters that technicians have used have been  the analog voltmeter, ammeter, and the ohmmeter. These  have usually been combined into the same instrument and  called a multimeter or a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter). This  approach has been both convenient and economical. Digital  multimeters (DMM) and digital voltmeters (DVM) are more  common due to their ease of use. These meters are easier to  read and provide greater accuracy when compared to the  older analog units with needle movement. The multimeter’s  single-coil movement requires a number of scales, which are  not always easy to read accurately. In addition, the loading  characteristics due to the internal resistance sometimes  affect the circuit and the measurements. Not only does the  DVM offer greater accuracy and less ambiguity, but also  higher input resistance, which has less of a loading effect  and influence on a circuit.  

# Basic Circuit Analysis & Troubleshooting  

Troubleshooting is the systematic process of recognizing  the symptoms of a problem, identifying the possible cause,  and locating the failed component or conductor in the  circuit. To be proficient at troubleshooting, the technician  must understand how the circuit operates and know how to  properly use the test equipment. There are many ways in  which a system can fail and to cover all of the possibilities is  beyond the scope of this handbook. However, there are some  basic concepts that enable the technician to handle many of  the common faults encountered in the aircraft.  

Before starting a discussion on basic circuits and  troubleshooting, the following definitions are given.  

•	 Short circuit—an unintentional low resistance path  between two components in a circuit or between a

component/conductor and ground. It usually creates  high current flow, which burns out or causes damage  to the circuit conductor or components.  

•	 Open circuit—a circuit that is not a complete or  continuous path. An open circuit represents an  infinitely large resistance. Switches are common  devices used to open and close a circuit. Sometimes  a circuit opens due to a component failure, such as a  light bulb or a burned out resistor. •	 Continuity—the state of being continuous,  uninterrupted or connected together; the opposite of  a circuit that is not broken or does not have an open. •	 Discontinuity—the opposite of continuity, indicating  that a circuit is broken or not continuous.  

# Voltage Measurement  

Voltage is measured across a component with a voltmeter or  the voltmeter position on a multimeter. Usually, there is a DC  and an AC selection on the meter. Before the meter is used  for measurements, make sure that the meter is selected for  the correct type of voltage. When placing the probes across a  component to take a measurement, take care to ensure that the  polarity is correct.  [Figure 12-170]  Standard practice is for  the red meter lead to be installed in the positive  $(+)$   jack and  the black meter lead to be installed in the negative meter jack   $(-)$  . Then when placing the probes across or in parallel with  a component to measure the voltage, the leads should match  the polarity of the component. The red lead is on the positive  

![](images/7f591c87dd8d774ae7d299d760aa3f8d2cfccb6e917b39f07dc5db7dbd4826d4.jpg)

side of the component and the black is on the negative side,  which prevents damage to the meter or incorrect readings.  

All meters have some resistance and will shunt some of the  current. This has the effect of changing the characteristic of  the circuit because of this change in current. This is typically  more of a concern with older analog type meters. If there  are any questions about the magnitude of the voltage across  a component, then the meter should be set to measure on  the highest voltage range. This prevents the meter from  “pegging” and possible damage. The range should then be  selected to low values until the measured voltage is read at  the mid-scale deflection. Readings taken at mid-scale are  the most accurate.  

# Current Measurement  

Current is measured with the ammeter connected in the  current path by opening or breaking the circuit and inserting  the meter in series.  [Figure 12-170]  Standard practice is for  the red meter lead to be installed in the positive  $(+)$   jack and  the black meter lead to be installed in the negative meter jack   $(-)$  . The positive side of the meter is connected towards the  positive voltage source. Ideally, the meter should not alter  the current and influence the circuit and the measurements.  However, the meter does have some effect because of its  internal resistance that is connected with the rest of the circuit  in series. The resistance is rather small and for most practical  purposes, this can be neglected.  

# Checking Resistance in a Circuit  

The ohmmeter is used to measure the resistance. In its more  basic form, the ohmmeter consists of a variable resistor in  series with a meter movement and a voltage source. The  meter must first be adjusted before use.  

Refer to  Figure 12-171  for meter configurations during  adjustments. When the meter leads are not connected (open),  the needle points to the full left-hand position, indicating  infinite resistance or and open circuit. With the lead placed  together, the circuit is shorted as shown with the meter  needle to the full right-hand position. When a connection  is made, the internal battery is allowed to produce a current  through the movement coil, causing a deflection of the  needle in proportion to the value of the external resistance.  In this case, the resistance is zero because the leads are  shorted.  

The purpose of the variable resistor in the meter is to adjust  the current so that the pointer reads exactly zero when the  leads are shorted. This is needed because as the battery  continues to be used, the voltage changes, thus requiring an  adjustment. The meter should be “zeroed” before each use.  

To check the value of a resistor, the resistor must be  disconnected from the circuit. This prevents any possible  damage to the ohmmeter, and it prevents the possibility of  any inaccurate readings due to the circuit being in parallel  with the resistor in question.  [Figure 12-172]  

# Continuity Checks  

In many cases, the ohmmeter is not used for measuring the  resistance of a component but to simply check the integrity  of a connection from one portion of a circuit to another. If  there is a good connection, then the ohmmeter reads a near  zero resistance or a short. If the circuit is open or has a very  poor connection at some point like an over-crimped pin in  a connector, then the ohmmeter reads infinity or some very  high resistance. Keep in mind that while any measurement  is being taken, contact with the circuit or probes should be  avoided. Contact can introduce another parallel path and  provide misleading indications.  

# Capacitance Measurement  

Figure 12-173  illustrates a basic test of a capacitor with an  ohmmeter. There are usually two common modes of failure  for a capacitor. One is a complete failure characterized  by short circuit through the capacitor due to the dielectric  breaking down or an open circuit. The more insidious failure  occurs due to degradation, which is a gradual deterioration  of the capacitor’s characteristics.  

If a problem is suspected, remove the capacitor from the circuit  and check with an ohmmeter. The first step is to short the two  leads of the capacitor to ensure that it is entirely discharged.  Next, connect the two leads as shown in  Figure 12-173  across  the capacitor and observe the needle movement. At first, the  needle should indicate a short circuit. Then as the capacitor  begins to charge, the needle should move to the left or infinity  and eventually indicate an open circuit. The capacitor takes  its charge from the internal battery of the ohmmeter. The  greater the capacitance, the longer it takes to charge. If the  capacitor is shorted, then the needle remains at a very low or  shorted resistance. If there is some internal deterioration of the  dielectric, then the needle never reaches a high resistance but  some intermediate value, indicating a current.

# Inductance Measurement  

The common mode of failure in an inductor is an open. To  check the integrity of an inductor, it must be removed from  the circuit and tested as an isolated component just like the  capacitor. If there is an open in the inductor, a simple check  with an ohmmeter shows it as an open circuit with infinite  resistance. If in fact the inductor is in good condition, then  the ohmmeter indicates the resistance of the coil.  

On occasions, the inductor fails due to overheating. When  the inductor is overheated, it is possible for the insulation  covering the wire in the coil to melt, causing a short. The  effects of a shorted coil are that of reducing the number of  turns. At this point, further testing of the inductor must be  

# Tracing Opens with the Voltmeter  

# Troubleshooting Open Faults in a Series Circuit  

One of the most common modes of failure is the “open”  circuit. A component, such as a resistor, can overheat due  to the power rating being exceeded. Other more frustrating  problems can happen when a “cold” solder joint cracks  leaving a wire disconnected from a relay or connector.  This type of damage can occur during routine maintenance  after a technician has accessed an area for inspections.  In many cases, there is no visual indication that a failure  has occurred, and the soon-to-be-frustrated technician is  unaware that there is a problem until power is reapplied to  the aircraft in the final days leading up to aircraft delivery  and scheduled operations.  

The first example is a simplified diagram shown in  Figures 12-174  through  12-176 . The circuit depicted in  Figure 12-174  is designed to cause current to flow through a  lamp, but because of the open resistor, the lamp will not light.  To locate this open, a voltmeter or an ohmmeter should be used.  

![](images/3d50d8db16c9bf39409fa94a66fe0554f3d3c1f1cbbc85e9faf1e7352479fa0e.jpg)  
Figure 12-170.   Current, voltage, and resistance measurement.  

A general procedure to follow in this case is to measure the  voltage drop across each component in the circuit, keeping  in mind the following points. If there is an open in a series  circuit, then the voltage drops on sides of the component.  In this case, the total voltage must appear across the open  resistor as per Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law.  

If a voltmeter is connected across the lamp, as shown in  Figure 12-175 , the voltmeter reads zero. Since no current can  flow in the circuit because of the open resistor, there is no  voltage drop across the lamp indicating that the lamp is good.  

Next, the voltmeter is connected across the open resistor, as  shown in  Figure 12-176 . The voltmeter has closed the circuit  by shunting (paralleling) the burned out resistor, allowing  current to flow. Current flows from the negative terminal of  the battery, through the switch, through the voltmeter and the  lamp, back to the positive terminal of the battery. However,  the resistance of the voltmeter is so high that only a very  small current flows in the circuit. The current is too small to  light the lamp, but the voltmeter reads the battery voltage.  

# Tracing Opens with the Ohmmeter  

A simplified circuit, as shown in  Figures 12-177  and  12-178, illustrates how to locate an open in a series circuit using the  ohmmeter. A general rule to keep in mind when troubleshooting  with an ohmmeter is: when an ohmmeter is properly connected  across a circuit component and a resistance reading is obtained,  the component has continuity and is not open.  

When an ohmmeter is used, the circuit component to be tested  must be isolated and the power source removed from the  circuit. In this case, these requirements can be met by opening  the circuit switch as shown in  Figure 12-177 . The ohmmeter  is zeroed and across all good components is zero. The voltage  drop across the open component equals the total voltage across  the series combination. This condition happens because the  open component prevents current to pass through the series  circuit. With there being no current, there can be no voltage  drop across any of the good components. Because the current is  zero, it can be determined by Ohm’s Law that  $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}\,{=}\,\boldsymbol{\mathrm{IR}}\,{=}\,0$   volts  across a component. The voltage is the same on both places  across (in parallel with) the lamp. In this testing configuration,  some value of resistance is read indicating that the lamp is in  good condition and is not the source of the open in the circuit.  

Now the technician should move to the resistor and place  the ohmmeter probe across it as shown in  Figure 12-178 When the ohmmeter is connected across the open resistor,  it indicates infinite resistance, or a discontinuity. Thus, the  circuit open has now been located.  

![](images/55d494933e9bf3426316ed9ebc605553d3f3fcb02a72b892f98ec9757361ef40.jpg)

# Troubleshooting Shorting Faults in a Series Circuit  

An open fault can cause a component or system not to  work, which can be critical and hazardous. A shorting  fault can potentially be more of a severe nature than the  open type of fault. A short circuit, or “short,” causes the  opposite effect. A short across a series circuit produces a  greater than normal current flow. Faults of this type can  develop slowly when a wire bundle is not properly secured  and is allowed to chafe against the airframe structure or  other systems, such as hydraulic lines. Shorts can also  occur due to a careless technician using incorrect hardware  when installing an interior. If screws that are too long are  used to install trim, it is possible to penetrate a wire bundle  immediately causing numerous shorts. Worse yet, are the  

![](images/98302061455e06d6321fac980ad5281124bfd996323a6c1591ad151f513f7d82.jpg)  
Figure 12-172.   Meter adjustment.  

shorts that are not immediately seen but “latent” and do not  show symptoms until the aircraft is in service. Another point  to keep in mind is when closing panels. Wires can become  pinched between the panel and the airframe causing either  a short or a latent, intermittent short. The simplified circuit,  shown in  Figures 12-179  through  12-182  is used to illustrate  troubleshooting a short in a series circuit.  

In  Figure 12-179 , a circuit is designed to light a lamp. A  resistor is connected in the circuit to limit current flow. If the  resistor is shorted, as shown in the illustration, the current  flow increases and the lamp becomes brighter. If the applied  voltage were high enough, the lamp would burn out, but in  this case the fuse would protect the lamp by opening first. Usually a short circuit produces an open circuit by either  blowing (opening) the fuse or burning out a circuit  component. But in some circuits, there may be additional  resistors which do not allow one shorted resistor to increase  the current flow enough to blow the fuse or burn out a  component.  [Figure 12-180]  Thus, with one resistor shorted  out, the circuit still functions since the power dissipated by  the other resistors does not exceed the rating of the fuse.  

# Tracing Shorts with the Ohmmeter  

The shorted resistor can be located with an ohmmeter.  [Figure 12-181]  First the switch is opened to isolate the  

![](images/ae41e388e5a6985d7d2559fdc056a2ebc4796454e9fb9c4fa73820999404761e.jpg)  

circuit components. In  Figure 12-181 , this circuit is shown  with an ohmmeter connected across each of the resistors.  Only the ohmmeter connected across the shorted resistor  shows a zero reading, indicating that this resistor is shorted.  

# Tracing Shorts with the Voltmeter  

To locate the shorted resistor while the circuit is functioning,  a voltmeter can be used.  Figure 12-182  illustrates that when  a voltmeter is connected across any of the resistors that are  not shorted, a portion of the applied voltage is indicated on  the voltmeter scale. When it is connected across the shorted  resistor, the voltmeter reads zero.  

# Troubleshooting Open Faults in a Parallel Circuit  

The procedures used in troubleshooting a parallel circuit are  sometimes different from those used in a series circuit. Unlike a  series circuit, a parallel circuit has more than one path in which  current flows. A voltmeter cannot be used, since, when it is placed  across an open resistor, it reads the voltage drop in a parallel  branch. But an ammeter or the modified use of an ohmmeter  can be employed to detect an open branch in a parallel circuit.  

If the open resistor shown in  Figure 12-183  was not visually  apparent, the circuit might appear to be functioning properly,  because current would continue to flow in the other two  branches of the circuit. To determine that the circuit is not  operating properly, a determination must be made as to how the  circuit should behave when working properly. First, the total  resistance, total current, and the branch currents of the circuit  should be calculated as if there were no open in the circuit.  In this case, the total resistance can be simply determined by:  

${\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}={\frac{\mathrm{R}}{\mathrm{N}}}$  Where 	   ${\mathbf{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}$   is the total circuit resistance 	  $_\mathrm{N}$   is the number of resistors 	  $\mathrm{R}$   is the resistor value  

![](images/5ebde884dc283cd5d916f19629f932d9abe0ca7c0e98569f08d5b3f5ef650353.jpg)

Figure 12-176.   Voltmeter across a resistor in an open circuit.  

$$
{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}={\frac{\,30\;\Omega}{3}}=10\;\Omega
$$  

The total current of the circuit can now be determined by using Ohm’s Law:  

$$
{\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{T}}=\ {\frac{{\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{S}}}{{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}}}
$$  

Where 	   $\mathrm{I_{T}}$   is the total current 	  $\mathrm{{E}_{S}}$   is the source voltage across the 	 parallel branch 	  ${\mathbf{R}}_{\mathrm{T}}$   is the total resistance of the 	 parallel branch 	  $\mathrm{I_{T}}=\mathrm{\frac{30\;\mathrm{v}}{10\;\Omega}}=3\;\mathrm{ampere{\;}}(\mathrm{total\;current})$  

Each branch current should be determined in a similar manner. For the first branch, the current is:  

$$
\mathrm{I}_{1}=\ \frac{\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{S}}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{I}_{1}=\mathrm{\small~\displaystyle\frac{30\;\mathrm{v}}{30\;\Omega}=1~a m p e r e}
$$  

Because the other two branches are of the same resistive  value, then the current in each of those branches is 1 ampere  also. Adding up the amperes in each branch confirms the  

![](images/fd554126e2d2216f17af77fce83381298f09cea84af4090d1bf883b38485e2c8.jpg)

initial calculation of total current being 3 amperes.  

# Tracing an Open with an Ammeter  

If the technician now places an ammeter in the circuit, the  total current would be indicated as 2 amperes as shown in  Figure 12-183  instead of the calculated 3 amperes. Since 1  ampere of current should be flowing through each branch,  it is obvious that one branch is open. If the ammeter is then  connected into the branches, one after another, the open  branch is eventually located by a zero ammeter reading.  

# Tracing an Open with an Ohmmeter  

A modified use of the ohmmeter can also locate this type  of open. If the ohmmeter is connected across the open  resistor, as shown in  Figure 12-184 , an erroneous reading  of continuity would be obtained. Even though the circuit  switch is open, the open resistor is still in parallel with  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  and  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  , and the ohmmeter would indicate the open resistor  had a resistance of 15 ohms, the equivalent resistance of  the parallel combination of   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  .  

Therefore, it is necessary to open the circuit as shown in  Figure 12-185  in order to check the resistance of  $\mathrm{R}_{3}$  . In this  way, the resistor is not shunted (paralleled) by  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   and  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$  . The  reading on the ohmmeter now indicates infinite resistance,  which means the open component has been isolated.  

# Troubleshooting Shorting Faults in Parallel Circuits  

As in a series circuit, a short in a parallel circuit usually  causes an open circuit by blowing the fuse. But, unlike a  series circuit, one shorted component in a parallel circuit  stops current flow by causing the fuse to open. Refer to the  circuit in  Figure 12-186 . If resistor   $\mathrm{R}_{3}$   is shorted, a path of  almost zero resistance is offered the current, and all the circuit  current flows through the branch containing the shorted  resistor. Since this is practically the same as connecting a  wire between the terminals of the battery, the current rises to  an excessive value, and the fuse opens. Since the fuse opens  almost as soon as a resistor shorts out, there is no time to  perform a current or voltage check. Thus, troubleshooting  a parallel DC circuit for a shorted component should be  accomplished with an ohmmeter. But, as in the case of  checking for an open resistor in a parallel circuit, a shorted  resistor can be detected with an ohmmeter only if one end  of the shorted resistor is disconnected and isolated from the  rest of the circuit.

locating malfunctions similar to those found in a series or  a parallel circuit.  Figures 12-187  through  12-189  illustrate  three points of failure in a series-parallel circuit and their  generalized effects.  

1.	 In the circuit shown in  Figure 12-187 , an open has  occurred in the series portion of the circuit. When  the open occurs anywhere in the series portion of a  series-parallel circuit, current flow in the entire circuit  stops. In this case, the circuit does not function, and  the lamp,  $\mathrm{L}_{1}$  , is not lit. 2.	 If the open occurs in the parallel portion of a series- parallel circuit, as shown in  Figure 12-188 , part of the  circuit continues to function. In this case, the lamp  continues to burn, but its brightness diminishes, since  the total resistance of the circuit has increased and the  total current has decreased. 3.	 If the open occurs in the branch containing the lamp,  as shown in  Figure 12-189 , the circuit continues to  function with increased resistance and decreased  current, but the lamp does not light.  

# Tracing Opens with the Voltmeter  

To explain how the voltmeter and ohmmeter can be used  to troubleshoot series-parallel circuits, the circuit shown in  Figure 12-190  has been labeled at various points. A point- to-point description is listed below with expected results:  

1.	 By connecting a voltmeter between points A and D,  the battery and switch can be checked for opens. 2.	 By connecting the voltmeter between points A and  B, the voltage drop across   $\mathrm{R}_{1}$   can be checked. This  voltage drop is a portion of the applied voltage. 3.	 If   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   is open, the reading between B and D is zero. 4.	 By connecting a voltmeter between A and E, the  continuity of the conductor between the positive  terminal of the battery and point E, as well as the fuse,

Figure 12-183.   Finding an open branch in a parallel circuit.  

can be checked. If the conductor or fuse is open, the  voltmeter reads zero.  

5.	 If the lamp is burning, it is obvious that no open  exists in the branch containing the lamp, and the  voltmeter could be used to detect an open in the branch  containing  $\mathrm{R}_{2}$   by removing lamp,  $\mathrm{L}_{1}$  , from the circuit.  

Troubleshooting the series portion of a series-parallel circuit  presents no difficulties, but in the parallel portion of the  circuit, misleading readings can be obtained.  

# Batteries  

# Primary Cell  

The dry cell is the most common type of primary-cell battery  and is similar in its characteristics to that of an electrolytic  cell. This type of a battery is basically designed with a metal  electrode or graphite rod acting as the cathode  $(+)$   terminal,  immersed in an electrolytic paste. This electrode⁄electrolytic  build-up is then encased in a metal container, usually made  of zinc, which itself acts as the anode  $(-)$   terminal. When the  battery is in a discharge condition an electrochemical reaction  takes place resulting in one of the metals being consumed.  Because of this consumption, the charging process is not  reversible. Attempting to reverse the chemical reaction in a  primary cell by way of recharging is usually dangerous and  can lead to a battery explosion.  

These batteries are commonly used to power items such as  flashlights. The most common primary cells today are found  in alkaline batteries, silver-oxide, and lithium batteries. The  earlier carbon-zinc cells, with a carbon post as cathode and a  zinc shell as anode were once prevalent but are not as common.  

# Secondary Cell  

A secondary cell is any kind of electrolytic cell in which the  electrochemical reaction that releases energy is reversible.  The lead-acid car battery is a secondary-cell battery. The  electrolyte is sulfuric acid (battery acid), the positive  electrode is lead peroxide, and the negative electrode is  lead. A typical lead-acid battery consists of six lead-acid  cells in a case. Each cell produces 2 volts, so the whole  battery produces a total of 12 volts.  

Other commonly used secondary cell chemistry types are  nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cad), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH),  lithium-ion (Li-ion), and Lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion  polymer).  

Lead-acid batteries used in aircraft are similar to automobile  batteries. The lead acid battery is made up of a series of  identical cells each containing sets of positive and negative  plates.  Figure 12-191  illustrates each cell contains positive  plates of lead dioxide   $\left(\mathrm{PbO}_{2}\right)$  , negative plates of spongy lead,  and electrolyte (sulfuric acid and water). A practical cell is  constructed with many more plates than just two in order to get  the required current output. All positive plates are connected  together as well as all the negatives. Because each positive  plate is always positioned between two negative plates, there  are always one or more negative plates than positive plates.  

Between the plates are porous separators that keep the  positive and negative plates from touching each other and  shorting out the cell. The separators have vertical ribs on  the side facing the positive plate. This construction permits  the electrolyte to circulate freely around the plates. In  addition, it provides a path for sediment to settle to the  bottom of the cell.  

Each cell is seated in a hard rubber casing through the top  of which are terminal posts and a hole into which a nonspill  vent cap is screwed. The hole provides access for testing the  strength of the electrolyte and adding water. The vent plug  permits gases to escape from the cell with a minimum of  leakage of electrolyte, regardless of the position the airplane  might assume.  [Figure 12-192]  In level flight, the lead weight

permits venting of gases through a small hole. In inverted  flight, this hole is covered by the lead weight.  

The individual cells of the battery are connected in series by  means of cell straps.  [Figure 12-193]  The complete assembly  is enclosed in an acid resisting metal container (battery box),  which serves as electrical shielding and mechanical protection.  The battery box has a removable top. It also has a vent tube  nipple at each end. When the battery is installed in an airplane, a  vent tube is attached to each nipple. One tube is the intake tube  and is exposed to the slipstream. The other is the exhaust vent  tube and is attached to the battery drain sump, which is a glass  jar containing a felt pad moistened with a concentrated solution  of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). With this arrangement,  the airstream is directed through the battery case where battery  gases are picked up, neutralized in the sump, and then expelled  overboard without damage to the airplane.  

To facilitate installation and removal of the battery in some  aircraft, a quick disconnect assembly is used to connect the  power leads to the battery. This assembly attaches the battery  leads in the aircraft to a receptacle mounted on the side of the  battery.  [Figure 12-194]  The receptacle covers the battery  terminal posts and prevents accidental shorting during the  

![](images/7d8014c7e2e15c78cf8d853de742eae1e111c4152a49acec19144cee16782de6.jpg)

installation and removal of the battery. The plug consists of  a socket and a handwheel with a course pitch thread. It can  be readily connected to the receptacle by the handwheel.  Another advantage of this assembly is that the plug can be  installed in only one position, eliminating the possibility of  reversing the battery leads.  

The voltage of lead acid cell is approximately two volts in order  to attain the voltage required for the application. Each cell is  then connected in series with heavy gauge metal straps to form  a battery. In a typical battery, such as that used in an aircraft for  starting, the voltage required is 12 or 24 volts. This voltage is  achieved by connecting six cells or twelve cells respectively  together in series and enclosing them in one plastic box.  

Each cell containing the plates are filled with an electrolyte  composed of sulfuric acid and distilled water with a specific  gravity of 1.270 at   $60\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . This solution contains positive  hydrogen ions and negative sulfate  $\mathrm{(SO_{4})}$   ions that are free to  combine with other ions and form a new chemical compound.  When the cell is discharged, electrons leave the negative  plate and flow to the positive plates where they cause the  lead dioxide   $\mathrm{(PbO_{2})}$   to break down into negative oxygen  ions and positive lead ions. The negative oxygen ions join  with positive hydrogen ions from the sulfuric acid and form  water   $\mathrm{(H}_{2}\mathrm{O)}$  . The negative sulfate ions join with the lead  ions in both plates and form lead sulfate   $\mathrm{(PbSO_{4})}$  ). After the  discharge, the specific gravity changes to about 1.150.  

# Battery Ratings  

The voltage of a battery is determined by the number of  cells connected in series to form the battery. Although the  voltage of one lead-acid cell just removed from a charger is  approximately 2.2 volts, a lead-acid cell is normally rated at  approximately 2 volts. A battery rated at 12 volts consists of  6 lead-acid cells connected in series, and a battery rated at  24 volts is composed of 12 cells.  

The most common battery rating is the ampere-hour rating.  This is a unit of measurement for battery capacity. It is  determined by multiplying a current flow in amperes by the  time in hours that the battery is being discharged.  

A battery with a capacity of 1 ampere-hour should be able  to continuously supply a current of 1 amp to a load for  exactly 1 hour, or 2 amps for  $\%$   hour, or   $\%$   amp for 3 hours,  etc., before becoming completely discharged. Actually, the  ampere-hour output of a particular battery depends on the  rate at which it is discharged. Heavy discharge current heats  the battery and decreases its efficiency and total ampere-hour  output. For airplane batteries, a period of 5 hours has been  established as the discharge time in rating battery capacity.  However, this time of 5 hours is only a basis for rating and  does not necessarily mean the length of time during which  

![](images/57634cf2183603904fb39df2ceec2172de15e60b39e76d89caec949d9c44b034.jpg)  
Figure 12-190.   Using the voltmeter to troubleshoot a series-parallel  circuit.  

the battery is expected to furnish current. Under actual service  conditions, the battery can be completely discharged within  a few minutes, or it may never be discharged if the generator  provides sufficient charge.  

The ampere-hour capacity of a battery depends upon its total  effective plate area. Connecting batteries in parallel increases  ampere-hour capacity. Connecting batteries in series increases  the total voltage but not the ampere-hour capacity.  

# Life Cycle of a Battery  

Battery life cycle is defined as the number of complete charge/ discharge cycles a battery can perform before its normal charge  capacity falls below 80 percent of its initial rated capacity.  Battery life can vary anywhere from 500 to 1,300 cycles.  Various factors can cause deterioration of a battery and shorten  its service life. The first is over-discharging, which causes  excess sulfation; second, too-rapid charging or discharging  that results in overheating of the plates and shedding of active  material. The accumulation of shed material, in turn, causes  shorting of the plates and results in internal discharge. A battery  that remains in a low or discharged condition for a long period  of time may be permanently damaged. The deterioration can  continue to a point where cell capacity can drop to 80 percent  after 1,000 cycles. In many cases, the cell can continue working  to nearly 2,000 cycles but with a diminished capacity of 60  percent of its original state.

# Lead-Acid Battery Testing Methods  

The state of charge of a storage battery depends upon  the condition of its active materials, primarily the plates.  However, the state of charge of a battery is indicated by the  density of the electrolyte and is checked by a hydrometer,  an instrument that measures the specific gravity (weight as  compared with water) of liquids.  

The most commonly used hydrometer consists of a small  sealed glass tube weighted at its lower end so it floats upright.  [Figure 12-195]  Within the narrow stem of the tube is a paper  scale with a range of 1.100 to 1.300. When a hydrometer  is used, a quantity of electrolyte sufficient to float the  hydrometer is drawn up into the syringe. The depth to which  the hydrometer sinks into the electrolyte is determined by the  density of the electrolyte, and the scale value indicated at the  level of the electrolyte is its specific gravity. The more dense  the electrolyte, the higher the hydrometer floats; therefore,  the highest number on the scale (1.300) is at the lower end  of the hydrometer scale.  

In a new, fully-charged aircraft storage battery, the electrolyte  is approximately 30 percent acid and 70 percent water (by  volume) and is 1.300 times as heavy as pure water. During  discharge, the solution (electrolyte) becomes less dense and  its specific gravity drops below 1.300. A specific gravity  reading between 1.300 and 1.275 indicates a high state of  charge; between 1.275 and 1.240, a medium state of charge;  and between 1.240 and 1.200, a low state of charge. Aircraft  batteries are generally of small capacity but are subject to  heavy loads. The values specified for state of charge are  therefore rather high. Hydrometer tests are made periodically  on all storage batteries installed in aircraft. An aircraft battery  in a low state of charge may have perhaps 50 percent charge  remaining, but is nevertheless considered low in the face of  heavy demands that would soon exhaust it. A battery in such a

Figure 12-193.   Connection of storage battery.  

state of charge is considered in need of immediate recharging.  

When a battery is tested using a hydrometer, the temperature  of the electrolyte must be taken into consideration. The  specific gravity readings on the hydrometer vary from  the actual specific gravity as the temperature changes. No  correction is necessary when the temperature is between   $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and   $90\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , since the variation is not great enough to  consider. When temperatures are greater than   $90~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or less  than  $70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , it is necessary to apply a correction factor. Some  hydrometers are equipped with a correction scale inside the  tube. With other hydrometers, it is necessary to refer to a chart  provided by the manufacturer. In both cases, the corrections  should be added to, or subtracted from the reading shown  on the hydrometer.  

The specific gravity of a cell is reliable only if nothing has  

![](images/b2efad1dc6b5f688fb23e081295bdb50c53528ea2b5192439f15378f801ad5bc.jpg)  
Figure 12-194.   A battery quick-disconnect assembly.  

been added to the electrolyte except occasional small amounts  of distilled water to replace that lost as a result of normal  evaporation. Always take hydrometer readings before adding  distilled water, never after. This is necessary to allow time  for the water to mix thoroughly with the electrolyte and to  avoid drawing up into the hydrometer syringe a sample that  does not represent the true strength of the solution.  

Exercise extreme care when making the hydrometer test of  a lead-acid cell. Handle the electrolyte carefully because  sulfuric acid burns clothing and skin. If the acid does contact  the skin, wash the area thoroughly with water and then apply  bicarbonate of soda.  

# Lead-Acid Battery Charging Methods  

Passing direct current through the battery in a direction  opposite to that of the discharge current may charge a  storage battery. Because of the internal resistance (IR) in the  battery, the voltage of the external charging source must be  greater than the open circuit voltage. For example, the open  circuit voltage of a fully charged 12 cell, lead-acid battery is  approximately 26.4 volts (  $12\times2.2$   volts), but approximately  28 volts are required to charge it. This larger voltage is needed  for charging because of the voltage drop in the battery caused  by the internal resistance. Hence, the charging voltage of a  lead-acid battery must equal the open circuit voltage plus the  IR drop within the battery (product of the charging current  and the internal resistance).  

Batteries are charged by either the constant voltage or  constant current method. In the constant voltage method  [Figure 12-196A] , a motor generator set with a constant,  regulated voltage forces the current through the battery. In  this method, the current at the start of the process is high but  automatically tapers off, reaching a value of approximately  1 ampere when the battery is fully charged. The constant  voltage method requires less time and supervision than does  the constant current method.  

In the constant current method  [Figure 12-196B] , the current  remains almost constant during the entire charging process.  This method requires a longer time to charge a battery fully  and, toward the end of the process, presents the danger of  overcharging, if care is not exercised.  

In the aircraft, the storage battery is charged by direct current  from the aircraft generator system. This method of charging  is the constant voltage method, since the generator voltage  is held constant by use of a voltage regulator.  

When a storage battery is being charged, it generates a  certain amount of hydrogen and oxygen. Since this is an  explosive mixture, it is important to take steps to prevent  ignition of the gas mixture. Loosen the vent caps and  leave in place. Do not permit open flames, sparks, or other  sources of ignition in the vicinity. Before disconnecting  or connecting a battery to the charge, always turn off the  power by means of a remote switch.  Figure 12-197  shows  battery charging equipment.  

# Nickel-Cadmium Batteries  

# Chemistry and Construction  

Active materials in nickel-cadmium cells (Ni-Cad) are nickel  hydroxide (NiOOH) in the charged positive plate (Anode)  and sponge cadmium (Cd) in the charged negative plate  (Cathode). The electrolyte is a potassium hydroxide (KOH)  solution in concentration of 20–34 percent by weight pure  KOH in distilled water.  

Sintered nickel-cadmium cells have relatively thin sintered  nickel matrices forming a plate grid structure. The grid  structure is highly porous and is impregnated with the active  positive material (nickel-hydroxide) and the negative material  (cadmium-hydroxide). The plates are then formed by sintering  nickel powder to fine-mesh wire screen. In other variations  of the process, the active material in the sintered matrix is  converted chemically, or thermally, to an active state and  then formed. In general, there are many steps to these cycles  of impregnation and formation. Thin sintered plate cells are  ideally suited for very high rate charge and discharge service.  Pocket plate nickel-cadmium cells have the positive or negative  active material, pressed into pockets of perforated nickel-plated  steel plates or into tubes. The active material is trapped securely  in contact with a metal current collector so active material  shedding is largely eliminated. Plate designs vary in thickness  

![](images/fcb8e9ab6f4fb3ab22d4fdf0d7820402c01766a1b055d86724155dd5875774b4.jpg)

depending upon cycling service requirements. The typical open  circuit cell voltage of a nickel-cadmium battery is about 1.25  volts.  Figure 12-198  shows a nickel-cadmium aircraft battery.  

# Operation of Nickel-Cadmium Cells  

When a charging current is applied to a nickel-cadmium  battery, the negative plates lose oxygen and begin forming  metallic cadmium. The active material of the positive plates,  nickel-hydroxide, becomes more highly oxidized. This  process continues while the charging current is applied or  until all the oxygen is removed from the negative plates and  only cadmium remains.  

Toward the end of the charging cycle, the cells emit gas. This  also occurs if the cells are overcharged. This gas is caused by  decomposition of the water in the electrolyte into hydrogen  at the negative plates and oxygen at the positive plates. The  voltage used during charging, as well as the temperature,  determines when gassing occurs. To completely charge a  nickel-cadmium battery, some gassing, however slight, must  take place; thus, some water is used.  

The chemical action is reversed during discharge. The  positive plates slowly give up oxygen, which is regained by  the negative plates. This process results in the conversion of  the chemical energy into electrical energy. During discharge,  the plates absorb a quantity of the electrolyte. On recharge,  the level of the electrolyte rises and, at full charge, the  electrolyte is at its highest level. Therefore, water should be  added only when the battery is fully charged.  

The nickel-cadmium battery is usually interchangeable with  the lead-acid type. When replacing a lead-acid battery with  a nickel-cadmium battery, the battery compartment must be  clean, dry, and free of all traces of acid from the old battery.  The compartment must be washed out and neutralized with  ammonia or boric acid solution, allowed to dry thoroughly,  and then painted with an alkali resisting varnish.  

The pad in the battery sump jar should be saturated with a  three percent (by weight) solution of boric acid and water  before connecting the battery vent system.  

# General Maintenance and Safety Precautions  

Refer to the battery manufacturer for detailed service  instructions. Below are general recommendations for  maintenance and safety precautions. For vented nickel- cadmium cells, the general maintenance requirements are:  

1.	 Hydrate cells to supply water lost during overcharging. 2.	 Maintain inter-cell connectors at proper torque values. 3.	 Keep cell tops and exposed sides clean and dry.  

Electrolyte spillage can form grounding paths. White moss  around vent cap seals is potassium carbonate   $(\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3})$  .  Clean up these surfaces with distilled water and dry. While  handling the caustic potassium hydroxide electrolyte, wear  safety goggles to protect the eyes. The technician should also  wear plastic gloves and an apron to protect skin and clothes.  In case of spillage on hands or clothes, neutralize the alkali  immediately with vinegar or dilute boric acid solution (one  pound per gallon of water); then rinse with clear water.  

During overcharging conditions, explosive mixtures of  hydrogen and oxygen develop in nickel-cadmium cells.  When this occurs, the cell relief valves vent these gases  to the atmosphere, creating a potentially explosive hazard.  Additionally, room ventilation should be such as to prevent  a hydrogen build up in closed spaces from exceeding one  percent by volume. Explosions can occur at concentrations  above four percent by volume in air.  

# Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) Batteries  

In many applications, sealed lead acid (SLA) batteries  are gaining in use over flooded lead acid and Ni-Cad  batteries. One leading characteristic of Ni-Cad batteries is  that they perform well in low voltage, full-discharge, high  cycle applications. However, they do not perform as well  

![](images/1ca9ee5e93fdfedabe722f6d90890d8303d9c1634b1f02f8534bff9d57933dd3.jpg)  
Figure 12-196.   Battery charging methods.  

in extended standby applications, such as auxiliary or as  emergency battery packs used to power inertial reference  units or stand-by equipment (attitude gyro).  

It is typical during the servicing of a Ni-Cad battery to  match as many as twenty individual cells in order to prevent  unbalance and thus cell reversal during end of discharge.  When a Ni-Cad does reverse, very high pressure and heat  can result. The result is often pressure seal rupture, and in  the worst case, a cell explosion. With SLA batteries, cell  matching is inherent in each battery. Ni-Cads also have an  undesirable characteristic caused by constant overcharge  and infrequent discharges, as in standby applications. It is  technically known as “voltage depression” and commonly  but erroneously called “memory effect.” This characteristic  is only detectable when a full discharge is attempted. Thus,  it is possible to believe a full charge exists, while in fact it  does not. SLA batteries do not have this characteristic voltage  depression (memory) phenomenon, and therefore do not  require scheduled deep cycle maintenance as do Ni-Cads.  

The Ni-Cad emergency battery pack requires relatively  complicated test equipment due to the complex characteristics  of the Ni-Cad. Sealed lead acid batteries do not have these  temperamental characteristics and therefore it is not necessary  to purchase special battery maintenance equipment. Some  manufacturers of SLA batteries have included in the battery  packs a means by which the battery can be tested while still  installed on the aircraft. Ni-Cads must have a scheduled  energy test performed on the bench due to the inability to  measure their energy level on the aircraft, and because of  their notable “memory” shortcoming.  

The SLA battery can be designed to alert the technician if a  battery is failing. Furthermore, it may be possible to test the  failure detection circuits by activating a Built in Test (BITE)  button. This practice significantly reduces FAA paperwork and  maintenance workload.  Figure 12-199  shows a SLA battery.  

![](images/01146c0aae5fd1e4ccb4d353623031f71c7d1b121528f79fcfad1c5068c1fae8.jpg)  
Figure 12-197.   Battery charger.  

# Lithium-Ion Batteries  

Lithium-ion batteries are the primary type of battery for  many consumer type of equipment, such as cell phones,  battery-powered tools, and computers, but now they are also  being used in commercial and military aircraft. The FAA has  certified lithium-ion batteries to be used on aircraft and one  of the first aircraft to utilize the lithium-ion battery is the  Boeing 787. The three primary functional components of a  lithium-ion battery are the positive and negative electrodes and  electrolyte. Generally, the negative electrode of a conventional  lithium-ion cell is made from carbon. The positive electrode is  a metal-oxide, and the electrolyte is a lithium salt in an organic  solvent. The electrochemical roles of the electrodes reverse  between anode and cathode, depending on the direction of  current flow through the cell. Lithium-ion batteries can be  dangerous under some conditions and can pose a safety  hazard since they contain, unlike other rechargeable batteries,  a flammable electrolyte and are also kept pressurized. Under  certain conditions, they can overheat and a fire can occur.  The Boeing 787 aircraft utilizes two large 32V 8 cell lithium- ion batteries. These batteries are much lighter and more  powerful than Ni-Cad batteries used in similar-sized aircraft.  These batteries can produce   $150~\mathrm{A}$   for airplane power up.  Figure 12-200  shows a B787 battery.  

# Inverters  

An inverter is used in some aircraft systems to convert a  portion of the aircraft’s DC power to AC. This AC is used  mainly for instruments, radio, radar, lighting, and other  accessories. These inverters are usually built to supply  current at a frequency of 400 cps, but some are designed to  provide more than one voltage; for example, 26 volt AC in  one winding and 115 volts in another.  

There are two basic types of inverters: the rotary and the  static. Either type can be single-phase or multiphase. The  multiphase inverter is lighter for the same power rating than  the single-phase, but there are complications in distributing  multiphase power and in keeping the loads balanced.  

![](images/c3000cda54c94874e941c41ec7270e5f23768cb2a23a5d03cffccb6b2b5c3388.jpg)  
Figure 12-198.   Nickel-Cadmium aircraft battery.  

# Rotary Inverters  

There are many sizes, types, and configurations of rotary  inverters. Such inverters are essentially AC generators and  DC motors in one housing. The generator field, or armature,  and the motor field, or armature, are mounted on a common  shaft that rotates within the housing. One common type of  rotary inverter is the permanent magnet inverter.  

# Permanent Magnet Rotary Inverter  

A permanent magnet inverter is composed of a DC motor  and a permanent magnet AC generator assembly. Each has a  separate stator mounted within a common housing. The motor  armature is mounted on a rotor and connected to the DC supply  through a commutator and brush assembly. The motor field  windings are mounted on the housing and connected directly  to the DC supply. A permanent magnet rotor is mounted at  the opposite end of the same shaft as the motor armature, and  the stator windings are mounted on the housing, allowing  AC to be taken from the inverter without the use of brushes.  Figure 12-201  shows an internal wiring diagram for this  type of rotary inverter. The generator rotor has six poles,  magnetized to provide alternate North and South poles about  its circumference.  

When the motor field and armature are excited, the rotor  begins to turn. As the rotor turns, the permanent magnet rotates  within the AC stator coils, and the magnetic flux developed  by the permanent magnets are cut by the conductors in the AC  stator coils. An AC voltage is produced in the windings whose  polarity changes as each pole passes the windings.  

This type inverter may be made multiphase by placing more  AC stator coils in the housing in order to shift the phase the  proper amount in each coil.  

As the name of the rotary inverter indicates, it has a revolving  armature in the AC generator section.  Figure 12-202  shows  the diagram of a revolving armature, three phase inverter.  

The DC motor in this inverter is a four pole, compound wound  motor. The four field coils consist of many turns of fine wire,  with a few turns of heavy wire placed on top. The fine wire  is the shunt field, connected to the DC source through a filter  and to ground through a centrifugal governor. The heavy  wire is the series field, which is connected in series with the  motor armature. The centrifugal governor controls the speed  by shunting a resistor that is in series with the shunt field  when the motor reaches a certain speed.  

The alternator is a three-phase, four-pole, star-connected AC  generator. The DC input is supplied to the generator field  coils and connected to ground through a voltage regulator.  

The output is taken off the armature through three slip rings  to provide three-phase power. The inverter would be a single- phase inverter if it had a single armature winding and one  slip ring. The frequency of this type unit is determined by  the speed of the motor and the number of generator poles.  

# Inductor-Type Rotary Inverter  

Inductor-type inverters use a rotor made of soft iron laminations  with grooves cut laterally across the surface to provide poles  that correspond to the number of stator poles.  [Figure 12-203]   The field coils are wound on one set of stationary poles and the  AC armature coils on the other set of stationary poles. When  DC is applied to the field coils, a magnetic field is produced.  The rotor turns within the field coils and, as the poles on the  rotor align with the stationary poles, a low reluctance path for  flux is established from the field pole through the rotor poles  to the AC armature pole and through the housing back to the  field pole. In this circumstance, there is a large amount of  magnetic flux linking the AC coils.  

When the rotor poles are between the stationary poles, there  is a high reluctance path for flux, consisting mainly of air;  then, there is a small amount of magnetic flux linking the AC  coils. This increase and decrease in flux density in the stator  induces an alternating current in the AC coils.  

The number of poles and the speed of the motor determine  the frequency of this type of inverter. The DC stator field  current controls the voltage. A cutaway view of an inductor- type rotary inverter is shown in  Figure 12-204 .  

Figure 12-205  is a simplified diagram of a typical aircraft  AC power distribution system, utilizing a main and a standby  rotary inverter system.  

# Static Inverters  

In many applications where continuous DC voltage must be  converted to alternating voltage, static inverters are used in  place of rotary inverters or motor generator sets. The rapid  progress made by the semiconductor industry is extending  

![](images/f527f906c97d69404a53d7acb333b77bce7ecb11c4cdf0b8c0ad7cd97853f5f8.jpg)  
Figure 12-199.   Sealed battery.  

the range of applications of such equipment into voltage and  power ranges that would have been impractical a few years  ago. Some such applications are power supplies for frequency  sensitive military and commercial AC equipment, aircraft  emergency AC systems, and conversion of wide frequency  range power to precise frequency power.  [Figure 12-206]  

The use of static inverters in small aircraft also has increased  rapidly in the last few years, and the technology has advanced to  the point that static inverters are available for any requirement  filled by rotary inverters. For example, 250 VA emergency AC  supplies operated from aircraft batteries are in production,  as are 2,500 VA main AC supplies operated from a varying  frequency generator supply. This type of equipment has certain  advantages for aircraft applications, particularly the absence  of moving parts and the adaptability to conduction cooling.  

Static inverters, referred to as solid-state inverters, are  manufactured in a wide range of types and models that can  be classified by the shape of the AC output waveform and  the power output capabilities. One of the most commonly  used static inverters produces a regulated sine wave output. A  block diagram of a typical regulated sine wave static inverter  is shown in  Figure 12-207 . This inverter converts a low DC  voltage into higher AC voltage. The AC output voltage is  held to a very small voltage tolerance, a typical variation  of less than 1 percent with a full input load change. Output  taps are normally provided to permit selection of various  voltages; for example, taps may be provided for 105, 115,  and 125 volt AC outputs. Frequency regulation is typically  within a range of one cycle for a 0–100 percent load change.  Variations of this type of static inverter are available, many  of which provide a square wave output.  

![](images/6e8cc022c0a18354570e78292502e6674678a8730176f6489ffb6f4243a417dd.jpg)

considerably smaller, more compact, and much lighter in  weight than rotary inverters. Depending on the output power  rating required, static inverters that are no larger than a typical  airspeed indicator can be used in aircraft systems. Some of  the features of static inverters are:  

1.	 High efficiency 2.	 Low maintenance, long life 3.	 No warmup period required 4.	 Capable of starting under load 5.	 Extremely quiet operation 6.	 Fast response to load changes  

Static inverters are commonly used to provide power for  such frequency sensitive instruments as the attitude gyro and  directional gyro. They also provide power for autosyn and  magnesyn indicators and transmitters, rate gyros, radar, and  other airborne applications.  Figure 12-208  is a schematic of  a typical small jet aircraft auxiliary battery system. It shows  the battery as input to the inverter and the output inverter  circuits to various subsystems.  

# Semiconductors  

To understand why solid-state devices function as they do,  it is necessary to examine the composition and nature of  semiconductors. The two most common materials used for  semiconductors are germanium and silicon. The essential  characteristic of these elements is that each atom has four  valence electrons to share with adjacent atoms in forming  bonds. While both elements are used in semiconductor  construction, silicon is preferred in most modern applications  due to its ability to operate over a wider range of temperatures.  The nature of a bond between two silicon atoms is such that  each atom provides one electron to share with the other.  The two electrons shared are in fact shared equally between  the two atoms. This form of sharing is known as a covalent  bond. Such bonds are very stable and hold the two atoms  together very tightly requiring much energy to break this  bond.  [Figure 12-209]  In this case, all of the outer electrons  are used to make covalent bonds with other silicon atoms.  In this condition, because all of the outer shell atoms are  used, silicon takes on the characteristic of a good insulator,  due to the fact that there are no open positions available for  electrons to migrate through the orbits.  

For the silicon crystal to conduct electricity, there must be  some means available to allow some electrons to move from  place to place within the crystal, regardless of the covalent  bonds present between the atoms. One way to accomplish this  is to introduce an impurity, such as arsenic or phosphorus, into  the crystal structure, which either provides an extra electron  or create a vacant position in the outer shell for electrons  

![](images/c058e2f0170d9c9ae9490506fa09de557013cb38cf1c576547dc7736179665c7.jpg)  
Figure 12-201.   Internal wiring diagram of single-phase permanent magnet rotary inverter.  

to pass though. The method used to create this condition is  called doping.  

# Doping  

Doping is the process by which small amounts of additives  called impurities are added to the semiconductor material  to increase their current flow by adding a few electrons or  a few holes. Once the material is doped, it then falls into  one of two categories: the N-type semiconductor and the  P-type semiconductor.  

An N-type semiconductor material is one that is doped with  an N-type or a donor impurity. Elements such as phosphorus,  arsenic, and antimony are added as impurities and have five  outer electrons to share with other atoms. This causes the  semiconductor material to have an excess electron. Due to  the surplus of electrons, the electrons are then considered the  majority current carriers. This electron can easily be moved  with only a small applied electrical voltage. Current flow  in an N-type silicon material is similar to conduction in a  copper wire. That is, with voltage applied across the material,  electrons will move through the crystal towards the positive  terminal just like current flows in a copper wire.  

A P-type semiconductor is one that is doped with a P-type or  an acceptor impurity. Elements such as boron, aluminum, and  gallium have only three electrons in the valence shell to share  with the silicon atom. Those three electrons form covalent  bonds with adjacent silicon atoms. However, the expected  fourth bond cannot be formed and a complete connection  is impossible here, leaving a “hole” in the structure of the  crystal. There is an empty place where an electron would  naturally go, and often an electron moves into that space.  

![](images/b09dfeec27aa14749d3000250dc201e9a8ea6a3e4e79abc7a63344b79c90af8e.jpg)  
Figure 12-202.   Internal wiring diagram of three-phase, revolving armature.  

However, the electron filling the hole left a covalent bond  behind to fill this empty space, which leaves another hole  behind as it moves. Another electron may then move into  that particular hole, leaving another hole behind. As this  progression continues, holes appear to move as positive  charges throughout the crystal. This type of semiconductor  material is designated P-type silicon material.  Figure 12-210 shows the progression of a hole moving through a number  of atoms. Notice that the hole illustrated at the far left of  top depiction of  Figure 12-210  attracts the next valence  electron into the vacancy, which then produces another  vacancy called a hole in the next position to the right. Once  again, this vacancy attracts the next valence electron. This  exchange of holes and electrons continues to progress and  can be viewed in one of two ways. The first way that this  flow can be seen as that of electron movement. The electron  is shown in  Figure 12-210  as moving from the right to the  left through a series of holes. Likewise, the second depiction  in  Figure 12-210  of the motion of the vacated hole can be  seen as migrating from the left to the right. This view is often  called hole movement. The valence electron in the structure  progresses along a path detailed by the arrows. Holes,

however, move along a path opposite that of the electrons.  

# PN Junctions & the Basic Diode  

A single type of semiconductor material by itself is not very  useful. Useful applications are developed only when a single  component contains both P-type and N-type materials. The  semiconductor diode is also known as a PN junction diode.  This is a two-element semiconductor device that makes  use of the rectifying properties of a PN junction to convert  alternating current into direct current by permitting current  flow in one direction only.  

Figure 12-211  illustrates the electrical characteristics of  an unbiased diode, which means that no external voltage  is applied. The P-side in the illustration is shown to have  many holes, while the N-side shows many electrons. The  electrons on the N-side tend to diffuse out in all directions.  When an electron enters the P region, it becomes a minority  carrier. By definition, a minority carrier is an electron or hole,  whichever is the less dominant carrier in a semiconductor  device. In P-type materials, electrons are the minority carrier  and in N-type material, the hole is considered the minority  carrier. With so many holes around the electron, the electron  soon drops into a hole. When this occurs, the hole then  disappears, and the conduction band electron becomes a  valence electron.  

Each time an electron crosses the PN junction, it creates a  pair of ions.  Figure 12-211  shows this area outlined by dashed  lines. The circled plus signs and the circled negative signs  are the positive and negative ions, respectively. These ions  are fixed in the crystal and do not move around like electrons  or holes in the conduction band. Thus, the depletion zone  constitutes a layer of a fixed charge. An electrostatic field,  represented by a small battery in  Figure 12-211 , is established  across the junction between the oppositely charged ions.  

The junction barrier is an electrostatic field, which has been  created by the joining of a section of N-type and P-type  material. Because holes and electrons must overcome this  field to cross the junction, the electrostatic field is usually  called a barrier. Because there is a lack or depletion of free  electrons and holes in the area around the barrier, this area is  called the depletion region.  [Figure 12-211]  As the diffusion  of electrons and holes across the junction continue, the  strength of the electrostatic field increases until it is strong  enough to prevent electrons or holes from crossing over.  At this point, a state of equilibrium exists, and there is no  further movement across the junction. The electrostatic field  created at the junction by the ions in the depletion zone is  called a barrier.  

# Forward Biased Diode  

Figure 12-212  illustrates a forward biased PN junction. When  an external voltage is applied to a PN junction, it is called  bias. In a forward biased PN junction or diode, the negative  voltage source is connected to the N-type material and the  positive voltage source is connected to the P-type material.  In this configuration, the current can easily flow. If a battery  is used to bias the PN junction and it is connected in such a  way that the applied voltage opposes the junction field, it has  the effect of reducing the junction barrier and consequently  aids in the current flow through the junction.  

The electrons move toward the junction and the right end  of the diode becomes slightly positive. This occurs because  electrons at the right end of the diode move toward the  junction and leave positively charged atoms behind. The  positively charged atoms then pull electrons into the diode  from the negative terminal of the battery.  

When electrons on the N-type side approach the junction,  they recombine with holes. Basically, electrons are flowing  into the right end of the diode, while the bulk of the electrons  in the N-type material move toward the junctions. The  left edge of this moving front of electrons disappears by  dropping into holes at the junction. In this way, there is a  continuous current of electrons from the battery moving  toward the junction.  

![](images/65a44daa1693a37112f868537537091cf5d08b2369d860a47cd292bb5e5707e6.jpg)  
Figure 12-204.   Cutaway view of inductor-type rotary inverter.  

When the electrons hit the junction, they then become  valence electrons. Once a valence electron, they can then  move through the holes in the P-type material. When the  valence electrons move through the P-type material from  the right to the left, a similar movement is occurring with  the holes by moving from the left side of the P-type material  to the right. Once the valence electron reaches the end of  the diode, it then flows back into the positive terminal of  the battery.  

# In summary:  

1.	 Electron leaves negative terminal of the battery and  enters the right end (N-type material) of the diode. 2.	 Electron then travels through the N-type material. 3.	 The electron nears the junction and recombines and  becomes a valence electron. 4.	 The electron now travels through the P-type material  as a valence electron. 5.	 The electron then leaves the diode and flows back to  the positive terminal of the battery.  

# Reverse Biased Diode  

When the battery is turned around as shown in  Figure 12-213 ,  then the diode is reverse biased and current does not flow. The  most noticeable effect seen is the widened depletion zone.  

The applied battery voltage is in the same direction as the  depletion zone field. Because of this, holes and electrons tend  to move away from the junction. Simply stated, the negative  terminal attracts the holes away from the junction, and the  positive terminal attracts the electrons away from the barrier.  Therefore, the result is a wider depletion zone. This action  increases the barrier width because there are more negative  ions on the P-side of the junction and more positive ions on  the N-side of the junction. This increase in the number of  ions at the junction prevents current flow across the barrier  by the majority carriers.  

To summarize, the important thing to remember is that these  PN junction diodes offer very little resistance to current when  the diode is forward biased. Maximum resistance happens

when the diode is reversed biased.  Figure 12-214  shows a  graph of the current characteristics of a diode that is biased  in both directions.  

# Rectifiers  

Many devices in an aircraft require high amperage, low  voltage DC for operation. This power may be furnished by  DC engine-driven generators, motor generator sets, vacuum  tube rectifiers, or dry disk or solid-state rectifiers.  

In aircraft with AC systems, a special DC generator is not  desirable since it would be necessary for the engine accessory  section to drive an additional piece of equipment. Motor  generator sets, consisting of air-cooled AC motors that drive  DC generators, eliminate this objection because they operate  directly off the AC power system. Vacuum tube or various  types of solid-state rectifiers provide a simple and efficient  method of obtaining high voltage DC at low amperage.  Dry disk and solid-state rectifiers, on the other hand, are an  excellent source of high amperage at low voltage.  

A rectifier is a device that transforms AC into DC by limiting  or regulating the direction of current flow. The principal  types of rectifiers are dry disk and solid state. Solid-state,  or semiconductor, rectifiers have replaced virtually all  other types; and, since dry disk and motor generators are  largely limited to older model aircraft, the major part of the  study of rectifiers is devoted to solid-state devices used for  rectification. The two methods discussed in this handbook

Figure 12-208.   Auxiliary battery system using static inverter.  

are the half-wave rectifier and the full-wave rectifier.  

# Half-Wave Rectifier  

Figure 12-215  illustrates the basic concept of a half-wave  rectifier. When an AC signal is on a positive swing as shown  in  Figure 12-215A , the polarities across the diode and the load  resistor are also positive. In this case, the diode is forward  biased and can be replaced with a short circuit as shown in  the figure. The positive portion of the input signal appears  across the load resistor with no loss in potential across the  series diode.  

Figure 12-215B  now shows the input signal being reversed.  Note that the polarities across the diode and the load resistor are  also reversed. In this case, the diode is now reverse biased and  can be replaced with an equivalent open circuit. The current  in the circuit is now 0 amperes and the voltage drop over the  load resistor is 0 volts. The resulting waveform for a complete

sinusoidal input can be seen at the far right of  Figure 12-215 .  The output waveform is a reproduction of the input waveform  minus the negative voltage swing of the wave. For this reason,  this type of rectifier is called a half-wave rectifier.

Figure 12-211.   Depletion region.  

# Full-Wave Rectifier  

Figure 12-216  illustrates a more common use of the diode as  a rectifier. This type of a rectifier is called a full-wave bridge  rectifier. The term “full-wave” indicates that the output is a  continuous sequence of pulses rather than having gaps that  appear in the half-wave rectifier.  

Figure 12-216C  shows the initial condition, during which, a  positive portion of the input signal is applied to the network.  Note the polarities across the diodes. Diodes D2 and D4 are  reverse biased and can be replaced with an open circuit.  Diodes D1 and D3 are forward biased and act as an open  circuit. The current path through the diodes is clear to see, and  the resulting waveform is developed across the load resistor.  

During the negative portion of the applied signal, the diodes  reverse their polarity and bias states. The result is a network  shown in  Figure 12-216D . Current now passes through diodes  D4 and D2, which are forward biased, while diodes D1 and  D3 are essentially open circuits due to being reverse biased.  Note that during both alternations of the input waveform, the  current passes through the load resistor in the same direction.  This results in the negative swing of the waveform being  flipped up to the positive side of the time line.  

# Dry Disk  

Dry disk rectifiers operate on the principle that electric  current flows through a junction of two dissimilar conducting  materials more readily in one direction than it does in the  opposite direction. This is true because the resistance to  current flow in one direction is low, while in the other  direction it is high. Depending on the materials used, several  amperes may flow in the direction of low resistance but only  

![](images/503e7e0335658981b8e959a1e9f8685773ec4d61e9228f54250f16b95f990452.jpg)  
Figure 12-212.   Forward biased PN junction.  

a few milliamperes in the direction of high resistance.  

Three types of dry disk rectifiers may be found in aircraft:  the copper oxide rectifier, the selenium rectifier, and the  magnesium copper-sulfide rectifier. The copper oxide  rectifier consists of a copper disk upon which a layer of  copper oxide has been formed by heating.  [Figure 12-217]   It may also consist of a chemical copper oxide preparation  spread evenly over the copper surface. Metal plates, usually  lead plates, are pressed against the two opposite faces of the  disk to form a good contact. Current flow is from the copper  to the copper oxide.  

The selenium rectifier consists of an iron disk, similar to a  washer, with one side coated with selenium. Its operation is  similar to that of the copper oxide rectifier. Current flows  from the selenium to the iron.  

The magnesium copper sulfide rectifier is made of washer- shaped magnesium disks coated with a layer of copper  sulfide. The disks are arranged similarly to the other types.  Current flows from the magnesium to the copper sulfide.  

# Types of Diodes  

Today, there are many varieties of diodes that can be grouped  into one of several basic categories.  

# Power Rectifier Diodes  

The rectifier diode is usually used in applications that require  high current, such as power supplies. The range in which  the diode can handle current can vary anywhere from one  ampere to hundreds of amperes. One common example  of diodes is the series of diodes, part numbers 1N4001  to 1N4007. The “1N” indicates that there is only one PN  junction, or that the device is a diode. The average current  carrying range for these rectifier diodes is about one ampere  with a peak inverse voltage between 50 volts to 1,000 volts.  Larger rectifier diodes can carry currents up to 300 amperes  when forward biased and have a peak inverse voltage of 600  volts. A recognizable feature of the larger rectifier diodes  is that they are encased in metal in order to provide a heat  

![](images/21985dcf3e270280599f375300cb50681abf26f7cd1429b6ae00db7a705e2417.jpg)  
Figure 12-213.   Reversed diode.  

# Zener Diodes  

Zener diodes (sometimes called “breakdown diodes”) are  designed so that they break down (allow current to pass)  when the circuit potential is equal to or in excess of the  desired reverse bias voltage. The range of reverse bias  breakdown-voltages commonly found can range from 2  volts to 200 volts depending on design. Once a specific  reverse bias voltage has been reached, the diode conducts  and behaves like a constant voltage source. Within the  normal operating range, the zener functions as a voltage  regulator, waveform clipper, and other related functions.  Below the desired voltage, the zener blocks the circuit like  any other diode biased in the reverse direction. Because  the zener diode allows free flow in one direction when it  is used in an AC circuit, two diodes connected in opposite  directions must be used. This takes care of both alternations  of current. Power ratings of these devices range from about  250 milliwatts to 50 watts.  

# Special Purpose Diodes  

The unique characteristics of semiconductor material have  allowed for the development of many specialized types of  diodes. A short description of some of the more common diode  types is given for general familiarization.  [Figure 12-219]  

# Light-Emitting Diode (LED)  

In a forward biased diode, electrons cross the junction  and fall into holes. As the electrons fall into the valence  band, they radiate energy. In a rectifier diode, this energy  is dissipated as heat. However, in the light-emitting diode  (LED), the energy is dissipated as light. By using elements  such as gallium, arsenic, and phosphorous, an LED can be  designed to radiate colors, such as red, green, yellow, blue,  and infrared light. LEDs that are designed for the visible light  portion of the spectrum are useful for instruments, indicators,  and even cabin lighting. The advantages of the LED over the  incandescent lamps are longer life, lower voltage, faster on  and off operations, and less heat.  

![](images/0aa868c9e7e314a4e828e3946401fe1dece551f02a50d7a29a2a0454486aa867.jpg)

in the microwatt range. The liquid crystal is encapsulated  between two glass plates. When voltage is not applied to the  LCD, the display is clear. However, when a voltage is applied,  the result is a change in the orientation of the atoms of the  crystals. The incident light is then reflected in a different  direction. A frosted appearance results in the regions that have  voltage applied and permits distinguishing of numeric values.  

# Photodiode  

Thermal energy produces minority carriers in a diode. The  higher the temperature, the greater the current in a reverse  current diode. Light energy can also produce minority  carriers. By using a small window to expose the PN junction,  a photodiode can be built. When light falls upon the junction  of a reverse-biased photodiode, electrons-hole pairs are  created inside the depletion layer. The stronger the light,  the greater the number of light-produced carriers, which in  turn causes a greater magnitude of reverse-current. Because  of this characteristic, the photodiode can be used in light  detecting circuits.  

# Varactors  

# Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)  

The liquid crystal display (LCD) has an advantage over the  LED in that it requires less power to operate. Where LEDs  commonly operate in the milliwatt range, the LCD operates  The varactor is simply a variable-capacitance diode. The  reverse voltage applied controls the variable-capacitance  of the diode. The transitional capacitance decreases as  the reverse voltage is increasingly applied. In many  

![](images/902a50670a04181dda5ce10c8d82a1628d512a2964f428eeed2888be8d1fcc0f.jpg)

applications, the varactor has replaced the old mechanically  tuned capacitors. Varactors can be placed in parallel with  an inductor and provide a resonant tank circuit for a tuning  circuit. By simply varying the reverse voltage across the  varactor, the resonant frequency of the circuit can be adjusted.  

# Schottky Diodes  

Schottky diodes are designed to have metal, such as gold,  silver, or platinum, on one side of the junction and doped  silicon, usually an N-type, on the other side of the junction.  This type of a diode is considered a unipolar device because  free electrons are the majority carrier on both sides of the  junction. The Schottky diode has no depletion zone or charge  storage, which means that the switching time can be as high as   ${300}\,\mathrm{MHz}$  . This characteristic exceeds that of the bipolar diode.  

# Diode Identification  

Figure 12-218  illustrates a number of methods employed  for identifying diodes. Typically manufacturers place some  form of an identifier on the diode to indicate which end is  the anode and which end is the cathode. Dots, bands, colored  bands, the letter   $\mathbf{\epsilon}_{\mathrm{k}},$   or unusual shapes indicate the cathode  end of the diode.  

# Introduction to Transistors  

The transistor is a three-terminal device primarily used  to amplify signals and control current within a circuit.  [Figure 12-220]  The basic two-junction semiconductor must  have one type of region sandwiched between two of the other  type. The three regions in a transistor are the collector (C),  which is moderately doped, the emitter (E), which is heavily  doped, and the base (B), which is significantly less doped.  The alternating layers of semiconductor material type provide  the common commercial name for each type of transistor. The  interface between the layers is called a junction. Selenium  and germanium diodes previously discussed are examples  of junction diodes. Note that the sandwiched layer or base  is significantly thinner than the collector or the emitter. In  general, this permits a “punching through” action for the  carriers passing between the collector and emitter terminals.  

# Classification  

The transistors are classified as either NPN or PNP according  to the arrangement of their   $\mathbf{N}$   and P-materials. The NPN  transistor is formed by introducing a thin region of P-material  between two regions of N-type material. The opposite is true  for the PNP configuration.  

The two basic types of transistors along with their circuit

symbols are shown in  Figure 12-221 . Note that the two  symbols are different. The horizontal line represents the base,  and two angular lines represent the emitter and collector. The  angular line with the arrow on it is the emitter, while the line  without is the collector. The direction of the arrow on the  emitter determines whether or not the transistor is a PNP or  an NPN type. If the arrow is pointing in, the transistor is a  PNP. On the other hand, if the arrow is pointing out, then it  is an NPN type.  

# Transistor Theory  

As discussed in the section on diodes, the movement of  the electrons and holes can be considered current. Electron  current moves in one direction, while hole current travels in  the opposite direction. In transistors, both electrons and holes  act as carriers of current.  

A forward biased PN junction is comparable to a low- resistance circuit element, because it passes a high current  for a given voltage. On the other hand, a reverse-biased PN  junction is comparable to a high-resistance circuit element.  By using Ohm’s Law formula for power   $(\mathbf{P}=\operatorname{I}^{2}\!\mathbf{R})$  ) and  assuming current is held constant through both junctions, it  can be concluded that the power developed across the high  resistance junction is greater than that developed across a low  resistance junction. Therefore, if a crystal were to contain  two PN junctions, one forward biased and the other reverse  biased, and a low-power signal injected into the forward  biased junction, a high-power signal could be produced at  the reverse-biased junction.  

To use the transistor as an amplifier, some sort of external  bias voltage must modify each of the junctions. The first PN  junction (emitter-base) is biased in the forward direction.  This produces a low resistance. The second junction, which  is the collector-base junction, is reverse biased to produce a  high resistance.  [Figure 12-222]  

![](images/9f2c1b9db9d7515f08fc99d30364940c0e664b9867c420f5c036c6a7bfcb4aec.jpg)  
Figure 12-218.   General purpose diodes.  

With the emitter-base junction biased in the forward direction,  electrons leave the negative terminal of the battery and enter  the N-material. These electrons pass easily through the  emitter, cross over the junction, and combine with the hole  in the P-material in the base. For each electron that fills a  hole in the P-material, another electron leaves the P-material,  which creates a new hole and enters the positive terminal of  the battery.  

The second PN junction, which is the base-collector junction,  is reverse biased. This prevents the majority carriers from  crossing the junction, thus creating a high-resistance circuit.  It is worth noting that there still is a small current passing  through the reversed PN junction in the form of minority  carriers—that is, electrons in the P-material and holes in the  N-material. The minority carriers play a significant part in  the operation of the NPN transistor.  

Figure 12-223  illustrates the basic interaction of the NPN  junction. There are two batteries in the circuit used to bias the  NPN transistor. Vbb is considered the base voltage supply,  rated in this illustration at 1 volt, and the battery voltage  Vcc, rated at 6 volts, is called the collector voltage supply.  

Current within the external circuit is simply the movement  of free electrons originating at the negative terminal of the  battery and flowing to the N-material.  [Figure 12-223]  

As the electrons enter the N-material, they become the  majority carrier and move through the N-material to the  emitter-base PN junction. This emitter-base junction is  forward biased at about 0.65 to 0.7 volts positive with  respect to the emitter and presents no resistance to the flow of  electrons from the emitter into the base, which is composed of  P-material. As these electrons move into the base, they drop  into available holes. For every electron that drops into a hole,  another electron exits the base by way of the base lead and  becomes the base current or Ib. Of course, when one electron  leaves the base, a new hole is formed. From the standpoint of  the collector, these electrons that drop into holes are lost and  

![](images/1899ea1e4f0c0204d73bdba8023f5cde5fa81bcea6859f055134e9190887d020.jpg)  
Figure 12-219.   Schematic symbols for special purpose diodes.  

of no use. To reduce this loss of electrons, the transistor is  designed so that the base is very thin in relation to the emitter  and collector, and the base is lightly doped.  

Most of the electrons that move into the base fall under the  influence of the reverse bias of the collector. While collector- base junction is reverse biased with respect to the majority  carriers, it behaves as if it is forward biased to the electrons  or minority carriers in this case. The electrons are accelerated  through the collector-base junction and into the collector. The  collector is comprised of the N-type material; therefore, the  electrons once again become the majority carrier. Moving  easily through the collector, the electrons return to the  positive terminal of the collector supply battery Vcc, which  is shown in  Figure 12-223  as Ic.  

Because of the way this device operates to transfer current  (and its internal resistances) from the original conduction path  to another, its name is a combination of the words “transfer”  and “resistor”—transistor.  

# PNP Transistor Operation  

The PNP transistor generally works the same way as the  NPN transistor. The primary difference is that the emitter,  base, and collector materials are made of different material  than the NPN. The majority and minority current carriers  are the opposite in the PNP to that of the NPN. In the case  of the PNP, the majority carriers are the holes instead of the  electrons in the NPN transistor. To properly bias the PNP, the  polarity of the bias network must be reversed.  

# Identification of Transistors  

Figure 12-224  illustrates some of the more common transistor  lead identifications. The methods of identifying leads vary  due to a lack of a standard and require verification using  manufacturer information to properly identify. However, a  short description of the common methods is discussed below.  

Figure   $I2–224D$   shows an oval-shaped transistor. The  collector lead in this case is identified by the wide space  between it and the lead for the base. The final lead at the  far left is the emitter. In many cases, colored dots indicate  the collector lead, and short leads relative to the other leads  indicate the emitter. In a conventional power diode, as seen  in  Figure  $I2–224E$  , the collector lead is usually a part of the  mounting bases, while the emitter and collector are leads or  tines protruding from the mounting surface.  

# Field Effect Transistors  

Another transistor design that has become more important  than the bipolar transistor is the field-effect transistor (FET).  The primary difference between the bipolar transistor and the  FET is that the bipolar transistor has two PN junctions and  

![](images/bfb685035e59e9bd4f8278a3e4721993c45348ffadd502629dcecfdde40b3725.jpg)  
Figure 12-220.   Transistor.  

is a current-controlled device, while the FET has only one  PN junction and is a voltage-controlled device. Within the  FET family, there are two general categories of components.  One category is called the junction FET (JFET), which has  only one PN junction. The other category is known as the  enhancement-type or metal-oxide JET (MOSFET).  

Figure 12-225  shows the basic construction of the JFET and  the schematic symbol. In this figure, it can be seen that the  drain (D) and source (S) are connected to an N-type material,  and the gate (G) is connected to the P-type material. With  gate voltage   $\operatorname{Vag}$   set to 0 volts and drain voltage Vdd set to  some positive voltage, a current flows between the source  and the drain, through a narrow band of N-material. If then,   $\operatorname{Vagg}$   is adjusted to some negative voltage, the PN junction  is reverse biased, and a depletion zone (no charge carriers)  is established at the PN junction. By reducing the region of  noncarriers, it has the effect of reducing the dimensions of the  N-channel, resulting in a reduction of source to drain current.  

Because JFETs are voltage-controlled devices, they have some  advantages over the bipolar transistor. One such advantage  is that because the gate is reverse biased, the circuit that it  is connected to sees the gate as a very high resistance. This  means that the JFET has less of an insertion influence in the  circuit. The high resistance also means that less current is used.  

Like many other solid-state devices, careless handling and  static electricity can damage the JFET. Technicians should  take all precautions to prevent such damage.  

# Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET (MOSFET)  

Figure 12-226  illustrates the general construction and the  schematic symbol of the MOSFET transistor. The biasing  arrangement for the MOSFET is essentially the same as that  for the JFET. The term “enhancement” comes from the idea  that when there is no bias voltage applied to the gate (G),  then there is no channel for current conduction between the  

![](images/e8f951031a21a5a072f18d15b96fb953663f41b5022f6e3fef21ef61043255b7.jpg)

source (S) and the drain (D). By applying a greater voltage on  the gate (G), the P-channel begins to materialize and grow in  size. Once this occurs, the source (S) to drain (D) current Id  increases. The schematic symbol reflects this characteristic  by using a broken line to indicate that the channel does not  exist without a gate bias.  

# Common Transistor Configurations  

A transistor may be connected in one of three different  configurations: common-emitter (CE), common-base (CB),  and common-collector (CC). The term “common” is used  to indicate which element of the transistor is common  to both the input and the output. Each configuration has  its own characteristics, which makes each configuration  suitable for particular applications. A way to determine what  configuration you may find in a circuit is to first determine  which of the three transistor elements is used for the input  signal. Then, determine the element used for the output  signal. At that point, the remaining element, (base, emitter,  or collector) is the common element to both the input and  output, and thus you determine the configuration.  

# Common-Emitter (CE) Configuration  

This is the configuration most commonly used in amplifier  

![](images/394e28f48d026ddd632094f6e2257535d63dc89712638e3d028b10659486b75d.jpg)  
Figure 12-222.   NPN transistor.  

circuits because they provide good gains for voltage, current,  and power. The input signal is applied to the base-emitter  junction, which is forward biased (low resistance), and the  output signal is taken off the collector-emitter junction,  which is reverse biased (high resistance). Then the emitter  is the common element to both input and output circuits.  [Figure 12-227]  

When the transistor is connected in a CE configuration, the  input signal is injected between the base and emitter, which  is a low-resistance, low-current circuit. As the input signal  goes positive, it causes the base to go positive relative to  the emitter. This causes a decrease in the forward bias,  which in turn reduces the collector current  $\mathrm{I_{C}}$   and increases  the collector voltage (  $\mathrm{E_{C}}$   being more negative). During the  negative portion of the input signal, the voltage on the base  is driven more negative relative to the emitter. This increases  the forward bias and allows an increase in collector current  

![](images/a7b8a7a5f009496cc1bd0e53f47f1d2e3c08a762099f0732f7f918ca3b380e3f.jpg)  
Figure 12-223.   NPN Junction.  

$\mathrm{I_{C}}$   and a decrease in collector voltage (  $\mathrm{E_{C}}$    being less negative  and going positive). The collector current, which flows  through the reverse-biased junction, also flows through a  high-resistance load resulting in a high level of amplification.  

Because the input signal to the CE goes positive when the  output goes negative, the two signals are  $180^{\circ}$   out of phase.  This is the only configuration that provides a phase reversal.  The CE is the most popular of the three configurations  because it has the best combination of current and voltage  gain. Gain is a term used to indicate the magnitude of  amplification. Each transistor configuration has its unique  gain characteristics even though the same transistors are used.  

# Common-Collector (CC) Configuration  

This transistor configuration is usually used for impedance  matching. It is also used as a current driver due to its high  current gain. It is also very useful in switching circuits  since it has the ability to pass signals in either direction.  [Figure 12-227]  

In the CC circuit, the input signal is applied to the base, and the  output signal is taken from the emitter, leaving the collector as  the common point between the input and the output. The input  resistance of the CC circuit is high, while the output resistance  is low. The current gain is higher than that in the CE, but it has  a lower power gain than either the CE or CB configuration. Just  like the CB configuration, the output signal of the CC circuit  is in phase with the input signal. The CC is typically referred  to as an emitter-follower because the output developed on the  emitter follows the input signal applied to the base.  

# Common-Base (CB) Configuration  

The primary use of this configuration is for impedance  matching because it has low input impedance and high  output resistance. Two factors, however, limit the usefulness  of this circuit application. First is the low-input resistance  and second is its lack of current, which is always below 1.  Since the CB configuration gives voltage amplification, there  are some applications for this circuit, such as microphone  amplifiers.  [Figure 12-227]  

In the CB circuit, the input signal is applied to the emitter and  the output signal is taken from the collector. In this case, both  the input and the output have the base as a common element.  When an input signal is applied to the emitter, it causes the  emitter-base junction to react in the same manner as that in  the CE circuit. When an input adds to the bias, it increases  the transistor current; conversely, when the signal opposes  the bias, the current in the transistor decreases.  

The signal adds to the forward bias, since it is applied to  the emitter, causing the collector current to increase. This  increase in   $\mathrm{I_{C}}$   results in a greater voltage drop across the  

![](images/80d5dec556e0ab78b4e5ee6cdf000734852079b9e7ebd3e10378b158ce676153.jpg)

load resistor RL, thus lowering the collector voltage   $\mathrm{E_{C}}$  .  The collector voltage, in becoming less negative, swings in a  positive direction and is therefore in phase with the incoming  positive signal.  

# Vacuum Tubes  

The use of vacuum tubes in aircraft electrical and electronic  systems has rapidly declined due to the many advantages  of using transistors. However, some systems still employ  vacuum tubes in special applications, and possibly some  older model aircraft still in service are equipped with devices  that use vacuum tubes. While these components may still  be in service, their infrequent occurrence does not warrant  a detailed discussion.  

Originally, vacuum tubes were developed for radio work.  They are used in radio transmitters as amplifiers for  controlling voltage and current, as oscillators for generating  audio and radio frequency signals, and as rectifiers for  converting AC into DC. While there are many types of  vacuum tubes for a variety of applications, the most common  types fall into one of the following families: (1) diode, (2)  triode, (3) tetrode, and (4) pentode. Each of these vacuum  tube types operates on the following fundamental principles.  

When a piece of metal is heated, the speed of the electrons  in the metal is increased. If the metal is heated to a high  enough temperature, the electrons are accelerated to the  point where some of them actually leave the surface of the  metal. In a vacuum tube, electrons are supplied by a piece of  metal called a cathode, which is heated by an electric current.  Within limits, the hotter the cathode, the greater the number  of electrons it gives off or emits.  

is usually coated with special chemical compounds. If an  external field does not draw the emitted electrons away, they  form about the cathode into a negatively-charged cloud called  the space charge. The accumulation of negative electrons  near the emitter repels others coming from the emitter. The  emitter, if insulated, becomes positive because of the loss of  electrons. This establishes an electrostatic field between the  cloud of negative electrons and the now positive cathode. A  balance is reached when only enough electrons flow from the  cathode to the area surrounding it to supply the loss caused  by diffusion of the space charge.

# Filtering  

One of the more common uses of the capacitor and inductor  that the technician may find in the field is that of the filter.  

# Filtering Characteristics of Capacitors  

The nature of capacitance opposes a voltage change across its  terminal by storing energy in its electrostatic field. Whenever  the voltage tends to rise, the capacitor converts this voltage  change to stored energy. When the voltage tends to fall, the  capacitor converts this stored energy back to voltage. The use  of a capacitor for filtering the output of a rectifier is illustrated  in  Figure 12-228 .	The rectifier is shown as a block, and the  capacitor   $\mathrm{C}_{1}$   is connected in parallel with the load  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  .  

The capacitor  $\mathrm{C}_{1}$   is chosen to offer very low impedance to  the AC ripple frequency and very high impedance to the  DC component. The ripple voltage is therefore bypassed  to ground through the low impedance path of the capacitor,  while the DC voltage is applied unchanged to the load. The  effect of the capacitor on the output of the rectifier can be seen  in the waveshapes shown in  Figure 12-229 . Dotted lines show  the rectifier output, while the solid lines show the effect of  the capacitor. In this example, full-wave rectifier outputs are  shown. The capacitor  $\mathrm{C}_{1}$   charges when the rectifier voltage  output tends to increase and discharges when the voltage  output tends to decrease. In this manner, the voltage across  the load  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$   is kept fairly constant.  

# Filtering Characteristics of Inductors  

The inductance provided by an inductor may be used as a  filter, because it opposes a change in current through it by  storing energy in its electromagnetic field. Whenever the  current increases, the stored energy in the electromagnetic  field increases. When the current through the inductor  decreases, the inductor supplies the energy back into the  circuit in order to maintain the existing flow of current.  The use of an inductor for filtering the output of a rectifier  is shown in  Figure 12-230.  Note that in this network the  inductor  $\mathrm{L}_{1}$   is in series with the load  $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  .  

The inductance  $\mathrm{L}_{1}$    is selected to offer high impedance to the  AC ripple voltage and low impedance to the DC component.  The result is a very large voltage drop across the inductor  and a very small voltage drop across the load   $\mathrm{R_{1}}$  . For the  DC component, however, a very small voltage drop occurs  across the inductor and a very large voltage drop across the  load. The effect of an inductor on the output of a full-wave  rectifier in the output waveshape is shown in  Figure 12-231 .  

# Common Filter Configurations  

Capacitors and inductors are combined in various ways to  provide more satisfactory filtering than can be obtained  with a single capacitor or inductor. These are referred to  collectively as LC filters. Several combinations are shown  schematically in  Figure 12-232 . Note that the L, or inverted  L-type, and the T-type filter sections resemble schematically  

![](images/9253b5a7a59d26fc1d741267c8a8545125195276e216b17abc2fb96b1f9c6077.jpg)  
Figure 12-227.   Transistor configurations (common-emitter,  common-collector, common-base).  

the corresponding letters of the alphabet. The pi-type filter  section resembles the Greek letter pi  $(\pi)$   schematically. All the filter sections shown are similar in that the inductances  are in series and the capacitances are in parallel with the  load. The inductances must, therefore, offer very high  impedance and the capacitors very low impedance to the  ripple frequency. Since the ripple frequency is comparatively  low, the inductances are iron core coils having large values  of inductance (several henries). Because they offer such  high impedance to the ripple frequency, these coils are called  chokes. The capacitors must also be large (several microfarads)  to offer very little opposition to the ripple frequency. Because  the voltage across the capacitor is DC, electrolytic capacitors  are frequently used as filter capacitors. Always observe the  correct polarity in connecting electrolytic capacitors.  

LC filters are also classified according to the position of  the capacitor and inductor. A capacitor input filter is one in  which the capacitor is connected directly across the output  terminals of the rectifier. A choke input filter is one in which  a choke precedes the filter capacitor.  

If it is necessary to increase the applied voltage to more than  a single rectifier can tolerate, the usual solution is to stack  them. These rectifiers are similar to resistors added in series.  Each resistor drops a portion of the applied voltage rather than  the total voltage. The same theory applies to rectifiers added  in series or stacked. Series stacking increases the voltage  rating. If, for example, a rectifier is destroyed with an applied  voltage exceeding 50 volts, and it is to be used in a circuit  with an applied voltage of 150 volts, stacking of diodes can  be employed. The result is shown in  Figure 12-233 .  

# Basic LC Filters  

Analog filters are circuits that perform signal processing  functions, specifically intended to remove unwanted signal  components, such as ripple, and enhance desired signals. The  simplest analog filters are based on combinations of inductors  and capacitors. The four basic categories of filters discussed  are: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop. All these  types are collectively known as passive filters, because they  do not depend on any external power source.  

The operation of a filter relies on the characteristic of variable  inductive and capacitive reactance based on the applied  frequency. In review, the inductor blocks high-frequency  signals (high reactance) and conducts low-frequency  signals (low reactance), while capacitors do the reverse.  A filter in which the signal passes through an inductor, or  in which a capacitor provides a path to earth, presents less  attenuation (reduction) to a low-frequency signal than to a  high-frequency signal and is considered a low-pass filter. If  the signal passes through a capacitor, or has a path to ground  through an inductor, then the filter presents less attenuation  to high-frequency signals than low-frequency signals and  is then considered a high-pass filter. Typically after an AC  signal is rectified, the pulses of voltage are changed to usable  form of DC by way of filtering.  

# Low-Pass Filter  

A low-pass filter is a filter that passes low frequencies well,  but attenuates (reduces) higher frequencies. The so-called  cutoff frequency divides the range of frequencies that are  passed and the range of frequencies that are stopped. In other  words, the frequency components higher than the cutoff  frequency are stopped by a low-pass filter. The actual amount  of attenuation for each frequency varies by filter design.  

An inductive low-pass filter inserts an inductor in series with  the load, where a capacitive low-pass filter inserts a resistor  in series and a capacitor in parallel with the load. The former  filter design tries to block the unwanted frequency signal  while the latter tries to short it out.  Figure 12-234  illustrates  this type of circuit and the frequency/current flow response.  

# High-Pass Filter (HPF)  

A high-pass filter (HPF) is a filter that passes high frequencies  well, but attenuates (reduces) frequencies lower than the  cutoff frequency. The actual amount of attenuation for each  frequency varies once again depending on filter design. In  some cases, it is called a low-cut filter. A HPF is essentially  the opposite of a low-pass filter.  

It is useful as a filter to block any unwanted low frequency  components of a signal while passing the desired higher  frequencies.  Figure 12-235  illustrates this type of circuit and  the frequency/current flow response.  

# Band-Pass Filter  

A band-pass filter is basically a combination of a high-  pass and a low-pass. There are some applications where  a particular range of frequencies need to be singled out or  filtered from a wider range of frequencies. Band-pass filter  circuits are designed to accomplish this task by combining  the properties of low-pass and high-pass into a single  filter.  Figure 12-236  illustrates this type of circuit and the  frequency/current flow response.  

# Band-Stop Filter  

In signal processing, a band-stop filter or band-rejection filter  is a filter that passes most frequencies unaltered, but attenuates  those in a range to very low levels. It is the opposite of a band- pass filter. A notch filter is a band-stop filter with a narrow  stopband (high Q factor). Notch filters are used in live sound  reproduction (public address (PA) systems) and in instrument  

![](images/ab587b69efb9fa98ab3c8dbe3557df36b3a226787883c4e9eb4ec479e5f3cc87.jpg)

amplifier (especially amplifiers or preamplifiers for acoustic  instruments, such as acoustic guitar, mandolin, bass instrument  amplifier, etc.) to reduce or prevent feedback, while having  little noticeable effect on the rest of the frequency spectrum.  Other names include “band limit filter,” “T-notch filter,” “band- elimination filter,” and “band-rejection filter.”  

Typically, the width of the stop-band is less than 1 to 2  decades (that is, the highest frequency attenuated is less than  10 to 100 times the lowest frequency attenuated). In the audio  band, a notch filter uses high and low frequencies that may  be only semitones apart.  

A band-stop filter is the general case. A notch filter is a specific  type of band-stop filter with a very narrow range. Also called  band-elimination, band-reject, or notch filters, this kind of  filter passes all frequencies above and below a particular  range set by the component values. Not surprisingly, it can  be made out of a low-pass and a high-pass filter, just like  the band-pass design, except that this time we connect the  two filter sections in parallel with each other instead of in  series.  Figure 12-237  illustrates this type of circuit and the

# Amplifier Circuits  

An amplifier is a device that enables an input signal to control  an output signal. The output signal has some or all of the  characteristics of the input signal but generally is a greater  magnitude than the input signal in terms of voltage, current,  or power. Gain is the basic function of all amplifiers. Because  of this gain, we can expect the output signal to be greater than  the input signal. For example, if we have an input signal of  1 volt and an output signal of 10 volts, then the gain factor  can be determined by:  

Gain  $=$  Signal out /signal in   ${\mathrm{Gain}}=10\,{\mathrm{V}}/1\,{\mathrm{V}}=10$  

Voltage gain is usually used to describe the operation of a  small gain amplifier. In this type of an amplifier, the output  signal voltage is larger than the input signal voltage. Power  gain, on the other hand, is usually used to describe the  operation of large signal amplifiers. In the case of power gain  amplifiers, the gain is not based on voltage but on watts. A  power amplifier is an amplifier in which the output signal  power is greater than the input signal power. Most power  amplifiers are used as the final stage of amplification and  drive the output device. The output device could be a flight  deck or cabin speaker, an indicator, or antenna. Whatever the  device, the power to make it work comes from the final stage  of amplification. Drivers for autopilot servos are sometimes  contained in line replaceable units (LRUs) called autopilot  amplifiers. These units take the low signal commands from  the flight guidance system and amplify the signals to a level  usable for driving the servo motors.  

# Classification  

The classification of a transistor amplifier circuit is  determined by the percentage of the time that the current  flows through the output circuit in relation to the input signal.  There are four classifications of operation: A, AB, B, and C.  Each class of operation has a certain use and characteristic.  No individual class of amplifiers is considered the best. The  best use of an amplifier is a matter of proper selection for  the particular operation desired.

Figure 12-232.   LC filters.  

# Class A  

In the Class A operation, the current in the transistor  flows for 100 percent or   $360^{\circ}$   of the input signal.  [Figure 12-238]  Class A operation is the least efficient class  of operation but provides the best fidelity. Fidelity simply  means that the output signal is a good reproduction of the  input signal in all respects other than the amplitude, which is  amplified. In some cases, there may be some phase shifting  between the input signal and the output signal. Typically,  the phase difference is   $180^{\circ}$  . If the output signal is not a  good reproduction of the input signal, then the signal is said  to be distorted. Distortion is any undesired change to the  signal from the input to the output.  

The efficiency of an amplifier refers to the amount of power  

![](images/8d5ef25f41840426e147093149857733dd61a29e8da045d1a0224ac731f236a4.jpg)  
Figure 12-233.   Stacking diodes in a circuit.  

delivered to the output compared to the power supplied to the  circuit. Every device in the circuit consumes power in order  to operate. If the amplifier operates for  $360^{\circ}$   of input signal,  then it is using more power than if it was using only   $180^{\circ}$  of input signal. The more power consumed by the amplifier,  the less there is available for the output signal. Usually the  Class A amplifier is used where efficiency is of little concern  and where fidelity in reproduction is desired.  

# Class AB  

In the Class AB operation, the transistor current flows for more  than 50 percent but less than 100 percent of the input signal.  [Figure 12-239]  Unlike the Class A amplifier, the output  signal is distorted. A portion of the output circuit appears to  be truncated. This is due to the lack of current through the  transistor during this point of operation. When the emitter in this  case becomes positive enough, the transistor cannot conduct  because the base to emitter junction is no longer forward  biased. The input signal going positive beyond this point does  not produce any further output and the output remains level. The Class AB amplifier has a better efficiency and a poorer  fidelity than the Class A amplifier. These amplifiers are used  when an exact reproduction of the input is not required but  both the positive and negative portions of the input signals  need to be available on the output.  

# Class B  

In Class B operation, the transistor current flows for only 50  percent of the input signal.  [Figure 12-240]  In this illustration,  the base-emitter bias does not allow the transistor to conduct  whenever the input signal is greater than zero. In this case, only  the negative portion of the input signal is reproduced. Unlike  the rectifier, the Class B amplifier does not only reproduce half  of the input signal, but it also amplifies it. Class B amplifiers  are twice as efficient as the Class A amplifier because the  amplifying device only uses power for half of the input signal.  

# Class C  

In Class C operations, transistor current flows for less than  50 percent of the input signal.  [Figure 12-241]  This class of  

![](images/c3e415a597398d5ac29cc52ffe2cb009dbc862356dab58b1e659588df58765c0.jpg)  
Figure 12-234.   Low-pass filter.  

operation is the most efficient. Because the transistor does  not conduct except during a small portion of the input signal,  this is the most efficient class of amplifier. The distortion of  the Class C amplifier is greater (poor fidelity) than the Class  A, AB, and B amplifiers because a small portion of the input  signal is reproduced on the output. Class C amplifiers are used  when the output signal is used for only small portions of time.

# Methods of Coupling  

Coupling is used to transfer a signal from one stage on an  amplifier to another stage. Regardless of whether an amplifier  is a single stage or one in a series of stages, there must be a  method for the signal to enter and leave the circuit. Coupling  is the process of transferring the energy between circuits.  There are a number of ways for making this transfer and to  discuss these methods in detail goes beyond the scope of this  handbook. However, four methods are listed below with a  brief description of their operation.  

# Direct Coupling  

Direct coupling is the connection of the output of one stage  directly to the input of the next stage. Direct coupling provides  a good frequency response because no frequency-sensitive  components, such as capacitors and inductors, are used. Yet  this method is not used very often due to the complex power  supply requirements and the impedance matching problems.  

# RC Coupling  

RC coupling is the most common method of coupling and  

![](images/a070dcf93f06e68bb55d818dbd20b940fe3dc360545fe94562c7681543e44975.jpg)  
Figure 12-236.   Band-pass filter.  

uses a coupling capacitor and signal developing resistors.  [Figure 12-242]  In this circuit, R1 acts as a load resistor  for Q1 and develops the output signal for that stage. The  capacitor C1 blocks the DC bias signal and passes the AC  output signal. R2 then becomes the load over which the  passes AC signal is developed as an input to the base of Q2.  This arrangement allows for the bias voltage of each stage to  be blocked, while the AC signal is passed to the next stage.  

# Impedance Coupling  

Impedance coupling uses a coil as a load for the first  stage but otherwise functions just as an RC coupling.  [Figure 12-243]  This method is similar to the RC coupling  method. The difference is that R1 is replaced with inductor  L1 as the output load. The amount of signal developed on the  output load depends on the inductive reactance of the coil. In  order for the inductive reactance to be high, the inductance  must be large; the frequency must be high or both. Therefore,  load inductors should have relatively large amounts of  inductance and are most effective at high frequencies.  

# Transformer Coupling  

Transformer coupling uses a transformer to couple the signal  

![](images/0d0388e1e153479ead717eef535784fa94b6eafcb8a58ba9bb7bd15f0e5e1018.jpg)  
Figure 12-237.   Band-stop filter.  

from one stage to the next.  [Figure 12-244]  The transformer  action of T1 couples the signal from the first stage to the second  stage. The primary coil of T1 acts as a load for the output of  the first stage while the secondary coil acts as the developing  impedance for the second stage Q2. Transformer coupling is very  efficient and the transformer can aid in impedance matching.  

# Feedback  

Feedback occurs when a small portion of the output signal is  sent back to the input signal to the amplifier. There are two  types of feedback in amplifiers:  

1.	 Positive (regenerative) 2.	 Negative (degenerative)  

The main difference between these two signals is whether  the feedback signal adds to the input signal or if the feedback  signal diminishes the input signal.  

When the feedback is positive, the signal being returned to  the input is in phase with the input signal and thus interferes  constructively.  Figure 12-245  illustrates this concept applied  in the amplified circuit through a block diagram. Notice  that the feedback signal is in phase with the input signal,  which regenerates the input signal. This results in an output  signal with amplitude greater than would have been without  the constructive, positive feedback. This type of positive  feedback is what causes an audio system to squeal.  

Figure 12-245  also illustrates with a block diagram how  negative or degenerative feedback occurs. In this case, the  feedback signal is out of phase with the input signal. This  causes destructive interference and degenerates the input  signal. The result is a lower amplitude output signal than  would have occurred without the feedback.  

# Operational Amplifiers (OP AMP)  

An operational amplifier (OP AMP) is designed to be used  with other circuit components and performs either computing  functions or filtering.  [Figure 12-246]  Operational amplifiers  are usually high-gain amplifiers with the amount of gain  governed by the amount of feedback.  

Operational amplifiers were originally developed for analog  computers and used to perform mathematical functions.  Today many devices use the operational amplifier for DC  amplifiers, AC amplifiers, comparators, oscillators, and filter  circuits. The widespread use is due to the fact that the OP  AMP is a versatile device, small, and inexpensive. Built into  the integrated chip, the operational amp is used as a basic  building block of larger circuits.  

There are two inputs to the operational amplifier, inverting  $(-)$  and non-inverting   $(+)$  , and there is one output. The polarity  

![](images/7dde46d367d111d958140e5e4374b148f67781da658050b990a901d6fb991d5c.jpg)  
Figure 12-238.   Simplified Class A amplifier circuit.  

of a signal applied to the inverting input  $(-)$   is reversed at the  output. A signal applied to the non-inverting  $(+)$   input retains  its polarity on the output. To be classified as an operational  amplifier, the circuit must have certain characteristics:  

1.	 Very high gain 2.	 Very high input impedance 3.	 Very high output impedance  

This type of a circuit can be made up of discrete components,  such as resistors and transistors. However, the most common  form of an operational amplifier is found in the integrated  circuit. This integrated circuit or chip contains the various  stages of the operational amplifier and can be treated as if it  were a single stage.  

# Applications  

The number of applications for OP AMPs is too numerous to  detail in this handbook. However, the technician occasionally  comes across these devices in modern aircraft and should be  able to recognize their general purpose in a circuit. Some of  the basic applications are:  

1.	 Go/no-go detectors 2.	 Square wave circuits 3.	 Non-inverting amplifier 4.	 Inverting amplifier

# Magnetic Amplifiers  

Magnetic amplifiers do not amplify magnetism but use  electromagnetism to amplify a signal. Essentially, the  magnetic amplifier is a power amplifier with a very limited  frequency response. The frequency range most commonly  associated with the magnetic amplifier is   $100~\mathrm{Hz}$   and less,  which places it in the audio range. As a technical point, the  magnetic amplifier is a low-frequency amplifier.  

Advantages of the magnetic amplifier are:  

1.	 Very high efficiency, on the order of approximately  90 percent 2.	 High reliability 3.	 Very rugged, able to withstand vibrations, moisture,  and overloads 4.	 No warm-up time  

Some of the disadvantages of the magnetic amplifier are:  

1.	 Incapacity to handle low-voltage signals 2.	 Not usable in high-frequency applications 3.	 Time delay associated with magnetic affects 4.	 Poor fidelity  

The basic operating principles of the magnetic amplifier are  fairly simple. Keep in mind that all amplifiers are current  control devices. In this particular case, power that is delivered  

![](images/acfd91c9d8c36679d132736ff963460c4884d77d07fcb1d29cf0166d8ae6473e.jpg)  
Figure 12-242.   Simplified RC coupling circuit.  

to the load is controlled by a variable inductance.  

If an AC voltage is applied to the primary winding of an  iron core transformer, the iron core is magnetized and  demagnetized at the same frequency as that of the applied  voltage. This, in turn, induces a voltage in the transformers  secondary winding. The output voltage across the terminals  of the secondary depends on the relationship of the number  of turns in the primary and the secondary of the transformer.  

The iron core of the transformer has a saturation point  after which the application of a greater magnetic force  produces no change in the intensity of magnetization.  Hence, there is no change in transformer output, even if the  input is greatly increased. The magnetic amplifier circuit  in  Figure 12-247  is used to explain how a simple magnetic  amplifier functions.  

1.	 Assume that there is 1 ampere of current in coil A,  which has 10 turns of wire. If coil B has 10 turns of  wire, an output of 1 ampere is obtained if coil B is  properly loaded. 2.	 By applying direct current to coil C, the core of the  magnetic amplifier coil can be further magnetized.  Assume that coil C has the proper number of turns and,  upon the application of 30 milliamperes, that the core  

![](images/820a762f1ffc116375c9e47f6e42304fdb2bc4bd87af3ba641237ebe954a7207.jpg)  
Figure 12-243.   Simplified impedance coupling circuit.  

is magnetized to the point where 1 ampere on coil A  results in only 0.24 ampere output from coil B.  

3.	 By making the DC input to coil C a continuous variable  from 0 to 30 milliamperes and by maintaining an  input of 1 ampere on coil A, it is possible to control  the output of coil B to any point between 0.24 ampere  and 1 ampere in this example.  

The term “amplifier” is used for this arrangement because,  by use of a few milliamperes, control of an output of 1 or  more amperes is obtained.  

# Saturable-Core Reactor  

The same procedure can be used with the circuit shown  in  Figure 12-248 . A saturable-core reactor is a magnetic- core coil whose reactance is controlled by changing the  permeability of the core. Varying the unidirectional flux  controls the permeability of the core.  

By controlling the extent of magnetization of the iron ring,  it is possible to control the amount of current flowing to  the load, since the amount of magnetization controls the  impedance of the AC input winding. This type of magnetic  amplifier is called a simple saturable reactor circuit.  

Adding a rectifier to such a circuit would remove half the  cycle of the AC input and permit DC to flow to the load. The  amount of DC flowing in the load circuit is controlled by a  DC control winding (sometimes referred to as bias). This type  of magnetic amplifier is referred to as being self-saturating.  

To use the full AC input power, a circuit such as that shown  in  Figure 12-249  may be used. This circuit uses a full-wave  bridge rectifier. The load receives a controlled DC by using  the full AC input. This type of circuit is known as a self- saturating, full-wave magnetic amplifier.  

In  Figure 12-250,  it is assumed that the DC control winding  is supplied by a variable source, such as a sensing circuit. To  

![](images/c828f5f19ed5dfa0eb1297514d88dce36fd99bd323fc5a6d361fc8c674fbb841.jpg)

Figure 12-245.   Feedback.  

control such a source and use its variations to control the AC  output, it is necessary to include another DC winding that has  a constant value. This winding, referred to as the reference  winding, magnetizes the magnetic core in one direction.  

The DC control winding, acting in opposition to the reference  winding, either increases (degenerative) or decreases  (regenerative) the magnetization of the core to change the  amount of current flowing through the load. This is essentially  a basic preamplifier.  

# Logic Circuits  

Logic is considered the science of reasoning—the development  of a reasonable conclusion based on known information.  Human reasoning tells us that certain propositions are true if  certain conditions or premises are true. An annunciator being  lit in the master warning panel is an example of a proposition,  which is either true or false. For example, predetermined and  designed conditions must be met in order for an annunciator  in a master warning panel to be lit. A “LOW HYDRAULIC  PRESS” annunciator may have a simple set of conditions  that cause it to be illuminated. If the conditions are met, such  as a hydraulic reservoir that is low on fluid causing the line  press to be low, then the logic is true and the annunciator  lights. Several propositions, when combined, form a logical  function. In the example above, the “LOW HYDRAULIC  PRESS” annunciator is on if the LED is not burned out and  the hydraulic press is low or if the LED is not burned out  and the annunciator test is being asserted.  

This section on logic circuits only serves as an introduction  to the basic concepts. The technician encounters many  

![](images/8ef60ea988db7adc919fa75b70d2d01a538aafeba99cf7087203b5898cb834e4.jpg)  
Figure 12-246.   Schematic symbol for the operational amplifier.  

situations or problems in everyday life that can be expressed  in some form of a logical function. Many problems and  situations can be condensed down to simple yes⁄no or  true⁄false statements that, if logically ordered, can filter  a problem down to a reasonable answer. The digital logic  circuits are well suited for this task and have been employed  in today’s integrated circuits found in virtually all of the  devices that we take for granted in modern aircraft. These  logical circuits are used to carry out the logical functions for  such things as navigation and communications. There are  several fundamental elements that form the building blocks  of the complex digital systems found in line replaceable  units (LRUs) and avionics card cages. The following is  a very basic outline of what those elements are and what  logic conditions they process. It is far beyond the scope of  this handbook to cover digital logic systems due to the vast  body of knowledge that it represents. However, this serves  as an introduction and, in some limited cases, is useful in  reading system block diagrams that use logic symbols to aid  the technician in understanding how a given circuit operates.  

# Logic Polarity  

Electrical pulses can represent two logic conditions and  any two differing voltages can be used for this purpose. For  example, a positive voltage pulse could represent a true or 1  condition and a negative voltage pulse could then represent a  false or 0 logic condition. The condition in which the voltage  changes to represent a true or 1 logic is known as the logic  polarity. Logic circuits are usually divided into two broad  classes: positive polarity and negative polarity. The voltage  levels used and a statement indicating the use of positive  or negative logic is usually specified in the logic diagrams  provided by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  

# Positive  

When a signal that activates a circuit to a 1, true or high  condition, has an electrical level that is relatively more  positive than the other 0 or false condition, then the logic  polarity is said to be positive. An example would be:  

Active State:	1 or True  $=+5$   volts direct current (VDC) 	 0 or False  $=-5$   VDC  

# Negative  

When the signal that actives a circuit to a 1, true or high  condition, has an electrical level that is relatively more  negative than the other 0 or false condition, then the logic  polarity is said to be negative. An example would be:  

Active State:	1 or True  $=0$   VDC                       0 or False  $=+5$   VDC  

# Pulse Structure  

Figure 12-251  illustrates the positive and negative pulse in an  idealized form. In both forms, the pulse is composed of two  edges—one being the leading edge and the other the trailing  edge. In the case of the positive pulse logic, the positive  transition from a lower state to a higher state is the leading  edge and the trailing edge is the opposite. In the case of the  negative logic pulse, the negative transition from a higher  state to a lower state is the leading edge while the rise from  the lower state back to the higher state is the trailing edge. Figure 12-251  is considered an ideal pulse because the rise  and fall times are instantaneous. In reality, these changes  take time, although in actual practice, the rise and fall can  be assumed as instantaneous.  Figure 12-252  shows the non- ideal pulse and its characteristics. The time required for a  pulse to go from a low state to a high state is called the rise  

![](images/ae264656fe5887b8244d00edda2b1ec0062504802bcd8dedcf7d998be9d35ebc.jpg)  
Figure 12-247.   Magnetic amplifier circuit.  

time, and the time required for the pulse to return to zero is  called the fall time. It is common practice to measure the rise  and fall time between 10 percent amplitude and 90 percent  amplitude. The reason for taking the measurements in these  points is due to the non-linear shape of the pulse in the first  10 percent and final 90 percent of the rise and fall amplitudes.  The pulse width is defined as the duration of the pulse. To be  more specific, it is the time between the 50 percent amplitude  point on both the pulse rise and fall.  

# Basic Logic Circuits  

Boolean logic is a symbolic system used in representing the  truth value of statements. It is employed in the binary system  used by digital computers primarily because the only truth  values (true and false) can be represented by the binary digits  1 and 0. A circuit in computer memory can be open or closed,  depending on the value assigned to it. The fundamental  operations of Boolean logic, often called Boolean operators,  are “and,” “or,” and “not;” combinations of these make up 13  other Boolean operators. Six of these operators are discussed.  

# The Inverter Logic  

The inverter circuit performs a basic logic function called  inversion. The purpose of the inverter is to convert one logic  

![](images/7f179f3deb9ff291dc1d80658bc78e495f51ed11984a6c7f71397302837dd71e.jpg)  
Figure 12-248.   Saturable CORE reactor circuit.  

state into the opposite state. In terms of a binary digit, this  would be like converting a 1 to a 0 or a 0 to a 1. When a  high voltage is applied to the inverter input, low voltage is  the output. When a low voltage is applied to the input, a high  voltage is on the output. This operation can be put into what  is known as a logic or truth table. The standard logic symbol  is shown in  Figure 12-253 .  Figure 12-254  shows the possible  logic states for this gate. This is the common symbol for an  amplifier with a small circle on the output. This type of logic  can also be considered a NOT gate.  

# The AND Gate  

The AND gate is made up of two or more inputs and a single  output. The logic symbol is shown in  Figure 12-255 . Inputs  are on the left and the output is on the right in each of the  depictions. Gates with two, three, and four inputs are shown;  however, any number of inputs can be used in the AND logic  as long as the number is greater than one. The operation of  the AND gate is such that the output is high only when all  of the inputs are high. If any of the inputs are low, the output  is also low. Therefore, the basic purpose of an AND gate is  to determine when certain conditions have been met at the  same time. A high level on all inputs produces a high level  on the output.  Figure 12-256  shows a simplified diagram of  the AND logic with two switches and a light bulb. Notice that  both switches need to be closed in order for the light bulb to  turn on. Any other combination of switch positions is an open  circuit and the light does not turn on. An example of AND  logic could possibly be engage logic found in an autopilot. In  this case, the autopilot would not be allowed to be engaged  unless certain conditions are first met. Such conditions could  be: Vertical gyro is valid AND directional gyro is valid AND  all autopilot control knobs are in detents AND servo circuits  are operational. Only when these conditions are met does the

autopilot engage.  [Figure 12-257]  

# The OR Gate  

The OR gate has two or more inputs and one output and  is normally represented by the standard logic symbol and  truth table.  [Figure 12-258]  Note that the OR gate can have  any number of inputs as long as it is greater than one. The  operation of the OR gate is such that a high on any one of  the inputs produces a high on the output. The only time that a  low is produced on the output is if there are no high levels on  any input.  Figure 12-259  is a simplified circuit that illustrates  the OR logic. The example used is a “DOOR UNSAFE”  annunciator. Let’s say in this case that the plane has one  cabin door and a baggage door. In order for the annunciator  light on the master warning panel to extinguish, both doors  must be closed and locked. If any one of the doors is not  secured properly, the baggage door OR the cabin door, then  the “DOOR UNSAFE” annunciator illuminates. In this case,  two switches are in parallel with each other. If either one of  the two switches is closed, the light bulb lights up. The lamp  is off only when both switches are open.  

# The NAND Gate  

The term NAND is a combination of the NOT-AND gate  and indicates an AND function with an inverted output. A  standard logic symbol for a two input NAND gate is shown  in  Figure 12-260 . Notice that an equivalent AND gate with  an inverter is also shown. The logical operation of the NAND  gate is such that a low output occurs only if all inputs are high.  If any of the inputs are low, the output is high. An example  of a two input NAND gate and its corresponding truth table  are shown in  Figure 12-261 .  

# The NOR Gate  

The term NOR is a combination of the NOT and OR and  indicates an OR function with an inverted output. The  standard logic symbol for a two-inputs NOR gate is shown  in  Figure 12-263 . Notice that an equivalent AND gate with  an inverter is also shown. The logical operation of the NOR  gate is such that a low output happens when any of its inputs  are high. Only when all of its inputs are low is the output  high. The logic of this gate produces resultant outputs that  are the opposite of the OR gate. In the NOR gate, the low  output is the active output level.  Figure 12-263  illustrates  the logical operation of a two-input NOR gate for all of its  possible combinations and the truth table.  

# Exclusive OR Gate  

The exclusive OR gate is a modified OR gate that produces a  1 output when only one of the inputs is a 1. The abbreviation  often used is X-OR. It is different from the standard OR gate  in that when both inputs are a 1, then the output remains at  a 0. The standard symbol and truth table for the X-OR gate  are shown in  Figure 12-264 .  

# Exclusive NOR Gate  

The exclusive NOR (X-NOR) gate is nothing more than an  X-OR gate with an inverted output. It produces a 1 output  when all inputs are 1s and also when all inputs are 0s. The  standard symbol is shown in  Figure 12-265 .  

# The Integrated Circuit  

All of the logic functions so far discussed plus many other  components are available in some form of an integrated  circuit. The digital systems found in today’s aircraft owe  their existence to a large extent to the design of the integrated  circuit (IC). In most cases, the IC has an advantage over the  use of discrete components in that they are smaller, consume  less power, are very reliable, and are inexpensive. The most  noticeable characteristic of the IC is its size and in comparison  to the discrete semiconductor component, can easily be on  the order of thousands of times smaller.  [Figure 12-266]\  

A monolithic integrated circuit is an electronic circuit  that is constructed entirely on a single chip or wafer of  semiconductor material. All of the discrete components,  such as resistors, transistors, diodes, and capacitors, can  be constructed on these small pieces of semiconductor  material and are an integral part of the chip. There are  a number of levels of integration. Those levels are:  small-scale integration, medium-scale integration, large- scale integration, and microprocessors. The small-scale  integration is considered the least complex design of  the digital ICs. These ICs contain the basic components,  such as the AND, OR, NOT, NOR and NAND gates.  [Figure 12-267]  The medium-scale integration can contain

Figure 12-251.   Positive and negative pulse in an idealized form.  

the same components as found in the small-scale design but  in larger numbers ranging from 12 to 100. The medium- scale designs are house circuits that are more complex, such  as encoders, decoders, registers, counters, multiplexers,  smaller memories, and arithmetic circuits.  [Figure 12-268] The large-scale integrated circuits contain even more logic  gates, larger memories than the medium-scale circuits, and  in some cases microprocessors.  

# Microprocessors  

The microprocessor is a device that can be programmed  to perform arithmetic and logical operations and other  functions in a preordered sequence. The microprocessor is  usually used as the central processing unit (CPU) in today’s  computer systems when it is connected to other components,  such as memory chips and input/output circuits. The basic  arrangement and design of the circuits residing in the  microprocessor is called the architecture.

# DC Generators  

# Theory of Operation  

In the study of alternating current, basic generator principles  were introduced to explain the generation of an AC voltage  by a coil rotating in a magnetic field. Since this is the basis  for all generator operation, it is necessary to review the  principles of generation of electrical energy.  

When lines of magnetic force are cut by a conductor passing  through them, voltage is induced in the conductor. The  strength of the induced voltage is dependent upon the speed  of the conductor and the strength of the magnetic field. If  the ends of the conductor are connected to form a complete  circuit, a current is induced in the conductor. The conductor  and the magnetic field make up an elementary generator.  

This simple generator is illustrated in  Figure 12-269 ,  together with the components of an external generator

circuit which collect and use the energy produced by the  simple generator. The loop of wire  [Figure 12-269A  and  $B J$  is arranged to rotate in a magnetic field. When the plane of  the loop of wire is parallel to the magnetic lines of force,  the voltage induced in the loop causes a current to flow in  the direction indicated by the arrows in  Figure 12-269 . The  voltage induced at this position is maximum, since the wires  are cutting the lines of force at right angles, thus cutting  more lines of force per second than in any other position  relative to the magnetic field. As the loop approaches the  vertical position shown in  Figure 12-270 , the induced  voltage decreases because both sides of the loop (A and B)  are approximately parallel to the lines of force and the rate

of cutting is reduced. When the loop is vertical, no lines  of force are cut since the wires are momentarily traveling  parallel to the magnetic lines of force, and there is no  induced voltage. As the rotation of the loop continues, the  number of lines of force cut increases until the loop has  rotated an additional   $90°$   to a horizontal plane. As shown  in  Figure 12-271 , the number of lines of force cut and the  induced voltage once again are maximum. The direction  of cutting, however, is in the opposite direction to that  occurring in  Figures 12-269  and  12-270 , so the direction  (polarity) of the induced voltage is reversed. As rotation  of the loop continues, the number of lines of force having  been cut again decreases, and the induced voltage becomes  zero at the position shown in  Figure 12-272 , since the wires  A and B are again parallel to the magnetic lines of force. If the voltage induced throughout the entire  $360^{\circ}$   of rotation

is plotted, the curve shown in  Figure 12-273  results. This  voltage is called an alternating voltage because of its reversal  from positive to negative value, first in one direction and  then in the other.  

To use the voltage generated in the loop for producing a current  flow in an external circuit, some means must be provided to  connect the loop of wire in series with the external circuit.  Such an electrical connection can be effected by opening the  loop of wire and connecting its two ends to two metal rings,  called slip rings, against which two metal or carbon brushes  ride. The brushes are connected to the external circuit. By  replacing the slip rings of the basic AC generator with two  half cylinders, called a commutator, a basic DC generator is  obtained.  [Figure 12-274]  In this illustration, the black side of  the coil is connected to the black segment, and the white side  of the coil to the white segment. The segments are insulated  from each other. The two stationary brushes are placed on  opposite sides of the commutator and are so mounted that each  brush contacts each segment of the commutator as the latter  revolves simultaneously with the loop. The rotating parts of a

DC generator (coil and commutator) are called an armature.  The generation of an emf by the loop rotating in the magnetic  field is the same for both AC and DC generators, but the action  of the commutator produces a DC voltage.  

# Generation of a DC Voltage  

Figure 12-275  illustrates in an elementary, step-by-step  manner, how a DC voltage is generated. This is accomplished  by showing a single wire loop rotating through a series of  positions within a magnetic field.  

# Position A  

The loop starts in position A and is rotating clockwise.  However, no lines of force are cut by the coil sides,  which means that no emf is generated. The black brush is  shown coming into contact with the black segment of the  commutator, and the white brush is just coming into contact  with the white segment.

Figure 12-263.   Logical operation of two-input NOR gate and truth  table.  

# Position B  

In position B, the flux is now being cut at a maximum rate,  which means that the induced emf is maximum. At this time,  the black brush is contacting the black segment, and the  white brush is contacting the white segment. The deflection  of the meter is toward the right, indicating the polarity of  the output voltage.  

# Position   $c$  

At position C, the loop has completed  $180^{\circ}$   of rotation. Like  position A, no flux lines are being cut and the output voltage  is zero. The important condition to observe at position C is  the action of the segments and brushes. The black brush at the   $180^{\circ}$   angle is contacting both black and white segments on  one side of the commutator, and the white brush is contacting  both segments on the other side of the commutator. After the  

![](images/5f09c359e2e170acec37a4b4735bd544cf7f278e56479d31715a9f0549ff3616.jpg)

loop rotates slightly past the   $180^{\circ}$   point, the black brush is  contacting only the white segment, and the white brush is  contacting only the black segment.  

Because of this switching of commutator elements, the  black brush is always in contact with the coil side moving  downward, and the white brush is always in contact with the  coil side moving upward. Though the current actually reverses  its direction in the loop in exactly the same way as in the AC  generator, commutator action causes the current to flow always  in the same direction through the external circuit or meter.  

# Position D  

At position D, commutator action reverses the current in  the external circuit, and the second half cycle has the same  waveform as the first half cycle. The process of commutation  is sometimes called rectification, since rectification is the  converting of AC voltage to DC voltage.  

# The Neutral Plane  

At the instant that each brush is contacting two segments on  the commutator [ Figure 12-275A, C,  and  $E]$  , a direct short  circuit is produced. If an emf were generated in the loop at  this time, a high current would flow in the circuit, causing  an arc and thus damaging the commutator. For this reason,  the brushes must be placed in the exact position where the  short occurs when the generated emf is zero. This position is  called the neutral plane. If the brushes are installed properly,  no sparking occurs between the brushes and the commutator.  Sparking is an indication of improper brush placement, which  is the main cause of improper commutation.  

The voltage generated by the basic DC generator in  Figure 12-275  varies from zero to its maximum value twice  for each revolution of the loop. This variation of DC voltage  is called “ripple,” and may be reduced by using more loops,  or coils, as shown in  Figure 12-276A . As the number of loops

is increased, the variation between maximum and minimum  values of voltage is reduced  [Figure 12-276B] , and the output  voltage of the generator approaches a steady DC value. In  Figure 12-276A,  the number of commutator segments is  increased in direct proportion to the number of loops; that  is, there are two segments for one loop, four segments for  two loops, and eight segments for four loops.  

The voltage induced in a single turn loop is small. Increasing  the number of loops does not increase the maximum value  of generated voltage, but increasing the number of turns  in each loop increases this value. Within narrow limits,  the output voltage of a DC generator is determined by the  product of the number of turns per loop, the total flux per  pair of poles in the machine, and the speed of rotation of  the armature.  

An AC generator, or alternator, and a DC generator are  identical as far as the method of generating voltage in the  rotating loop is concerned. However, if the current is taken  from the loop by slip rings, it is an alternating current, and  the generator is called an AC generator, or alternator. If the  current is collected by a commutator, it is direct current, and  the generator is called a DC generator.  

# Construction Features of DC Generators  

Generators used on aircraft may differ somewhat in design,  since various manufacturers make them. All, however, are of  the same general construction and operate similarly. The major  parts, or assemblies, of a DC generator are a field frame (or  yoke), a rotating armature, and a brush assembly. The parts  of a typical aircraft generator are shown in  Figure 12-277 .  

# Field Frame  

The field frame is also called the yoke, which is the  foundation or frame for the generator. The frame has two  functions: It completes the magnetic circuit between the  poles and acts as a mechanical support for the other parts of  the generator. In  Figure 12-278A , the frame for a two-pole  generator is shown in a cross-sectional view. A four-pole  generator frame is shown in  Figure 12-278B .

Figure 12-273.   Output of an elementary generator.  

In small generators, the frame is made of one piece of iron,  but in larger generators, it is usually made up of two parts  bolted together. The frame has high magnetic properties and,  together with the pole pieces, forms the major part of the  magnetic circuit. The field poles are bolted to the inside of  the frame and form a core on which the field coil windings  are mounted.  [Figure 12-278]  

The poles are usually laminated to reduce eddy current  losses and serve the same purpose as the iron core of an  electromagnet; that is, they concentrate the lines of force  produced by the field coils. The entire frame, including field  poles, is made from high-quality magnetic iron or sheet steel.  

A practical DC generator uses electromagnets instead of  permanent magnets. To produce a magnetic field of the  necessary strength with permanent magnets would greatly  increase the physical size of the generator.  

The field coils are made up of many turns of insulated wire  and are usually wound on a form that fits over the iron core of  the pole to which it is securely fastened.  [Figure 12-279]  The  

![](images/c543da39dcf6fbca3af6461dc68cf221daafdd7800f5f4ca46e550a860f2c04e.jpg)  
Figure 12-274.   Basic DC generator.  

exciting current, which is used to produce the magnetic field  and which flows through the field coils, is obtained from an  external source or from the generated DC of the machine.  No electrical connection exists between the windings of the  field coils and the pole pieces.  

Most field coils are connected so that the poles show  alternate polarity. Since there is always one North pole for  each South pole, there must always be an even number of  poles in any generator.  

Note that the pole pieces in  Figure 12-278  project from the  frame. Because air offers a great amount of reluctance to the  magnetic field, this design reduces the length of the air gap  between the poles and the rotating armature and increases the  efficiency of the generator. When the pole pieces are made to  project they are called salient poles.  [Figure 12-278]

Figure 12-275.   Operation of a basic DC generator.  

# Armature  

The armature assembly of a generator consists of many  armature coils wound on an iron core, a commutator, and  associated mechanical parts. These additional loops of wire  are actually called windings and are evenly spaced around  the armature so that the distance between each winding is  the same. Mounted on a shaft, it rotates through the magnetic  field produced by the field coils. The core of the armature acts  as an iron conductor in the magnetic field and, for this reason,  is laminated to prevent the circulation of eddy currents.  

# Gramme-Ring Armature  

There are two general kinds of armatures: the ring and the  drum.  Figure 12-280  shows a ring-type armature made up of  an iron core, an eight-section winding, and an eight-segment  commutator. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that  the windings, located on the inner side of the iron ring, cut  few lines of flux. As a result, they have very little voltage  induced in them. For this reason, the Gramme ring armature  is not widely used.  

# Drum-Type Armature  

A drum-type armature is shown in  Figure 12-281 . The  armature core is in the shape of a drum and has slots cut into  it where the armature windings are placed. The advantage is  that each winding completely surrounds the core so that the  entire length of the conductor cuts through the magnetic flux.  The total induced voltage in this arrangement is far greater  than that of the Gramme ring-type armature.  

Drum-type armatures are usually constructed in one of  two methods: lap winding and the wave winding. Each  method having its own advantage. Lap windings are used in  generators that are designed for high current. The windings  are connected in parallel paths and for this reason require  several brushes. The wave winding is used in generators that  are designed for high voltage outputs. The two ends of each  coil are connected to commutator segments separated by the  distance between poles. This results in a series arrangement  of the coils and is additive of all the induced voltages.  

# Commutators  

Figure 12-282  shows a cross-sectional view of a typical  commutator. The commutator is located at the end of an  armature and consists of wedge shaped segments of hard drawn  copper, insulated from each other by thin sheets of mica. The  segments are held in place by steel V-rings or clamping flanges  fitted with bolts. Rings of mica insulate the segments from the  flanges. The raised portion of each segment is called a riser,  and the leads from the armature coils are soldered to the risers.  When the segments have no risers, the leads are soldered to  short slits in the ends of the segments.  

the electrical contact between the armature coils and the  external circuit. A flexible, braided copper conductor,  commonly called a pigtail, connects each brush to the external  circuit. The brushes, usually made of high-grade carbon and  held in place by brush holders insulated from the frame, are  free to slide up and down in their holders in order to follow  any irregularities in the surface of the commutator. The  brushes are usually adjustable so that the pressure of the  brushes on the commutator can be varied and the position  of the brushes with respect to the segments can be adjusted.  

The constant making and breaking of connections to the coils  in which a voltage is being induced necessitates the use of  material for brushes, which has a definite contact resistance.  Also, this material must be such that the friction between the  commutator and the brush is low, to prevent excessive wear.  For these reasons, the material commonly used for brushes is  high-grade carbon. The carbon must be soft enough to prevent  undue wear of the commutator and yet hard enough to provide  reasonable brush life. Since the contact resistance of carbon  is fairly high, the brush must be quite large to provide a large  area of contact. The commutator surface is highly polished to  reduce friction as much as possible. Oil or grease must never  be used on a commutator, and extreme care must be used  when cleaning it to avoid marring or scratching the surface.

Figure 12-276.   Increasing the number of coils reduces the ripple  in the voltage.  

The brushes ride on the surface of the commutator, forming  

# Armature Reaction  

Current flowing through the armature sets up electromagnetic  fields in the windings. These new fields tend to distort or  bend the magnetic flux between the poles of the generator  from a straight-line path. Since armature current increases  with load, the distortion becomes greater with an increase in  load. This distortion of the magnetic field is called armature  reaction.  [Figure 12-283]  

Armature windings of a generator are spaced so that, during  rotation of the armature, there are certain positions when the  brushes contact two adjacent segments, thereby shorting the  armature windings to these segments. When the magnetic  field is not distorted, there is usually no voltage being  induced in the shorted windings, and therefore no harmful  results occur from the shorting of the windings. However,  when the field is distorted, a voltage is induced in these  shorted windings, and sparking takes place between the  brushes and the commutator segments. Consequently, the  commutator becomes pitted, the wear on the brushes becomes  excessive, and the output of the generator is reduced. To  correct this condition, the brushes are set so that the plane of  the coils, which are shorted by the brushes, is perpendicular  to the distorted magnetic field, which is accomplished by  moving the brushes forward in the direction of rotation. This  operation is called shifting the brushes to the neutral plane  or plane of commutation. The neutral plane is the position  where the plane of the two opposite coils is perpendicular  to the magnetic field in the generator. On a few generators,  the brushes can be shifted manually ahead of the normal  neutral plane to the neutral plane caused by field distortion.  On nonadjustable brush generators, the manufacturer sets  the brushes for minimum sparking.  

Compensating windings or interpoles may be used to  counteract some of the effects of field distortion, since  shifting the brushes is inconvenient and unsatisfactory,  especially when the speed and load of the generator are  changing constantly.  

# Compensating Windings  

The compensating windings consist of a series of coils  embedded in slots in the pole faces. These coils are also  connected in series with the armature. Consequently, this series  connection with the armature produces a magnetic field in the  compensating windings that varies directly with the armature  current. The compensating windings are wound in such a  manner that the magnetic field produced by them counteracts  the magnetic field produced by the armature. As a result, the  neutral plane remains stationary any magnitude of armature  current. With this design, once the brushes are set correctly,  they do not need to be moved again.  Figure 12-284A  illustrates  how the windings are set into the pole faces.

Figure 12-278.   A two-pole and a four-pole frame assembly.  

# Interpoles  

An interpole is a pole placed between the main poles of a  generator. An example of interpole placement is shown in  Figure 12-284B . This is a simple two-pole generator with  two interpoles.  

An interpole has the same polarity as the next main pole in  the direction of rotation. The magnetic flux produced by  an interpole causes the current in the armature to change  direction as an armature winding passes under it. This  cancels the electromagnetic fields about the armature  windings. The magnetic strength of the interpoles varies with  the load on the generator; and since field distortion varies  with the load, the magnetic field of the interpoles counteracts  the effects of the field set up around the armature windings  and minimizes field distortion. Thus, the interpole tends to  keep the neutral plane in the same position for all loads on  

![](images/406a0cf19905c22f12d1eb2ef0533de5c345e54e5e2981e8c538b018a7cb0e45.jpg)  
Figure 12-279.   A field coil removed from a field pole.  

the generator; therefore, field distortion is reduced by the  interpoles, and the efficiency, output, and service life of the  brushes are improved.  

# Types of DC Generators  

There are three types of DC generators: series wound, shunt  wound, and shunt series or compound wound. The difference  in type depends on the relationship of the field winding to  the external circuit.  

# Series Wound DC Generators  

The field winding of a series generator is connected in series  with the external circuit called the load.  [Figure 12-285]  The  field coils are composed of a few turns of large wire; the  magnetic field strength depends more on the current flow rather  than the number of turns in the coil. Series generators have very  poor voltage regulation under changing load, since the greater  the current through the field coils to the external circuit, the  greater the induced emf and the greater the terminal or output  voltage. Therefore, when the load is increased, the voltage  increases; likewise, when the load is decreased, the voltage

decreases. The output voltage of a series wound generator  may be controlled by a rheostat in parallel with the field  windings.  [Figure 12-285A]  Since the series wound generator  has such poor regulation, it is never employed as an airplane  generator. Generators in airplanes have field windings, which  are connected either in shunt or in compound.  

# Shunt Wound DC Generators  

A generator having a field winding connected in parallel  with the external circuit is called a shunt generator.  [Figure 12-286A  and  B]  The field coils of a shunt generator  contain many turns of small wire; the magnetic strength  is derived from the large number of turns rather than the  current strength through the coils. If a constant voltage is  desired, the shunt wound generator is not suitable for rapidly  fluctuating loads. Any increase in load causes a decrease  in the terminal or output voltage, and any decrease in load  causes an increase in terminal voltage; since the armature  and the load are connected in series, all current flowing in  the external circuit passes through the armature winding.  Because of the resistance in the armature winding, there is  a voltage drop (IR drop  $=$  current  $\times$   resistance). As the load  increases, the armature current increases and the IR drop in  the armature increases. The voltage delivered to the terminals  is the difference between the induced voltage and the voltage  drop; therefore, there is a decrease in terminal voltage. This  decrease in voltage causes a decrease in field strength,  because the current in the field coils decreases in proportion  to the decrease in terminal voltage; with a weaker field, the  voltage is further decreased. When the load decreases, the  output voltage increases accordingly, and a larger current  flows in the windings. This action is cumulative, so the output  voltage continues to rise to a point called field saturation,  after which there is no further increase in output voltage.  

The terminal voltage of a shunt generator can be controlled  by means of a rheostat inserted in series with the field  windings.  [Figure 12-286A]  As the resistance is increased,  the field current is reduced; consequently, the generated  voltage is reduced also. For a given setting of the field  rheostat, the terminal voltage at the armature brushes is  approximately equal to the generated voltage minus the IR  

![](images/2e0a15911a8cf4aabcddc2794d66c61731deeed820f51942a4f6d38df7b3d547.jpg)  
Figure 12-282.   Commutator with portion removed to show construction.  

drop produced by the load current in the armature; thus, the  voltage at the terminals of the generator drops as the load is  applied. Certain voltage sensitive devices are available that  automatically adjust the field rheostat to compensate for  variations in load. When these devices are used, the terminal  voltage remains essentially constant.  

# Compound Wound DC Generators  

A compound wound generator combines a series winding  and a shunt winding in such a way that the characteristics  of each are used to advantage. The series field coils are  made of a relatively small number of turns of large copper  conductor, either circular or rectangular in cross section, and  are connected in series with the armature circuit. These coils  are mounted on the same poles on which the shunt field coils  are mounted and, therefore, contribute a magnetomotive  force which influences the main field flux of the generator.  A diagrammatic and a schematic illustration of a compound  wound generator is shown in  Figure 12-287A  and  $B$  .  

![](images/ac383f591b8b898b3b1a2fdddb80a7e1ac6edf312f58e91b3030ecad0d1decda.jpg)  
Figure 12-283.   Armature reaction.  

If the ampere turns of the series field act in the same direction  as those of the shunt field, the combined magnetomotive force  is equal to the sum of the series and shunt field components.  Load is added to a compound generator in the same manner  in which load is added to a shunt generator, by increasing  the number of parallel paths across the generator terminals.  Thus, the decrease in total load resistance with added load  is accompanied by an increase in armature circuit and series  field circuit current. The effect of the additive series field is  that of increased field flux with increased load. The extent of  the increased field flux depends on the degree of saturation  of the field as determined by the shunt field current. Thus, the  terminal voltage of the generator may increase or decrease with  load, depending on the influence of the series field coils. This  influence is referred to as the degree of compounding. A flat  compound generator is one in which the no load and full load  voltages have the same value; whereas an under compound  generator has a full load voltage less than the no load value,  and an over compound generator has a full load voltage which  is higher than the no load value. Changes in terminal voltage  with increasing load depend upon the degree of compounding.  

If the series field aids the shunt field, the generator is said  to be cumulative compounded. If the series field opposes  the shunt field, the machine is said to be differentially  compounded or is called a differential generator. Compound  generators are usually designed to be overcompounded.  This feature permits varied degrees of compounding by  connecting a variable shunt across the series field. Such a  shunt is sometimes called a diverter. Compound generators  are used where voltage regulation is of prime importance.  

Differential generators have somewhat the same characteristics  as series generators in that they are essentially constant  current generators. However, they generate rated voltage at  no load, the voltage dropping materially as the load current  increases. Constant current generators are ideally suited as  power sources for electric arc welders and are used almost  universally in electric arc welding.  

If the shunt field of a compound generator is connected across  both the armature and the series field, it is known as a long  shunt connection, but if the shunt field is connected across  the armature alone, it is called a short shunt connection.  These connections produce essentially the same generator  characteristics. A summary of the characteristics of the various  types of generators discussed is shown in  Figure 12-288 .  

# Generator Ratings  

A generator is rated in power output. Since a generator is  designed to operate at a specified voltage, the rating usually  is given as the number of amperes the generator can safely  

![](images/4c0d6fcc1559952854a29e6c3200d712035a03cc10cc3c8eed8d7732ce9d6c8f.jpg)  
Figure 12-284.   Simple two-pole generator with two interpoles.  

supply at its rated voltage. Generator rating and performance  data are stamped on the nameplate attached to the generator.  When replacing a generator, it is important to choose one of  the proper rating.  

The rotation of generators is termed either clockwise or  counterclockwise, as viewed from the driven end. Usually,  the direction of rotation is stamped on the data plate. If  no direction is stamped on the plate, the rotation may be  marked by an arrow on the cover plate of the brush housing.  It is important that a generator with the correct direction of  rotation be used; otherwise, the voltage is reversed.  

The speed of an aircraft engine varies from idle rpm to takeoff  rpm; however, during the major portion of a flight, it is at a  constant cruising speed. The generator drive is usually geared  to revolve the generator between  $1\%$   and  $1\%$   times the engine  crankshaft speed. Most aircraft generators have a speed at  

![](images/3b83e8c456e1c1039021c4fbaf57402dec2bb36ef9194ea1bdea50b7f23044b6.jpg)  
Figure 12-285.   Diagram and schematic of a series wound generator.  

which they begin to produce their normal voltage. Termed  the “coming in” speed, it is usually about   $1{,}500\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

# Generator Terminals  

On most large 24-volt generators, electrical connections  are made to terminals marked B, A, and E. The positive  armature lead in the generator connects to the B terminal.  The negative armature lead connects to the E terminal. The  positive end of the shunt field winding connects to terminal A,  and the opposite end connects to the negative terminal brush.  Terminal A receives current from the negative generator brush  through the shunt field winding. This current passes through  the voltage regulator and back to the armature through the  positive brush. Load current, which leaves the armature  through the negative brushes, comes out of the E lead and  passes through the load before returning to the armature  through the positive brushes.  

# DC Generator Maintenance  

# Inspection  

The following information about the inspection and  maintenance of DC generator systems is general in nature  because of the large number of differing aircraft generator  systems. These procedures are for familiarization only.  Always follow the applicable manufacturer’s instructions  for a given generator system.  

![](images/41096d939b87404b2326498f4fa853e133be649323095059e21918f0e9549c03.jpg)  
Figure 12-286.   Shunt wound generator.  

In general, the inspection of the generator installed in the  aircraft should include the following items:  

1.	 Security of generator mounting 2.	 Condition of electrical connections 3.	 Dirt and oil in the generator—if oil is present, check  engine oil seal. Blow out dirt with compressed air. 4.	 Condition of generator brushes 5.	 Generator operation 6.	 Voltage regulator operation  

# Condition of Generator Brushes  

Sparking of brushes quickly reduces the effective brush area  in contact with the commutator bars. The degree of such  sparking should be determined. Excessive wear warrants a  detailed inspection.  

The following information pertains to brush seating, brush  pressure, high mica condition, and brush wear. Manufacturers  usually recommend the following procedures to seat brushes  that do not make good contact with slip rings or commutators.  

Lift the brush sufficiently to permit the insertion of a strip  of No. 000, or finer, sandpaper under the brush, rough side  out.  [Figure 12-289]  Pull the sandpaper in the direction  of armature rotation, being careful to keep the ends of the  sandpaper as close to the slip ring or commutator surface as  possible in order to avoid rounding the edges of the brush.  

When pulling the sandpaper back to the starting point, raise  the brush so it does not ride on the sandpaper. Sand the brush  only in the direction of rotation.  

After the generator has run for a short period, brushes should  be inspected to make sure that pieces of sand have not become  embedded in the brush and are collecting copper.  

Under no circumstances should emery cloth or similar  abrasives be used for seating brushes (or smoothing  commutators), since they contain conductive materials that  cause arcing between brushes and commutator bars.  

Excessive pressure causes rapid wear of brushes. Too  little pressure, however, allows “bouncing” of the brushes,  resulting in burned and pitted surfaces.  

A carbon, graphite, or light metalized brush should exert a  pressure of   $1\%$   to   $2\%$   psi on the commutator. The pressure  recommended by the manufacturer should be checked by  the use of a spring scale graduated in ounces. Brush spring  

![](images/1766505b2f32694e08bcc317a226bb4463257e153d428439c406fe61d081a9d4.jpg)  
Figure 12-287.   Compound wound generator.  

tension is usually adjusted between 32 to 36 ounces; however,  the tension may differ slightly for each specific generator.  

When a spring scale is used, the measurement of the pressure  that a brush exerts on the commutator is read directly on the  scale. The scale is applied at the point of contact between the  spring arm and the top of the brush, with the brush installed  in the guide. The scale is drawn up until the arm just lifts  off the brush surface. At this instant, the force on the scale  should be read.  

Flexible low resistance pigtails are provided on most heavy  current carrying brushes, and their connections should be  securely made and checked at frequent intervals. The pigtails  should never be permitted to alter or restrict the free motion  of the brush.  

The purpose of the pigtail is to conduct the current, rather  than subjecting the brush spring to currents that would alter  its spring action by overheating. The pigtails also eliminate  any possible sparking to the brush guides caused by the  movement of the brushes within the holder, thus minimizing  side wear of the brush.  

Carbon dust resulting from brush sanding should be  thoroughly cleaned from all parts of the generators after a  sanding operation. Such carbon dust has been the cause of  several serious fires, as well as costly damage to the generator.  

Operation over extended periods of time often results in  the mica insulation between commutator bars protruding  above the surface of the bars. This condition is called “high  mica” and interferes with the contact of the brushes to  

![](images/0c6a99ec49fe34475fcb0a52a4860f95b16e078ff8346220e43cb2dc2296291c.jpg)  
Figure 12-288.   Generator characteristics.  

armature has been turned on a lathe, carefully undercut the  mica insulation to a depth equal to the width of the mica, or  approximately 1.20 inch.  

Each brush should be a specified length to work properly.  If a brush is too short, the contact it makes with the  commutator will be faulty, which can also reduce the spring  force holding the brush in place. Most manufacturers specify  the amount of wear permissible from a new brush length.  When a brush has worn to the minimum length permissible,  it must be replaced.  

Some special generator brushes should not be replaced  because of a slight grooving on the face of the brush. These  grooves are normal and will appear in AC and DC generator  brushes which are installed in some models of aircraft  generators. These brushes have two cores made of a harder  material with a higher expansion rate than the material used  in the main body of the brush. Usually, the main body of  the brush face rides on the commutator. However, at certain  temperatures, the cores extend and wear through any film  on the commutator.  

# DC Motors  

Most devices in an airplane, from the starter  [Figure 12-290] to the automatic pilot, depend upon mechanical energy  furnished by DC motors. A DC motor is a rotating machine,  which transforms DC energy into mechanical energy. It  consists of two principal parts—a field assembly and an  armature assembly. The armature is the rotating part in which  current carrying wires are acted upon by the magnetic field.  

Whenever a current carrying wire is placed in the field of  a magnet, a force acts on the wire. The force is not one of  attraction or repulsion; however, it is at right angles to the  wire and also at right angles to the magnetic field set up by  the magnet. The action of the force upon a current carrying  wire placed in a magnetic field is shown in  Figure 12-291 A wire is located between two permanent magnets. The lines  of force in the magnetic field are from the North pole to the  South pole. When no current flows, no force is exerted on the  wire, but when current flows through the wire, a magnetic  field is set up about it.  [Figure 12-291]  The direction of the  field depends on the direction of current flow. Current in one  direction creates a clockwise field about the wire, and current  in the other direction, a counterclockwise field.  

Since the current carrying wire produces a magnetic field,  a reaction occurs between the field about the wire and the  magnetic field between the magnets. When the current flows  in a direction to create a counterclockwise magnetic field  about the wire, this field and the field between the magnets  add or reinforce at the bottom of the wire because the lines  of force are in the same direction. At the top of the wire,  they subtract or neutralize, since the lines of force in the two  fields are opposite in direction. Thus, the resulting field at the  bottom is strong and the one at the top is weak. Consequently,  the wire is pushed upward.  [Figure 12-291C]  The wire is  always pushed away from the side where the field is strongest. If current flow through the wire were reversed in direction,  the two fields would add at the top and subtract at the bottom.  Since a wire is always pushed away from the strong field,  the wire would be pushed down.  

# Force Between Parallel Conductors  

Two wires carrying current in the vicinity of one another exert  a force on each other because of their magnetic fields. An  end view of two conductors is shown in  Figure 12-292 . In  Figure 12-292A , electron flow in both conductors is toward  the reader, and the magnetic fields are clockwise around the  conductors. Between the wires, the fields cancel because the  directions of the two fields oppose each other. The wires are  forced in the direction of the weaker field, toward each other.  This force is one of attraction. In  Figure 12-292B , the electron  flow in the two wires is in opposite directions.  

The magnetic fields are, therefore, clockwise in one and  

![](images/ee6c40a2641375ff14905c83f33b6aba6a3198ff702c7f8b358cc73a0be3a343.jpg)  
Figure 12-289.   Seating brushes with sandpaper.  

counterclockwise in the other, as shown. The fields reinforce  each other between the wires, and the wires are forced in the  direction of the weaker field, away from each other. This  force is one of repulsion.  

To summarize: conductors carrying current in the same  direction tend to be drawn together; conductors carrying current  in opposite directions tend to be repelled from each other.  

# Developing Torque  

If a coil in which current is flowing is placed in a magnetic  field, a force is produced which causes the coil to rotate. In  the coil shown in  Figure 12-293 , current flows inward on  side A and outward on side B. The magnetic field about B is  clockwise and that about A, counterclockwise. As previously  explained, a force develops which pushes side B downward.  At the same time, the field of the magnets and the field  about A, in which the current is inward, adds at the bottom  and subtracts at the top. Therefore, A moves upward. The  coil rotates until its plane is perpendicular to the magnetic  lines between the North and South poles of the magnet, as  indicated in  Figure 12-293  by the white coil at right angles  to the black coil.  

The tendency of a force to produce rotation is called torque.  When the steering wheel of a car is turned, torque is applied.  The engine of an airplane gives torque to the propeller. Torque  is developed also by the reacting magnetic fields about the  current carrying coil just described. This is the torque, which  turns the coil.  

The right-hand motor rule can be used to determine the  direction a current carrying wire moves in a magnetic field.  As illustrated in  Figure 12-294 , if the index finger of the  right hand is pointed in the direction of the magnetic field  and the second finger in the direction of current flow, the  thumb indicates the direction the current carrying wire moves. The amount of torque developed in a coil depends upon several  factors: the strength of the magnetic field, the number of turns  in the coil, and the position of the coil in the field. Magnets are  made of special steel that produces a strong field. Since there  is torque acting on each turn, the greater the number of turns  on the coil, the greater the torque. In a coil carrying a steady  current located in a uniform magnetic field, the torque varies  at successive positions of rotation.  [Figure 12-295]  When the  plane of the coil is parallel to the lines of force, the torque is  zero. When its plane cuts the lines of force at right angles, the  torque is 100 percent. At intermediate positions, the torque  ranges between 0 and 100 percent.  

# Basic DC Motor  

A coil of wire through which the current flows rotates when  placed in a magnetic field. This is the technical basis governing  the construction of a DC motor.  [Figure 12-296]  However,  if the connecting wires from the battery were permanently  fastened to the terminals of the coil and there was a flow of  current, the coil would rotate only until it lined itself up with  the magnetic field. Then, it would stop, because the torque  at that point would be 0.  

A motor, of course, must continue rotating. It is therefore  necessary to design a device that reverses the current in the  coil just at the time the coil becomes parallel to the lines of  force. This creates torque again and causes the coil to rotate.  If the current reversing device is set up to reverse the current  each time the coil is about to stop, the coil can be made to  continue rotating as long as desired.  

One method of doing this is to connect the circuit so that, as  the coil rotates, each contact slides off the terminal to which it  connects and slides onto the terminal of opposite polarity. In  other words, the coil contacts switch terminals continuously  as the coil rotates, preserving the torque and keeping the  coil rotating. In  Figure 12-296 , the coil terminal segments  are labeled A and B. As the coil rotates, the segments slide  onto and past the fixed terminals or brushes. With this  arrangement, the direction of current in the side of the coil  next to the North-seeking pole flows toward the reader, and  the force acting on that side of the coil turns it downward.  The part of the motor that changes the current from one wire  to another is called the commutator.  

# Position A  

When the coil is positioned as shown in  Figure 12-296A ,  current flows from the negative terminal of the battery to the  negative  $(-)$   brush, to segment B of the commutator, through  the loop to segment A of the commutator, to the positive  $(+)$  brush, and then back to the positive terminal of the battery.  By using the right-hand motor rule, it is seen that the coil  rotates counterclockwise. The torque at this position of the  coil is maximum, since the greatest number of lines of force  is being cut by the coil.  

![](images/40d35033659fcf1376326a9e8eec571507a92dffab3f2fb531e4497ef7b3e390.jpg)  
Figure 12-290.   DC series starter motor.  

# Position B  

When the coil has rotated   $90°$   to the position shown  in  Figure 12-296B , segments A and B of the commutator no  longer make contact with the battery circuit and no current  can flow through the coil. At this position, the torque has  reached a minimum value, since a minimum number of lines  of force are being cut. However, the momentum of the coil  carries it beyond this position until the segments again make  contact with the brushes, and current again enters the coil;  this time, though, it enters through segment A and leaves  through segment B. However, since the positions of segments  A and B have also been reversed, the effect of the current is  as before, the torque acts in the same direction, and the coil  continues its counterclockwise rotation.  

# Position C  

On passing through the position shown in  Figure 12-296C the torque again reaches maximum.  

# Position D  

Continued rotation carries the coil again to a position of  minimum torque as in  Figure 12-296D . At this position, the  brushes no longer carry current, but once more the momentum  rotates the coil to the point where current enters through  

![](images/ca4e2b33a56296ff199783b90c767addf4135d2b700f3aed3254c297e8c80229.jpg)  
Figure 12-291.   Force on a current carrying wire.  

segment B and leaves through A. Further rotation brings the  coil to the starting point and, thus, one revolution is completed.  

The switching of the coil terminals from the positive to the  negative brushes occurs twice per revolution of the coil.  

The torque in a motor containing only a single coil is neither  continuous nor very effective, for there are two positions  where there is actually no torque at all. To overcome this, a  practical DC motor contains a large number of coils wound on  the armature. These coils are so spaced that, for any position  of the armature, there are coils near the poles of the magnet.  This makes the torque both continuous and strong. The  commutator, likewise, contains a large number of segments  instead of only two.  

The armature in a practical motor is not placed between  the poles of a permanent magnet but between those of an  electromagnet, since a much stronger magnetic field can be  furnished. The core is usually made of a mild or annealed  steel, which can be magnetized strongly by induction. The  current magnetizing the electromagnet is from the same  source that supplies the current to the armature.

Figure 12-292.   Fields surrounding parallel conductors.  

# DC Motor Construction  

The major parts in a practical motor are the armature  assembly, the field assembly, the brush assembly, and the  end frame.  [Figure 12-297]  

# Armature Assembly  

The armature assembly contains a laminated, soft-iron core,  coils, and a commutator, all mounted on a rotatable steel shaft.  Laminations made of stacks of soft iron, insulated from each  other, form the armature core. Solid iron is not used, since a  solid iron core revolving in the magnetic field would heat and  use energy needlessly. The armature windings are insulated  copper wire, which are inserted in slots insulated with fiber  paper (fish paper) to protect the windings. The ends of the  windings are connected to the commutator segments. Wedges  or steel bands hold the windings in place to prevent them  from flying out of the slots when the armature is rotating at  high speeds. The commutator consists of a large number of  copper segments insulated from each other and the armature  shaft by pieces of mica. Insulated wedge rings hold the  segments in place.  

![](images/61a24686d500fb4ef7d656437fa79fe7500035e86db18f379b038ce07a1ec4ad.jpg)  
Figure 12-294.   Right-hand motor rule.  

# Field Assembly  

The field assembly consists of the field frame, the pole pieces,  and the field coils. The field frame is located along the inner  wall of the motor housing. It contains laminated, soft-steel pole  pieces on which the field coils are wound. A coil, consisting of  several turns of insulated wire, fits over each pole piece and,  together with the pole, constitutes a field pole. Some motors  have as few as two poles, others as many as eight.  

# Brush Assembly  

The brush assembly consists of the brushes and their holders.  The brushes are usually small blocks of graphitic carbon, since  this material has a long service life and also causes minimum  wear to the commutator. The holders permit some play in the  brushes so they can follow any irregularities in the surface  of the commutator and make good contact. Springs hold the  brushes firmly against the commutator.  [Figure 12-298]  

# End Frame  

The end frame is the part of the motor opposite the  commutator. Usually, the end frame is designed so that it  can be connected to the unit to be driven. The bearing for the  drive end is also located in the end frame. Sometimes the end  frame is made a part of the unit driven by the motor. When  this is done, the bearing on the drive end may be located in  any one of a number of places.  

# Types of DC Motors  

There are three basic types of DC motors: series motors, shunt  motors, and compound motors. They differ largely in the  method in which their field and armature coils are connected.  

# Series DC Motor  

In the series motor, the field windings, consisting of a  relatively few turns of heavy wire, are connected in series  with the armature winding. Both a diagrammatic and a  schematic illustration of a series motor are shown in  Figure 12-299 . The same current flowing through the field  winding also flows through the armature winding. Any  increase in current, therefore, strengthens the magnetism of  

![](images/1c0e79bc367cf078c73c19178fb55850e60ee7f666d6ebb8932d1a11820991e9.jpg)

Figure 12-296.   Basic  $D C$   motor operation.  

Because of the low resistance in the windings, the series  motor is able to draw a large current in starting. This starting  current, in passing through both the field and armature  windings, produces a high starting torque, which is the series  motor’s principal advantage.  

The speed of a series motor is dependent upon the load. Any  change in load is accompanied by a substantial change in  speed. A series motor runs at high speed when it has a light  load and at low speed with a heavy load. If the load is removed  entirely, the motor may operate at such a high speed that the  armature falls apart. If high starting torque is needed under  heavy load conditions, series motors have many applications.  Series motors are often used in aircraft as engine starters and for  raising and lowering landing gears, cowl flaps, and wing flaps.  

# Shunt DC Motor  

In the shunt motor, the field winding is connected in parallel  or in shunt with the armature winding.  [Figure 12-300]  The  resistance in the field winding is high. Since the field winding  is connected directly across the power supply, the current  through the field is constant. The field current does not vary  with motor speed, as in the series motor and, therefore, the  torque of the shunt motor varies only with the current through  the armature. The torque developed at starting is less than  that developed by a series motor of equal size.  

The speed of the shunt motor varies very little with changes  in load. When all load is removed, it assumes a speed slightly  higher than the loaded speed. This motor is particularly  suitable for use when constant speed is desired and when  high starting torque is not needed.  

# Compound DC Motor  

The compound motor is a combination of the series and shunt  motors. There are two windings in the field: a shunt winding  and a series winding.  [Figure 12-301]  The shunt winding  is composed of many turns of fine wire and is connected in  parallel with the armature winding. The series winding  consists of a few turns of large wire and is connected in series  with the armature winding. The starting torque is higher than  in the shunt motor but lower than in the series motor. Variation  of speed with load is less than in a series wound motor but  greater than in a shunt motor. The compound motor is used  whenever the combined characteristics of the series and shunt  motors are desired.  

Like the compound generator, the compound motor has both  series and shunt field windings. The series winding may  either aid the shunt wind (cumulative compound) or oppose  the shunt winding (differential compound). The starting  and load characteristics of the cumulative compound motor  are somewhere between those of the series and those of the  shunt motor.  

Because of the series field, the cumulative compound motor  has a higher starting torque than a shunt motor. Cumulative  compound motors are used in driving machines, which are  subject to sudden changes in load. They are also used where a  high starting torque is desired, but a series motor cannot be  used easily.  

In the differential compound motor, an increase in load  creates an increase in current and a decrease in total flux in  this type of motor. These two tend to offset each other and  the result is a practically constant speed. However, since an  increase in load tends to decrease the field strength, the speed  characteristic becomes unstable. Rarely is this type of motor  used in aircraft systems.  

A graph of the variation in speed with changes of load of  the various types of DC motors is shown in  Figure 12-302 .  

# Counter Electromotive Force (emf)  

The armature resistance of a small, 28-volt DC motor  is extremely low, about 0.1 ohm. When the armature is  connected across the 28-volt source, current through the  armature is apparently:  

$$
\mathrm{I}={\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}}}={\frac{28}{0.1}}=280{\mathrm{~ampere}}
$$  

This high value of current flow is not only impracticable but  also unreasonable, especially when the current drain, during  normal operation of a motor, is found to be about 4 amperes.  This is because the current through a motor armature during  operation is determined by more factors than ohmic resistance.  

When the armature in a motor rotates in a magnetic field, a  voltage is induced in its windings. This voltage is called the  back or counter emf and is opposite in direction to the voltage  applied to the motor from the external source.  

Counter emf opposes the current, which causes the armature  to rotate. The current flowing through the armature, therefore,  decreases as the counter emf increases. The faster the  armature rotates, the greater the counter emf. For this reason,  a motor connected to a battery may draw a fairly high current  on starting, but as the armature speed increases, the current  flowing through the armature decreases. At rated speed, the  counter emf may be only a few volts less than the battery  voltage. Then, if the load on the motor is increased, the motor  slows down, less counter emf is generated, and the current  drawn from the external source increases. In a shunt motor,  the counter emf affects only the current in the armature, since  

![](images/b552df6577501d970af1595f76aaac9782f7548553b76def76c6df89c097bdca.jpg)  
Figure 12-297.   Cutaway view of practical DC motor.  

the field is connected in parallel across the power source. As  the motor slows down and the counter emf decreases, more  current flows through the armature, but the magnetism in the  field is unchanged. When the series motor slows down, the  counter EMF decreases and more current flows through the  field and the armature, thereby strengthening their magnetic  fields. Because of these characteristics, it is more difficult to  stall a series motor than a shunt motor.  

# Types of Duty  

Electric motors are called upon to operate under various  conditions. Some motors are used for intermittent operation;  

![](images/fab472030d0428a593cd9e7f0dcb3780d2dd268bfed92440ce453ca8bfd4bb2f.jpg)  
Figure 12-298.   Commutator and brushes.  

others operate continuously. Motors built for intermittent  duty can be operated for short periods only and, then, must  be allowed to cool before being operated again. If such a  motor is operated for long periods under full load, the motor  becomes overheated. Motors built for continuous duty may  be operated at rated power for long periods.  

# Reversing Motor Direction  

By reversing the direction of current flow in either the armature  or the field windings, the direction of a motor’s rotation may be  reversed. This reverses the magnetism of either the armature or  the magnetic field in which the armature rotates. If the wires  connecting the motor to an external source are interchanged,  the direction of rotation is not reversed, since changing these  wires reverses the magnetism of both field and armature and  leaves the torque in the same direction as before.  

One method for reversing direction of rotation employs  two field windings wound in opposite directions on the  same pole. This type of motor is called a split field motor.  [Figure 12-303]  The single pole, double throw switch  makes it possible to direct current through either of the two  windings. When the switch is placed in the lower position,  current flows through the lower field winding, creating  

![](images/a448994bde4e4340f08abbb1131d5888a804cac6816c2efc3e2cf3beb9c8faea.jpg)  
Figure 12-299.   Series motor.  

a North pole at the lower field winding and at the lower  pole piece, and a South pole at the upper pole piece. When  the switch is placed in the upper position, current flows  through the upper field winding, the magnetism of the  field is reversed, and the armature rotates in the opposite  direction. Some split field motors are built with two separate  field windings wound on alternate poles. The armature in  such a motor, a four pole reversible motor, rotates in one  direction when current flows through the windings of one set  of opposite pole pieces, and in the opposite direction when  current flows through the other set of windings.  

Another method of direction reversal, called the switch  method, employs a double pole, double throw switch which  changes the direction of current flow in either the armature  or the field. In the illustration of the switch method shown in  Figure 12-304 , current direction may be reversed through the  field but not through the armature. When the switch is thrown  to the “up” position, current flows through the field winding  to establish a North pole at the right side of the motor and a  South pole at the left side of the motor. When the switch is  thrown to the “down” position, this polarity is reversed and  the armature rotates in the opposite direction.

Figure 12-300.   Shunt motor.  

# Motor Speed  

Motor speed can be controlled by varying the current in the  field windings. When the amount of current flowing through  the field windings is increased, the field strength increases,  but the motor slows down since a greater amount of counter  EMF is generated in the armature windings. When the field  current is decreased, the field strength decreases, and the  motor speeds up because the counter EMF is reduced. A  motor in which speed can be controlled is called a variable  speed motor. It may be either a shunt or series motor.  

In the shunt motor, speed is controlled by a rheostat in series  with the field windings.  [Figure 12-305]  The speed depends  on the amount of current that flows through the rheostat to the  field windings. To increase the motor speed, the resistance in  the rheostat is increased, which decreases the field current.  As a result, there is a decrease in the strength of the magnetic  field and in the counter EMF. This momentarily increases the  armature current and the torque. The motor then automatically  speeds up until the counter EMF increases and causes the  armature current to decrease to its former value. When this  occurs, the motor operates at a higher fixed speed than before.  

To decrease the motor speed, the resistance of the rheostat  is decreased. More current flows through the field windings  and increases the strength of the field; then, the counter EMF  increases momentarily and decreases the armature current.  As a result, the torque decreases and the motor slows down  until the counter EMF decreases to its former value; then the  motor operates at a lower fixed speed than before.  

In the series motor, the rheostat speed control is connected  either in parallel or in series with the motor field, or in  parallel with the armature. When the rheostat is set for  maximum resistance, the motor speed is increased in the  parallel armature connection by a decrease in current. When  the rheostat resistance is maximum in the series connection,  motor speed is reduced by a reduction in voltage across the  motor. For above normal speed operation, the rheostat is in

is bypassed and the motor speeds up.  [Figure 12-306]  

# Energy Losses in DC Motors  

Losses occur when electrical energy is converted to  mechanical energy (in the motor), or mechanical energy  is converted to electrical energy (in the generator). For  the machine to be efficient, these losses must be kept to a  minimum. Some losses are electrical; others are mechanical.  Electrical losses are classified as copper losses and iron  losses; mechanical losses occur in overcoming the friction  of various parts of the machine.  

Copper losses occur when electrons are forced through  the copper windings of the armature and the field. These  losses are proportional to the square of the current. They are  sometimes called  $\mathrm{I}^{2}\mathrm{R}$   losses, since they are due to the power  dissipated in the form of heat in the resistance of the field  and armature windings.  

Iron losses are subdivided in hysteresis and eddy current  losses. Hysteresis losses are caused by the armature revolving  in an alternating magnetic field. It, therefore, becomes  magnetized first in one direction and then in the other. The  residual magnetism of the iron or steel of which the armature  is made causes these losses. Since the field magnets are  always magnetized in one direction (DC field), they have  no hysteresis losses.  

Eddy current losses occur because the iron core of the  armature is a conductor revolving in a magnetic field. This  sets up an EMF across portions of the core, causing currents  to flow within the core. These currents heat the core and, if  they become excessive, may damage the windings. As far as  the output is concerned, the power consumed by eddy currents  is a loss. To reduce eddy currents to a minimum, a laminated  core usually is used. A laminated core is made of thin sheets  of iron electrically insulated from each other. The insulation  between laminations reduces eddy currents, because it is  “transverse” to the direction in which these currents tend to  flow. However, it has no effect on the magnetic circuit. The  thinner the laminations, the more effectively this method  reduces eddy current losses.  

# Inspection and Maintenance of DC Motors  

Use the following procedures to make inspection and  maintenance checks:  

1.	 Check the operation of the unit driven by the motor  in accordance with the instructions covering the  specific installation. 2.	 Check all wiring, connections, terminals, fuses, and  switches for general condition and security. 3.	 Keep motors clean and mounting bolts tight. 4.	 Check brushes for condition, length, and spring  tension. Minimum brush lengths, correct spring  tension, and procedures for replacing brushes are  given in the applicable manufacturer’s instructions. 5.	 Inspect commutator for cleanness, pitting, scoring,  roughness, corrosion, or burning. Check for high  mica (IF the copper wears down below the mica, the  mica insulates the brushes from the commutator.)  Clean dirty commutators with a cloth moistened with  the recommended cleaning solvent. Polish rough  or corroded commutators with fine sandpaper (000  or finer) and blow out with compressed air. Never  use emery paper since it contains metallic particles  

![](images/b07844072c27568f59b9ead772b179c2af982d92344fb18aabb75f8d4a7975b7.jpg)  
Figure 12-303.   Split field series motor.  

that may cause shorts. Replace the motor if the  commutator is burned, badly pitted, grooved, or worn  to the extent that the mica insulation is flush with the  commutator surface.  

6.	 Inspect all exposed wiring for evidence of overheating.  Replace the motor if the insulation on leads or  windings is burned, cracked, or brittle. 7.	 Lubricate only if called for by the manufacturer’s  instructions covering the motor. Most motors used  in today’s airplanes require no lubrication between  overhauls. 8.	 Adjust and lubricate the gearbox, or unit which the  motor drives, in accordance with the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions covering the unit.  

When trouble develops in a DC motor system, check first to  determine the source of the trouble. Replace the motor only  when the trouble is due to a defect in the motor itself. In most  cases, the failure of a motor to operate is caused by a defect  in the external electrical circuit or by mechanical failure in  the mechanism driven by the motor.  

Check the external electrical circuit for loose or dirty  

![](images/c03bca38f16ba4d32eda883c69ab789bbbde0ef11c5a8a79cfccdbf2eb36d3c5.jpg)

connections and for improper connection of wiring. Look  for open circuits, grounds, and shorts by following the  applicable manufacturer’s circuit testing procedure. If the  fuse is not blown, failure of the motor to operate is usually  due to an open circuit. A blown fuse usually indicates an  accidental ground or short circuit. A low battery usually  causes the chattering of the relay switch, which controls the  motor. When the battery is low, the open circuit voltage of  the battery is sufficient to close the relay, but with the heavy  current draw of the motor, the voltage drops below the level  required to hold the relay closed. When the relay opens, the  voltage in the battery increases enough to close the relay  again. This cycle repeats and causes chattering, which is very  harmful to the relay switch due to the heavy current causing  an arc which burns the contacts.  

Check the unit driven by the motor for failure of the unit  or drive mechanism. If the motor has failed as a result of a  failure in the driven unit, the fault must be corrected before  installing a new motor. If it has been determined that the  fault is in the motor itself (by checking for correct voltage  at the motor terminals and for failure of the driven unit),  inspect the commutator and brushes. A dirty commutator  or defective or binding brushes may result in poor contact  between brushes and commutator. Clean the commutator,  brushes, and brush holders with a cloth moistened with the  recommended cleaning solvent. If brushes are damaged or  worn to the specified minimum length, install new brushes in  

![](images/5c10a44cf58e75cf6a3ff628f17e00b2b09ce69b3f364056c92ee78c64938d3a.jpg)

accordance with the applicable manufacturer’s instructions  covering the motor. If the motor still fails to operate, replace  it with a serviceable motor.  

# AC Motors  

Because of their advantages, many types of aircraft motors  are designed to operate on alternating current. In general,  AC motors are less expensive than comparable DC motors.  In many instances, AC motors do not use brushes and  commutators so sparking at the brushes is avoided. AC  motors are reliable and require little maintenance. They are  also well suited for constant speed applications and certain  types are manufactured that have, within limits, variable  speed characteristics. Alternating current motors are designed  to operate on polyphase or single-phase lines and at several  voltage ratings.  

The speed of rotation of an AC motor depends upon the number  of poles and the frequency of the electrical source of power:  

$$
\mathrm{rpm}={\frac{120\times\mathrm{Fractional}}{\mathrm{Number~of~poles}}}
$$  

Since airplane electrical systems typically operate at 400  cycles, an electric motor at this frequency operates at about  seven times the speed of a 60-cycle commercial motor with  the same number of poles. Because of this high speed of  rotation, 400-cycle AC motors are suitable for operating  small, high-speed rotors, through reduction gears, in  lifting and moving heavy loads, such as the wing flaps, the  retractable landing gear, and the starting of engines. The  400-cycle induction type motor operates at speeds ranging  from   $6{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$   to  $24{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  . Alternating current motors  are rated in horsepower output, operating voltage, full load  current, speed, number of phases, and frequency. Whether  the motors operate continuously or intermittently (for short  intervals) is also considered in the rating.  

# Types of AC Motors  

There are two general types of AC motors used in aircraft  systems: induction motors and synchronous motors. Either type  may be single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase. Three-phase  induction motors are used where large amounts of power are  required. They operate such devices as starters, flaps, landing  gears, and hydraulic pumps. Single-phase induction motors  are used to operate devices such as surface locks, intercooler  shutters, and oil shutoff valves in which the power requirement  is low. Three-phase synchronous motors operate at constant  synchronous speeds and are commonly used to operate flux  gate compasses and propeller synchronizer systems. Single- phase synchronous motors are common sources of power to  operate electric clocks and other small, precision equipment.  They require some auxiliary method to bring them up to  

![](images/6b79eac6d8169402c82df9886668322ff8f2ac5eb4013b3704a439457e33d94b.jpg)  
Figure 12-306.   Controlling the speed of a series DC motor.  

synchronous speeds; that is, to start them. Usually the starting  winding consists of an auxiliary stator winding.  

# Three-Phase Induction Motor  

The three-phase AC induction motor is also called a squirrel  cage motor. Both single-phase and three-phase motors  operate on the principle of a rotating magnetic field. A  horseshoe magnet held over a compass needle is a simple  illustration of the principle of the rotating field. The needle  takes a position parallel to the magnetic flux passing between  the two poles of the magnet. If the magnet is rotated, the  compass needle follows. A rotating magnetic field can be  produced by a two-or three-phase current flowing through  two or more groups of coils wound on inwardly projecting  poles of an iron frame. The coils on each group of poles  are wound alternately in opposite directions to produce  opposite polarity, and each group is connected to a separate  phase of voltage. The operating principle depends on a  revolving, or rotating, magnetic field to produce torque.  The key to understanding the induction motor is a thorough  understanding of the rotating magnetic field.  

# Rotating Magnetic Field  

The field structure shown in  Figure 12-307A  has poles  whose windings are energized by three AC voltages: a, b,  and c. These voltages have equal magnitude but differ in  phase.  [Figure 12-307B]  At the instant of time shown as  0, the resultant magnetic field produced by the application  of the three voltages has its greatest intensity in a direction  extending from pole 1 to pole 4. Under this condition, pole  1 can be considered as a North pole and pole 4 as a South  pole. At the instant of time shown as 1, the resultant magnetic  field has its greatest intensity in the direction extending from  pole 2 to pole 5. In this case, pole 2 can be considered as a  North pole and pole 5 as a South pole. Thus, between instant  0 and instant 1, the magnetic field has rotated clockwise. At  instant 2, the resultant magnetic field has its greatest intensity  in the direction from pole 3 to pole 6, and the resultant  magnetic field has continued to rotate clockwise. At instant  3, poles 4 and 1 can be considered as North and South poles,  respectively, and the field has rotated still farther. At later  instants of time, the resultant magnetic field rotates to other  positions while traveling in a clockwise direction, a single  revolution of the field occurring in one cycle. If the exciting  voltages have a frequency of 60 cps, the magnetic field makes  60 revolutions per second, or  $3{,}600\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . This speed is known  as the synchronous speed of the rotating field.  

# Construction of Induction Motor  

The stationary portion of an induction motor is called a stator,  and the rotating member is called a rotor. Instead of salient  poles in the stator, as shown in  Figure 12-307A , distributed  windings are used. These windings are placed in slots  around the periphery of the stator. It is usually impossible  to determine the number of poles in an induction motor by  visual inspection, but the information can be obtained from  the nameplate of the motor. The nameplate usually gives the  number of poles and the speed at which the motor is designed  to run. This rated, or nonsynchronous, speed is slightly less  than the synchronous speed. To determine the number of  poles per phase on the motor, divide 120 times the frequency  by the rated speed. Written as an equation, it is:  

$$
\mathbf{P}=\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~\frac~{~120~\times~f~}~{~N~}~}~}
$$  

Where:	   $\mathrm{P}$   is the number of poles per phase  

f is the frequency in cps  $_\mathrm{N}$   is the rated speed in rpm, and  120 is a constant  

The result is nearly equal to the number of poles per phase.  For example, consider a 60-cycle, three-phase motor with a  rated speed of  $1{,}750\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . In this case:  

$$
\mathbf{P}=\frac{120\times60}{1,750}\!=\!\frac{7,\!200}{1,\!750}\!=\!4.1
$$  

Therefore, the motor has four poles per phase. If the number  of poles per phase is given on the nameplate, the synchronous  speed can be determined by dividing 120 times the frequency  by the number of poles per phase. In the example used above,  the synchronous speed is equal to  $7{,}200/4$  , or   $1{,}800\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

The rotor of an induction motor consists of an iron core  having longitudinal slots around its circumference in which  heavy copper or aluminum bars are embedded. These bars  are welded to a heavy ring of high conductivity on either  end. The composite structure is sometimes called a squirrel  cage, and motors containing such a rotor are called squirrel  cage induction motors.  [Figure 12-308]  

# Induction Motor Slip  

When the rotor of an induction motor is subjected to the  revolving magnetic field produced by the stator windings,  a voltage is induced in the longitudinal bars. The induced  voltage causes a current to flow through the bars. This current,  in turn, produces its own magnetic field, which combines  with the revolving field so that the rotor assumes a position in  which the induced voltage is minimized. As a result, the rotor  revolves at very nearly the synchronous speed of the stator  field, the difference in speed being just sufficient enough to  induce the proper amount of current in the rotor to overcome  the mechanical and electrical losses in the rotor. If the rotor  were to turn at the same speed as the rotating field, the rotor  conductors would not be cut by any magnetic lines of force,  no EMF would be induced in them, no current could flow, and  there would be no torque. The rotor would then slow down.  For this reason, there must always be a difference in speed  between the rotor and the rotating field. This difference in  speed is called slip and is expressed as a percentage of the  synchronous speed. For example, if the rotor turns at  $1{,}750\,\mathrm{rpm}$  and the synchronous speed is  $1{,}800\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , the difference in speed  is   $50\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . The slip is then equal to 50/1,800 or 2.78 percent.  

# Single-Phase Induction Motor  

The previous discussion has applied only to polyphase  motors. A single-phase motor has only one stator winding.  This winding generates a field, which merely pulsates, instead  of rotating. When the rotor is stationary, the expanding and  collapsing stator field induces currents in the rotor. These  currents generate a rotor field opposite in polarity to that of  the stator. The opposition of the field exerts a turning force  on the upper and lower parts of the rotor trying to turn it  $180^{\circ}$  from its position. Since these forces are exerted through the  center of the rotor, the turning force is equal in each direction.  As a result, the rotor does not turn. If the rotor starts turning,  it continues to rotate in the direction in which it started, since  the turning force in that direction is aided by the momentum  of the rotor.  

# Shaded Pole Induction Motor  

The first effort in the development of a self-starting,  single-phase motor was the shaded pole induction motor.  [Figure 12-309]  This motor has salient poles, a portion  of each pole being encircled by a heavy copper ring. The  presence of the ring causes the magnetic field through the  ringed portion of the pole face to lag appreciably behind  that through the other part of the pole face. The net effect  is the production of a slight component of rotation of the  field, sufficient to cause the rotor to revolve. As the rotor  accelerates, the torque increases until the rated speed is  obtained. Such motors have low starting torque and find  their greatest application in small fan motors where the initial  torque required is low.  

In  Figure 12-309 , a diagram of a pole and the rotor is  shown. The poles of the shaded pole motor resemble those  of a DC motor.  

A low resistance, short-circuited coil or copper band is placed  across one tip of each small pole from which the motor gets  the name of shaded pole. The rotor of this motor is the squirrel  cage type. As the current increases in the stator winding, the  flux increases. A portion of this flux cuts the low resistance  shading coil. This induces a current in the shading coil, and  by Lenz’s Law, the current sets up a flux that opposes the  flux inducing the current. Hence, most of the flux passes  through the unshaded portion of the poles.  [Figure 12-310]  

When the current in the winding and the main flux reaches  a maximum, the rate of change is zero; thus, no emf is  induced in the shading coil. A little later, the shading coil  current, which causes the induced emf to lag, reaches zero,  and there is no opposing flux. Therefore, the main field flux  

![](images/2066c48581165c3413cd976b51e9fa9337b495366f6292888c9f693ac82e006b.jpg)  
Figure 12-307.   Rotating magnetic field developed by application  of three-phase voltages.  

passes through the shaded portion of the field pole. The  main field flux, which is now decreasing, induces a current  in the shading coil. This current sets up a flux that opposes  the decrease of the main field flux in the shaded portion of  the pole. The effect is to concentrate the lines of force in  the shaded portion of the pole face. In effect, the shading  coil retards, in time phase, the portion of the flux passing  through the shaded part of the pole. This lag in time phase  of the flux in the shaded tip causes the flux to produce the  effect of sweeping across the face of the pole, from left to  right in the direction of the shaded tip. This behaves like a  very weak rotating magnetic field, and sufficient torque is  produced to start a small motor. The starting torque of the  shaded pole motor is exceedingly weak, and the power factor  is low. Consequently, it is built in sizes suitable for driving  such devices as small fans.  

# Split-Phase Motor  

There are various types of self-starting motors, known as  split-phase motors. Such motors have a starting winding  displaced 90 electrical degrees from the main or running  winding. In some types, the starting winding has a fairly  high resistance, which causes the current in this winding  to be out of phase with the current in the running winding.  This condition produces, in effect, a rotating field and  the rotor revolves. A centrifugal switch disconnects the  starting winding automatically after the rotor has attained  approximately 25 percent of its rated speed.  

# Capacitor Start Motor  

With the development of high-capacity electrolytic  capacitors, a variation of the split-phase motor known as the  capacitor start motor, has been made. Nearly all fractional  horsepower motors in use today on refrigerators and other  similar appliances are of this type.  [Figure 12-311]  In this  adaptation, the starting winding and running winding have  the same size and resistance value. The phase shift between  currents of the two windings is obtained by using capacitors  connected in series with the starting winding.  

Capacitor start motors have a starting torque comparable to  their torque at rated speed and can be used in applications  where the initial load is heavy. Again, a centrifugal switch  is required for disconnecting the starting winding when the  rotor speed is approximately 25 percent of the rated speed.  

Although some single-phase induction motors are rated as  high as 2 horsepower (hp), the major field of application is  1 hp, or less, at a voltage rating of 115 volts for the smaller  sizes and 110 to 220 volts for one-fourth hp and up. For even  larger power ratings, polyphase motors generally are used,  since they have excellent starting torque characteristics.  

# Direction of Rotation of Induction Motors  

The direction of rotation of a three-phase induction motor  can be changed by simply reversing two of the leads to the  motor. The same effect can be obtained in a two-phase motor  by reversing connections to one phase. In a single-phase  motor, reversing connections to the starting winding reverses  the direction of rotation.  

Most single-phase motors designed for general application  have provision for readily reversing connections to the  starting winding. Nothing can be done to a shaded pole motor  to reverse the direction of rotation because the direction is  determined by the physical location of the copper shading  ring. If, after starting, one connection to a three-phase motor  is broken, the motor continues to run but delivers only  one-third the rated power. Also, a two-phase motor runs at  one-half its rated power if one phase is disconnected. Neither

motor starts under these abnormal conditions.  

# Synchronous Motor  

The synchronous motor is one of the principal types of AC  motors. Like the induction motor, the synchronous motor  makes use of a rotating magnetic field. Unlike the induction  motor, however, the torque developed does not depend on  the induction of currents in the rotor. Briefly, the principle of  operation of the synchronous motor is as follows: A multiphase  source of AC is applied to the stator windings, and a rotating  magnetic field is produced. A direct current is applied to the  rotor winding, and another magnetic field is produced. The  synchronous motor is so designed and constructed that these  two fields react to each other in such a manner that the rotor  is dragged along and rotates at the same speed as the rotating  magnetic field produced by the stator windings.  

An understanding of the operation of the synchronous  motor can be obtained by considering the simple motor of  Figure 12-312 . Assume that poles A and B are being rotated  clockwise by some mechanical means in order to produce  a rotating magnetic field. They induce poles of opposite  polarity in the soft iron rotor, and forces of attraction exist  between corresponding North and South poles.  

Consequently, as poles A and B rotate, the rotor is dragged  along at the same speed. However, if a load is applied to the  rotor shaft, the rotor axis momentarily falls behind that of the  rotating field but, thereafter, continues to rotate with the field  at the same speed as long as the load remains constant. If the  load is too large, the rotor pulls out of synchronism with the  rotating field and, as a result, no longer rotates with the field  at the same speed. Thus, the motor is said to be overloaded.  

Such a simple motor as shown in  Figure 12-312  is never used.  The idea of using some mechanical means of rotating the poles  

![](images/a997b8e5a8f1d270081f3082daa158c958730da0265d67a319718d226db1d63b.jpg)

is impractical because another motor would be required to  perform this work. Also, such an arrangement is unnecessary  because a rotating magnetic field can be produced electrically  by using phased AC voltages. In this respect, the synchronous  motor is similar to the induction motor.  

The synchronous motor consists of a stator field winding  similar to that of an induction motor. The stator winding  produces a rotating magnetic field. The rotor may be a  permanent magnet, as in small, single-phase synchronous  motors used for clocks and other small precision equipment,  or it may be an electromagnet, energized from a DC source of  power and fed through slip rings into the rotor field coils, as  in an alternator. In fact, an alternator may be operated either  as an alternator or a synchronous motor.  

Since a synchronous motor has little starting torque, some  means must be provided to bring it up to synchronous speed.  The most common method is to start the motor at no load,  allow it to reach full speed, and then energize the magnetic  field. The magnetic field of the rotor locks with the magnetic  field of the stator and the motor operates at synchronous speed.  

The magnitude of the induced poles in the rotor shown in  Figure 12-313  is so small that sufficient torque cannot be  developed for most practical loads. To avoid such a limitation  on motor operation, a winding is placed on the rotor and  energized with DC. A rheostat placed in series with the DC  source provides the operator of the machine with a means  of varying the strength of the rotor poles, thus placing the  motor under control for varying loads.  

The synchronous motor is not a self-starting motor. The  rotor is heavy and, from a dead stop, it is impossible to  bring the rotor into magnetic lock with the rotating magnetic  field. For this reason, all synchronous motors have some  kind of starting device. One type of simple starter is  another motor, either AC or DC, which brings the rotor up  to approximately 90 percent of its synchronous speed. The  starting motor is then disconnected, and the rotor locks in  step with the rotating field. Another starting method is a  second winding of the squirrel cage type on the rotor. This  induction winding brings the rotor almost to synchronous  speed, and when the DC is connected to the rotor windings,  the rotor pulls into step with the field. The latter method is  the more commonly used.  

# AC Series Motor  

An AC-series motor is a single-phase motor, but is not an  induction or synchronous motor. It resembles a DC motor in  

![](images/90a466443a2d0439ee7b9c90ec359616ac1b4ff95b35b52926d161a08b7df4f9.jpg)  
Figure 12-310.   Diagram of a shaded pole motor.  

that it has brushes and a commutator. The AC-series motor  operates on either AC or DC circuits. Remember that the  direction of rotation of a DC-series motor is independent  of the polarity of the applied voltage, provided the field  and armature connections remain unchanged. Hence, if a  DC-series motor is connected to an AC source, a torque is  developed that tends to rotate the armature in one direction.  However, a DC-series motor does not operate satisfactorily  from an AC supply for the following reasons:  

1.	 The alternating flux sets up large eddy current and  hysteresis losses in the unlaminated portions of the  magnetic circuit and causes excessive heating and  reduced efficiency. 2.	 The self-induction of the field and armature windings  causes a low power factor. 3.	 The alternating field flux establishes large currents in  the coils, which are short circuited by the brushes; this  action causes excessive sparking at the commutator.  

To design a series motor for satisfactory operation on AC,  the following changes are made:  

1.	 The eddy current losses are reduced by laminating the  field poles, frame, and armature. 2.	 Hysteresis losses are minimized by using high  permeability, transformer-type, silicon steel  laminations. 3.	 The reactance of the field windings is kept satisfactorily  low by using shallow pole pieces, few turns of wire,  low frequency (usually 25 cycles for large motors),  low flux density, and low reluctance (a short air gap). 4.	 The reactance of the armature is reduced by using a  compensating winding embedded in the pole pieces. If  the compensating winding is connected in series with  the armature, as shown in  Figure 12-314 , the armature  is conductively compensated.  

If the compensating winding is designed as shown  in  Figure 12-315 , the armature is inductively  compensated. If the motor is designed for operation  on both DC and AC circuits, the compensating winding  is connected in series with the armature. The axis of  the compensating winding is displaced from the main  field axis by an angle of   $90°$  . This arrangement is  similar to the compensating winding used in some DC  motors and generators to overcome armature reaction.  The compensating winding establishes a counter  magnetomotive force, neutralizing the effect of the  armature magnetomotive force, preventing distortion  of the main field flux, and reducing the armature  reactance. The inductively compensated armature  acts like the primary of a transformer, the secondary  

![](images/2d480928cb4491b9638c7e602a1511b8dcba4e8657af87f282645568519b4445.jpg)  
Figure 12-311.   Single-phase motor with capacitor starting winding.  

of which is the shorted compensating winding. The  shorted secondary receives an induced voltage by the  action of the alternating armature flux, and the resulting  current flowing through the turns of the compensating  winding establishes the opposing magnetomotive force,  neutralizing the armature reactance.  

5.	 Sparking at the commutator is reduced by the use of  preventive leads  $\mathrm{P_{1}}$  ,   $\mathrm{P}_{2}$  ,   $\mathrm{P}_{3}$  , and so forth, as shown in  Figure   $_{I2-3I6}$  , where a ring armature is shown for  simplicity. When coils at A and B are shorted by the  brushes, the induced current is limited by the relatively  high resistance of the leads. Sparking at the brushes  is also reduced by using armature coils having only a  single turn and multipolar fields. High torque is obtained  by having a large number of armature conductors and  a large diameter armature. Thus, the commutator has  a large number of very thin commutator bars and the  armature voltage is limited to about 250 volts.  

Fractional horsepower AC series motors are called universal  motors. They do not have compensating windings or  preventive leads. They are used extensively to operate fans  and portable tools, such as drills, grinders, and saws.  

# Maintenance of AC Motors  

The inspection and maintenance of AC motors is very simple.  The bearings may or may not need frequent lubrication. If  they are the sealed type, lubricated at the factory, they require  no further attention. Be sure the coils are kept dry and free  from oil or other abuse. The temperature of a motor is usually  its only limiting operating factor. A good rule of thumb is that  a temperature too hot for the hand is too high for safety. Next  to the temperature, the sound of a motor or generator is the  best trouble indicator. When operating properly, it should hum  evenly. If it is overloaded it “grunts.” A three-phase motor  

![](images/9d3e5839569ec790c333e2b8c991b35107f5390d552fba6724e4dd9409fdf495.jpg)  
Figure 12-312.   Illustrating the operation of a synchronous motor.  

with one lead disconnected refuses to turn and “growls.” A  knocking sound generally indicates a loose armature coil,  a shaft out of alignment, or armature dragging because of  worn bearings. In all cases, the inspection and maintenance  of all AC motors should be performed in accordance with  the applicable manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Alternators  

# Basic Alternators & Classifications  

An electrical generator is a machine that converts mechanical  energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction.  A generator that produces alternating current is referred to  as an AC generator and, through combination of the words  “alternating” and “generator,” the word “alternator” has come  into widespread use. In some areas, the word “alternator” is  applied only to small AC generators. This handbook treats  the two terms synonymously and uses the term “alternator”  to distinguish between AC and DC generators.  

The major difference between an alternator  [Figure 12-317] and a DC generator is the method of connection to the  external circuit. The alternator is connected to the external  circuit by slip rings, but the DC generator is connected by  a commutator.  

# Method of Excitation  

One means of classification is by the type of excitation system  used. In alternators used on aircraft, excitation can be affected  by one of the following methods:  

1.	 A direct connected, DC generator.  This system consists  of a DC generator fixed on the same shaft with the  AC generator. A variation of this system is a type of  alternator that uses DC from the battery for excitation,  after which the alternator is self-excited. 2.	 By transformation and rectification from the AC  system.  This method depends on residual magnetism  for initial AC voltage buildup, after which the field is  supplied with rectified voltage from the AC generator. 3.	 Integrated brushless type.  This arrangement has a DC  generator on the same shaft with an AC generator.  The excitation circuit is completed through silicon  rectifiers rather than a commutator and brushes. The  rectifiers are mounted on the generator shaft and  their output is fed directly to the AC generator’s main  rotating field.  

# Number of Phases  

Another method of classification is by the number of phases  of output voltage. AC generators may be single-phase,  two-phase, three-phase, or even six-phase and more. In the  

![](images/7468100af458a50ed34b54d5bef74f468bb9a5861563a1933e8d3024977814c5.jpg)  
Figure 12-313.   Synchronous motor.  

electrical systems of aircraft, the three-phase alternator is by  far the most common.  

# Armature or Field Rotation  

Still another means of classification is by the type of stator  and rotor used. From this standpoint, there are two types of  alternators: the revolving armature-type and the revolving  field-type. The revolving armature alternator is similar in  construction to the DC generator in that the armature rotates  through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature  alternator is found only in alternators of low-power rating  and generally is not used. In the DC generator, the EMF  generated in the armature windings is converted into a  unidirectional voltage (DC) by means of the commutator.  In the revolving armature-type of alternator, the generated  AC voltage is applied unchanged to the load by means of  slip rings and brushes.  

The revolving field type of alternator has a stationary  armature winding (stator) and a rotating field winding  (rotor).  [Figure 12-318]  The advantage of having a stationary  armature winding is that the armature can be connected  directly to the load without having sliding contacts in the  load circuit. A rotating armature would require slip rings  and brushes to conduct the load current from the armature  to the external circuit. Slip rings have a relatively short  service life and arc over is a continual hazard; therefore, high  voltage alternators are usually of the stationary armature,  rotating field-type. The voltage and current supplied to the  rotating field are relatively small, and slip rings and brushes  for this circuit are adequate. The direct connection to the  armature circuit makes possible the use of large cross-section  conductors, adequately insulated for high voltage. Since the  rotating field alternator is used almost universally in aircraft  systems, this type is explained in detail, as a single-phase,  two-phase, and three-phase alternator.  

# Single-Phase Alternator  

Since the EMF induced in the armature of a generator is  alternating, the same sort of winding can be used on an  alternator as on a DC generator. This type of alternator is  known as a single-phase alternator, but since the power  delivered by a single-phase circuit is pulsating, this type of  circuit is objectionable in many applications.  

A single-phase alternator has a stator made up of a number of  windings in series, forming a single circuit in which an output  voltage is generated.  [Figure 12-319]  The stator has four polar  groups evenly spaced around the stator frame. The rotor has  four poles with adjacent poles of opposite polarity. As the rotor  revolves, AC voltages are induced in the stator windings. Since  one rotor pole is in the same position relative to a stator winding  as any other rotor pole, all stator polar groups are cut by equal  

![](images/24bd59e4b92837b142d2d4b862b3cdfeab411bb16c80becf1c5ade1a0ce95a5b.jpg)

Figure 12-315.   Inductively compensated armature of AC series  motor.  

numbers of magnetic lines of force at any time.  

As a result, the voltages induced in all the windings have  the same amplitude, or value, at any given instant. The four  stator windings are connected to each other so that the AC  voltages are in phase or “series adding.” Assume that rotor  pole 1, a South pole, induces a voltage in the direction  indicated by the arrow in stator winding 1. Since rotor  pole 2 is a North pole, it induces a voltage in the opposite  direction in stator coil 2 with respect to that in coil 1. For  the two induced voltages to be in series addition, the two  coils are connected as shown in  Figure 12-319 . Applying  the same reasoning, the voltage induced in stator coil  3 (clockwise rotation of the field) is the same direction  (counterclockwise) as the voltage induced in coil 1.  

![](images/943d2d2e9e8717b7e4b9eb00643d4a29f0afc165d07408c6c3a67909780b3d05.jpg)  
Figure 12-316.   Preventive coils in AC series motor.  

Similarly, the direction of the voltage induced in winding  4 is opposite to the direction of the voltage induced in coil  1. All four stator coil groups are connected in series so that  the voltages induced in each winding add to give a total  voltage that is four times the voltage in any one winding.  

# Two-Phase Alternator  

Two-phase alternators have two or more single-phase windings  spaced symmetrically around the stator. In a two-phase  alternator, there are two single-phase windings spaced physically  so that the AC voltage induced in one is  $90°$   out of phase with  the voltage induced in the other. The windings are electrically  separate from each other. When one winding is being cut by  maximum flux, the other is being cut by no flux. This condition  establishes a  $90°$   relation between the two phases.  

# Three-Phase Alternator  

A three-phase, or polyphase circuit, is used in most aircraft  alternators, instead of a single or two-phase alternator. The  three-phase alternator has three single-phase windings spaced  so that the voltage induced in each winding is   $120^{\circ}$   out of  phase with the voltages in the other two windings. A schematic  diagram of a three-phase stator showing all the coils becomes  complex and difficult to see what is actually happening.  

A simplified schematic diagram showing each of three  phases is illustrated in  Figure 12-320 . The rotor is omitted for  simplicity. The waveforms of voltage are shown to the right of  the schematic. The three voltages are   $120^{\circ}$   apart and are similar  to the voltages that would be generated by three single-phase  alternators whose voltages are out of phase by angles of   $120^{\circ}$  .  The three phases are independent of each other.  

# Wye Connection (Three-Phase)  

Rather than have six leads from the three-phase alternator,  one of the leads from each phase may be connected to form  a common junction. The stator is then called wye or star  connected. The common lead may or may not be brought out  of the alternator. If it is brought out, it is called the neutral lead.  The simplified schematic shows a wye connected stator with  the common lead not brought out.  [Figure 12-321A]  Each  load is connected across two phases in series. Thus, RAB is  connected across phases A and B in series; RAC is connected  across phases A and C in series; and RBC is connected across  phases B and C in series. Therefore, the voltage across each  load is larger than the voltage across a single phase. The total  voltage, or line voltage, across any two phases is the vector  sum of the individual phase voltages. For balanced conditions,  the line voltage is 1.73 times the phase voltage. Since there is  only one path for current in a line wire and the phase to which  it is connected, the line current is equal to the phase current.  

# Delta Connection (Three-Phase)  

A three-phase stator can also be connected so that the phases  are connected end to end.  [Figure 12-321B]  This arrangement  is called a delta connection. In a delta connection, the voltages  are equal to the phase voltages; the line currents are equal  to the vector sum of the phase currents; and the line current  is equal to 1.73 times the phase current when the loads are  balanced. For equal loads (equal output), the delta connection  supplies increased line current at a value of line voltage equal  to phase voltage, and the wye connection supplies increased  line voltage at a value of line current equal to phase current.  

# Alternator Rectifier Unit  

A type of alternator used in the electrical system of many  aircraft weighing less than 12,500 pounds is shown in  Figure 12-322 . This type of power source is sometimes called  a DC generator, since it is used in DC systems. Although its  output is a DC voltage, it is an alternator rectifier unit. This  type of alternator rectifier is a self-excited unit but does not  contain a permanent magnet. The excitation for starting is  

![](images/37fd9328d56738376fbf0e3eec47c4dc1d3d87143b7f5797e26285857fad8048.jpg)  
Figure 12-317.   Belt driven alternator for small single-engine  aircraft.  

obtained from the battery; immediately after starting, the unit  is self-exciting. Cooling air for the alternator is conducted  into the unit by a blast air tube on the air inlet cover.  

The alternator is directly coupled to the aircraft engine by  means of a flexible drive coupling. The output of the alternator  portion of the unit is three-phase alternating current, derived  from a three-phase, delta connected system incorporating a  three-phase, full-wave bridge rectifier.  [Figure 12-323]  This  unit operates in a speed range from 2,100 to  $9{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , with  a DC output voltage of 26–29 volts and 125 amperes.  

# Brushless Alternator  

This design is more efficient because there are no brushes to  wear down or to arc at high altitudes. This generator consists of  a pilot exciter, an exciter, and the main generator system. The  need for brushes is eliminated by using an integral exciter with  a rotating armature that has its AC output rectified for the main  AC field, which is also of the rotating type.  [Figure 12-324]  

The pilot exciter is an 8-pole,   $8{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  , 533 cps, AC  generator. The pilot exciter field is mounted on the main  generator rotor shaft and is connected in series with the main  generator field. The pilot exciter armature is mounted on the  main generator stator. The AC output of the pilot exciter is  supplied to the voltage regulator, where it is rectified and  controlled, and is then impressed on the exciter field winding  to furnish excitation for the generator.  

The exciter is a small AC generator with its field mounted  

![](images/9af86c15b70b8c221f93e2cad374ba77b0a7ac9547fffafeed2303d3a875a1c2.jpg)  
Figure 12-318.   Alternator with stationary armature and rotating  field.  

on the main generator stator and its three-phase armature  mounted on the generator rotor shaft. Included in the exciter  field are permanent magnets mounted on the main generator  stator between the exciter poles.  

The exciter field resistance is temperature compensated by a  thermistor. This aids regulation by keeping a nearly constant  resistance at the regulator output terminals. The exciter  output is rectified and impressed on the main generator  field and the pilot exciter field. The exciter stator has a  stabilizing field, which is used to improve stability and to  prevent voltage regulator over-corrections for changes in  generator output voltage.  

The AC generator shown in  Figure 12-324  is a 6-pole, 8,000  rpm unit having a rating of 31.5 kilovoltamperes (kVA),   $115200$   volts, 400 cps. This generator is three-phase, 4 wire,  wye connected with grounded neutrals. By using an integral  AC exciter, the necessity for brushes within the generator  has been eliminated. The AC output of the rotating exciter  armature is fed directly into the three-phase, full-wave,  rectifier bridge located inside the rotor shaft, which uses  high-temperature silicon rectifiers. The DC output from the  rectifier bridge is fed to the main AC generator rotating field.  

Voltage regulation is accomplished by varying the strength  of the AC exciter stationary fields. Polarity reversals of the  AC generator are eliminated and radio noise is minimized  by the absence of the brushes. A noise filter mounted on  the alternator further reduces any existing radio noise.  The rotating pole structure of the generator is laminated  from steel punchings, containing all six poles and a  connecting hub section. This provides optimum magnetic  and mechanical properties.  

Some alternators are cooled by circulating oil through steel  tubes. The oil used for cooling is supplied from the constant  speed drive assembly. Ports located in the flange connecting  the generator and drive assemblies make oil flow between  the constant speed drive and the generator possible.  

![](images/72eb560f2908e4b61e250631c8f2c5632943f744f216eb949655f350b964bfc8.jpg)  
Figure 12-319.   Single-phase alternator.  

Voltage is built up by using permanent magnet interpoles in  the exciter stator. The permanent magnets assure a voltage  buildup, precluding the necessity of field flashing. The rotor  of the alternator may be removed without causing loss of the  alternator’s residual magnetism.  

# Alternator Frequency  

The frequency of the alternator voltage depends upon the  speed of rotation of the rotor and the number of poles.  The faster the speed, the higher the frequency; the lower  the speed, the lower the frequency. The more poles on the  rotor, the higher the frequency for a given speed. When a  rotor has rotated through an angle so that two adjacent rotor  poles (a North and a South pole) have passed one winding,  the voltage induced in that winding has varied through one  complete cycle. For a given frequency, the greater the number  of pairs of poles, the lower the speed of rotation. A two-pole  alternator rotates at twice the speed of a four-pole alternator  for the same frequency of generated voltage. The frequency  of the alternator in cycles per minute (cpm) is related to the  number of poles and the speed, as expressed by the equation:  

$$
\mathrm{F}={\frac{\mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{N}}}\times{\frac{\mathrm{N}}{60}}={\frac{\mathrm{PN}}{120}}
$$  

Where:	   $\mathrm{P}$   is the number of poles per phase  

f is the frequency in cps  $_\mathrm{N}$   is the rated speed in rpm  

For example, a 2-pole,  $3{,}600\,\mathrm{rpm}$   alternator has a frequency of:  

$$
\frac{2\times3{,}600}{120}=60\;\mathsf{c p s}
$$  

A 4-pole,   $1{,}800~\mathrm{rpm}$   alternator has the same frequency; a  6-pole,  $500\,\mathrm{rpm}$   alternator has a frequency of:  

$$
\frac{6\times500}{120}\,{=}\,25\;\mathrm{cps}
$$  

A 12-pole, 4,000 rpm alternator has a frequency of:

# Starter Generator  

Many turbine-powered aircraft use a starter generator that  acts like a starter during the start of the engine and when the  engine is online it acts like a Generator.  [Figure 12-325]  The  main advantage of the starter generator is saving weight by  eliminating a separate starter that is only used during the start.  Initially used on small turboprops and light jets but large units  are now installed on the B787 aircraft engines to power the  main engines and power the electrical system.  

# Alternator Rating  

The maximum current that can be supplied by an alternator  depends upon the maximum heating loss   $\mathrm{I}^{2}\mathrm{R}$   power loss) that  can be sustained in the armature and the maximum heating loss  that can be sustained in the field. The armature current of an  alternator varies with the load. This action is similar to that of A  12 pole, 4,000 rpm alternator has a frequency of DC generators.  In AC generators, however, lagging power factor loads tend  to demagnetize the field of an alternator, and terminal voltage  is maintained only by increasing DC field current. For this  reason, AC generators are usually rated according to kVA,  power factor, phases, voltage, and frequency. One generator,  for example, may be rated at  $40\;\mathrm{kVA}$  , 208 volts, 400 cycles,  three phase, at 75 percent power factor. The kVA indicates the  apparent power. This is the kVA output, or the relationship  between the current and voltage at which the generator is  intended to operate. The power factor is the expression of the

ratio between the apparent power (volt-amperes) and the true  or effective power (watts). The number of phases is the number  of independent voltages generated. Three-phase generators  generate three voltages 120 electrical degrees apart.  

# Alternator Maintenance  

Maintenance and inspection of alternator systems is similar  to that of DC systems. Check the exciter brushes for wear and  surfacing. On most large aircraft with two or four alternator  systems, each power panel has three signal lights, one  connected to each phase of the power bus, so the lamp lights  when the panel power is on. The individual buses throughout  the airplane can be checked by operating equipment from that  particular bus. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions on  operation of equipment for the method of testing each bus.  

Alternator test stands are used for testing alternators and  constant speed drives in a repair facility. They are capable of  supplying power to constant speed drive units at input speeds  varying from   ${}^{2,400\,\mathrm{rpm}}$   to   $9{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

A typical test stand motor uses 220/440 volt, 60 cycle,  three-phase power. Blowers for ventilation, oil coolers,  and necessary meters and switches are integral parts of the  test stand. A load bank supplies test circuits. An AC motor  generator set for ground testing is shown in  Figure 12-326 .  

A typical, portable, AC electrical system test set is an  analyzer, consisting of a multirange ohmmeter, a multirange  combination AC DC voltmeter, an ammeter with a clip-on  current transformer, a vibrating reed type frequency meter,

A portable load bank unit furnishes a load similar to that  on the airplane for testing alternators, either while mounted  in the airplane or on the shop test stand. A complete unit  consists of resistive and reactive loads controlled by selector  switches and test meters mounted on a control panel. This  load unit is compact and convenient, eliminating the difficulty  of operating large loads on the airplane while testing and  adjusting the alternators and control equipment.  

Proper maintenance of an alternator requires that the unit be  kept clean and that all electrical connections are tight and  in good repair. If the alternator fails to build up voltage as  designated by applicable manufacturer’s technical instructions,  test the voltmeter first by checking the voltages of other  alternators, or by checking the voltage in the suspected  alternator with another voltmeter and comparing the results.  If the voltmeter is satisfactory, check the wiring, the brushes,  and the drive unit for faults. If this inspection fails to reveal  the trouble, the exciter may have lost its residual magnetism.  Residual magnetism is restored to the exciter by flashing the  field. Follow the applicable manufacturer’s instructions when  flashing the exciter field. If, after flashing the field, no voltage  is indicated, replace the alternator, since it is probably faulty.  

Clean the alternator exterior with an approved fluid; smooth  a rough or pitted exciter commutator or slip ring with 000  sandpaper; then clean and polish with a clean, dry cloth. Check  the brushes periodically for length and general condition.  Consult the applicable manufacturer’s instructions on the  specific alternator to obtain information on the correct brushes.  

# Regulation of Generator Voltage  

Efficient operation of electrical equipment in an airplane  depends on a constant voltage supply from the generator.  Among the factors, which determine the voltage output of a  generator, only one, the strength of the field current, can be  conveniently controlled. To illustrate this control, refer to the  diagram in  Figure 12-327 , showing a simple generator with  a rheostat in the field circuit. If the rheostat is set to increase  the resistance in the field circuit, less current flows through  the field winding and the strength of the magnetic field in  which the armature rotates decreases. Consequently, the  voltage output of the generator decreases. If the resistance in  the field circuit is decreased with the rheostat, more current  flows through the field windings, the magnetic field becomes  stronger, and the generator produces a greater voltage.  

Voltage Regulation with a Vibrating-Type Regulator Refer to  Figure 12-328 . With the generator running at  normal speed and switch K open, the field rheostat is  adjusted so that the terminal voltage is about 60 percent of  

![](images/6b971df00484f77e81d035a80273eb7d527817afd11a701b70a2decb1052189a.jpg)

normal. Solenoid S is weak and contact B is held closed  by the spring. When K is closed, a short circuit is placed  across the field rheostat. This action causes the field current  to increase and the terminal voltage to rise.  

When the terminal voltage rises above a certain critical value,  the solenoid downward pull exceeds the spring tension and  contact B opens, thus reinserting the field rheostat in the field  circuit and reducing the field current and terminal voltage.  

When the terminal voltage falls below a certain critical voltage,  the solenoid armature contact B is closed again by the spring,  the field rheostat is now shorted, and the terminal voltage starts  to rise. The cycle repeats with a rapid, continuous action. Thus,  an average voltage is maintained with or without load change.  

The dashpot  $\mathrm{P}$   provides smoother operation by acting as a  damper to prevent hunting. The capacitor C across contact B  eliminates sparking. Added load causes the field rheostat to  be shorted for a longer period of time and, thus, the solenoid  armature vibrates more slowly. If the load is reduced and the  terminal voltage rises, the armature vibrates more rapidly and  the regulator holds the terminal voltage to a steady value for  any change in load, from no load to full load, on the generator.  

Vibrating-type regulators cannot be used with generators,  which require a high-field current, since the contacts pit or  burn. Heavy-duty generator systems require a different type  of regulator, such as the carbon pile voltage regulator.  

# Three Unit Regulators  

Many light aircraft employ a three unit regulator for their  generator systems.  [Figure 12-329]  This type of regulator  includes a current limiter and a reverse current cut-out in  addition to a voltage regulator.  

The action of the voltage regulator unit is similar to the  vibrating-type regulator described earlier. The second of the  three units is a current regulator to limit the output current  of the generator. The third unit is a reverse current cut-out  that disconnects the battery from the generator. If the battery  is not disconnected, it discharges through the generator  armature when the generator voltage falls below that of the  battery, thus driving the generator as a motor. This action is  called “motoring” the generator and, unless it is prevented,  it discharges the battery in a short time.  

The operation of a three unit regulator is described in the  following paragraphs.  [Figure 12-330]  

The action of vibrating contact C1 in the voltage regulator  unit causes an intermittent short circuit between points R1 and  L2. When the generator is not operating, spring S1 holds C1  closed; C2 is also closed by S2. The shunt field is connected  directly across the armature.  

When the generator is started, its terminal voltage rises as  the generator comes up to speed, and the armature supplies  the field with current through closed contacts C2 and C1.  

![](images/58479b15e8863b35d0746f12691ec5170029a6c0a1035d51f0869a0382e2f6ce.jpg)  
Figure 12-325.   Starter generator for small business jet.  

As the terminal voltage rises, the current flow through L1  increases and the iron core becomes more strongly magnetized.  At a certain speed and voltage, when the magnetic attraction  on the movable arm becomes strong enough to overcome the  tension of spring S1, contact points C1 are separated. The field  current now flows through R1 and L2. Because resistance is  added to the field circuit, the field is momentarily weakened  and the rise in terminal voltage is checked. Also, since the  L2 winding is opposed to the L1 winding, the magnetic pull  of L1 against S1 is partially neutralized, and spring S1 closes  contact C1. Therefore, R1 and L2 are again shorted out of  the circuit, and the field current again increases; the output  voltage increases, and C1 is opened because of the action of  L1. The cycle is rapid and occurs many times per second. The  terminal voltage of the generator varies slightly, but rapidly,  above and below an average value determined by the tension  of spring S1, which may be adjusted.  

The purpose of the vibrator-type current limiter is to limit the  output current of the generator automatically to its maximum  rated value in order to protect the generator. As shown in  Figure 12-330 , L3 is in series with the main line and load.  Thus, the amount of current flowing in the line determines  when C2 is opened and R2 placed in series with the generator  field. By contrast, the voltage regulator is actuated by line  voltage, whereas the current limiter is actuated by line current.  Spring S2 holds contact C2 closed until the current through  the main line and L3 exceeds a certain value, as determined  by the tension of spring S2, and causes C2 to be opened.  The increase in current is due to an increase in load. This  action inserts R2 into the field circuit of the generator and  decreases the field current and the generated voltage. When  the generated voltage is decreased, the generator current is  reduced. The core of L3 is partly demagnetized and the spring  closes the contact points. This causes the generator voltage  and current to rise until the current reaches a value sufficient  to start the cycle again. A certain minimum value of load  current is necessary to cause the current limiter to vibrate.  

The purpose of the reverse current cut-out relay is to  automatically disconnect the battery from the generator when  the generator voltage is less than the battery voltage. If this  device were not used in the generator circuit, the battery  would discharge through the generator. This would tend  to make the generator operate as a motor, but because the  generator is coupled to the engine, it could not rotate such  a heavy load. Under this condition, the generator windings  may be severely damaged by excessive current.  

There are two windings, L4 and L5, on the soft iron core. The  current winding, L4, consisting of a few turns of heavy wire,  is in series with the line and carries the entire line current.  

![](images/aab4771326df5f78431968acdbd674912a3e18007760f1671b7377e5a833bd2d.jpg)  
Figure 12-326.   AC motor generator set for ground testing.  

The voltage winding, L5, consisting of a large number of  turns of fine wire, is shunted across the generator terminals.  

When the generator is not operating, the contacts, C3 are held  open by the spring S3. As the generator voltage builds up, L5  magnetizes the iron core. When the current (as a result of the  generated voltage) produces sufficient magnetism in the iron  core, contact C3 is closed, as shown. The battery then receives  a charging current. The coil spring, S3, is so adjusted that the  voltage winding does not close the contact points until the  voltage of the generator is in excess of the normal voltage of  the battery. The charging current passing through L4 aids the  current in L5 to hold the contacts tightly closed. Unlike C1  and C2, contact C3 does not vibrate. When the generator slows  down or, for any other cause, the generator voltage decreases  to a certain value below that of the battery, the current reverses  through L4 and the ampere turns of L4 oppose those of L5.  Thus, a momentary discharge current from the battery reduces  the magnetism of the core and C3 is opened, preventing the  battery from discharging into the generator and motoring it.  C3 does not close again until the generator terminal voltage  exceeds that of the battery by a predetermined value.

# Differential Relay Switch  

Aircraft electrical systems normally use some type of reverse  current relay switch, which acts not only as a reverse current  relay cut-out but also serves as a remote control switch by  which the generator can be disconnected from the electrical  system at any time. One type of reverse current relay switch  operates on the voltage level of the generator, but the type  most commonly used on large aircraft is the differential  relay switch, which is controlled by the difference in voltage  

![](images/2de41218b372ef58facd92c06d69a567cc456b2f5fc99cb7d02c2ec5267f914f.jpg)  
Figure 12-328.   Vibrating-type voltage regulator.  

between the battery bus and the generator.  

The differential type relay switch connects the generator to  the main bus bar in the electrical system when the generator  voltage output exceeds the bus voltage by 0.35 to 0.65 volt.  It disconnects the generator when a nominal reverse current  flows from the bus to the generator. The differential relays on  all the generators of a multiengine aircraft do not close when  the electrical load is light. For example, in an aircraft having  a load of 50 amperes, only two or three relays may close.  If a heavy load is applied, the equalizing circuit lowers the  voltage of the generators already on the bus and, at the same  time, raise the voltage of the remaining generators, allowing  their relays to close. If the generators have been paralleled  properly, all the relays stay closed until the generator control  switch is turned off or until the engine speed falls below the  minimum needed to maintain generator output voltage.  

The differential generator control relay shown in  Figure 12-331 is made up of two relays and a coil-operated contactor. One  relay is the voltage relay and the other is the differential relay.  Both relays include permanent magnets that pivot between  the pole pieces of temporary magnets wound with relay coils.  Voltages of one polarity set up fields about the temporary  magnets with polarities that cause the permanent magnet to  move in the direction necessary to close the relay contacts;  voltages of the opposite polarity establish fields that cause  the relay contacts to open. The differential relay has two  coils wound on the same core. The coil-operated contactor,  called the main contactor, consists of movable contacts that  are operated by a coil with a movable iron core.  

Closing the generator switch on the control panel connects  the generator output to the voltage relay coil. When generator  voltage reaches 22 volts, current flows through the coil  and closes the contacts of the voltage relay. This action  completes a circuit from the generator to the battery through  the differential coil.  

![](images/0bc70c041da00cae4e074a358e342d197dec3ef5700c1b8d8160030603f1243a.jpg)  
Figure 12-329.   Three unit regulator.  

When the generator voltage exceeds the bus voltage by  0.35 volt, current flows through the differential coil, the  differential relay contact closes and, thus, completes the main  contractor coil circuit. The contacts of the main contactor  close and connect the generator to the bus.  

When the generator voltage drops below the bus (or battery)  voltage, a reverse current weakens the magnetic field about  the temporary magnet of the differential relay. The weakened  field permits a spring to open the differential relay contacts,  breaking the circuit to the coil of the main contactor relay,  opening its contacts, and disconnecting the generator from  the bus. The generator battery circuit may also be broken  by opening the flight deck control switch, which opens the  contacts of the voltage relay, causing the differential relay  coil to be de-energized.  

# Overvoltage & Field Control Relays  

Two other items used with generator control circuits are the  overvoltage control and the field control relay. As its name  implies, the overvoltage control protects the system when  

![](images/d37196e9d5a69de28b4ddb736943b5a53b8818b00a8b16dccd005c6aa8b61937.jpg)  
Figure 12-330.   Three unit regulator for variable speed generators.  

excessive voltage exists. The overvoltage relay is closed  when the generator output reaches 32 volts and completes a  circuit to the trip coil of the field control relay. The closing of  the field control relay trip circuit opens the shunt field circuit  and completes it through a resistor, causing generator voltage  to drop; also, the generator switch circuit and the equalizer  circuit (multiengine aircraft) are opened. An indicator light  circuit is completed, warning that an overvoltage condition  exists. A “reset” position of the flight deck switch is used  to complete a reset coil circuit in the field control relay,  returning the relay to its normal position.  

# Generator Control Units (GCU)  

# Basic Functions of a Generator Control Unit (GCU)  

The generator control unit (GCU) is more commonly found  on turbine power aircraft. The most basic GCU perform a  number of functions related to the regulation, sensing, and  protection of the DC generation system.  [Figure 12-332]  

# Voltage Regulation  

The most basic of the GCU functions is that of voltage  regulation. Regulation of any kind requires the regulation unit  to take a sample of an output and to compare that sample with  a controlled reference. If the sample taken falls outside of the  limits set by the reference, then the regulation unit must provide  an adjustment to the unit generating the output so as to diminish  or increase the output levels. In the case of the GCU, the output  voltage from a generator is sensed by the GCU and compared  to a reference voltage. If there is any difference between the  two, the error is usually amplified and then sent back to the field  excitation control portion of the circuit. The field excitation  control then makes voltage⁄excitation adjustments in the field  winding of the generator in order to bring the output voltage  back into required bus tolerances.  

# Overvoltage Protection  

Like the voltage regulation feature of the GCU, the  overvoltage protection system compares the sampled voltage  to reference voltage. The output of the overvoltage protection  circuit is used to open the relay that controls the output for the  field excitation. These types of faults can occur for a number  of reasons. The most common, however, is the failure of the  voltage regulation circuit in the GCU.  

# Parallel Generator Operations  

The paralleling feature of the GCU allows for two or more  GCU/generator systems to work in a shared effort to provide  current to the aircraft electrical system. Comparing voltages  between the equalizer bus and the interpole/compensator  voltage, and amplifying the differences accomplishes the  control of this system. The difference is then sent to the  voltage regulation circuit, where adjustments are then made  in the regulation output. These adjustments continue until all  

# Over-Excitation Protection  

When a GCU in a paralleled system fails, a situation can  occur where one of the generators becomes overexcited and  tries to carry more than its share of the load, if not all of  the loads. When this condition is sensed on the equalizing  bus, the faulted generation control system shuts down  by receiving a de-excitation signal. This signal is then  transmitted to the overvoltage circuit, and then opens the  field excitation output circuit.  

# Differential Voltage  

When the GCU allows the logic output to close the generator  line contactor, the generator voltage must be within a close  tolerance of the load bus. If the output is not within the  specified tolerance, then the contactor is not allowed to  connect the generator to the bus.  

# Reverse Current Sensing  

If the generator is unable to maintain the required voltage  level, it eventually begins to draw current instead of providing  it. In this case, the faulty generator is seen as a load to the  other generators and will need to be removed from the  bus. Once the generator is off-line, it is not permitted to be  reconnected to the bus until such time that the generator faults  are cleared and the generator is capable of providing a current  to the bus. In most cases, the differential voltage circuit and  the reverse current sensing circuit are one in the same.  

# Alternator Constant Speed Drive System  

Alternators are not always connected directly to the airplane  engine like DC generators. Since the various electrical  devices operating on AC supplied by alternators are designed  to operate at a certain voltage and at a specified frequency,  the speed of the alternators must be constant; however, the  speed of an airplane engine varies. Therefore, the engine,  through a constant speed drive installed between the engine  and the alternator, drives some alternators.  

A typical hydraulic-type drive is shown in  Figure 12-333 .  The following discussion of a constant speed drive system  is based on such a drive found on large multiengine aircraft. The constant speed drive is a hydraulic transmission that may  be controlled either electrically or mechanically.  

The constant speed drive assembly is designed to deliver an  output of   $6{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  , provided the input remains between  2,800 and   $9{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  . If the input, which is determined by  engine speed, is below   $6{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  , the drive increases the  speed in order to furnish the desired output. This stepping  up of speed is known as overdrive.  

![](images/f1d7ebab4390ed755630662e39a8e66610799bb75878c0d34b3916e1eb8506b1.jpg)  
Figure 12-331.   Differential generator control relay.  

In overdrive, an automobile engine operates at about the  same rpm at  $60\ \mathrm{mph}$   as it does in conventional drive at 49  mph. In aircraft, this principle is applied in the same manner.  The constant speed drive enables the alternator to produce  the same frequency at slightly above engine idle rpm as it  would at takeoff or cruising rpm.  

With the input speed to the drive set at  $6{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , the output  speed is the same. This is known as straight drive and might  be compared to an automobile in high gear. However, when  the input speed is greater than  $6{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , it must be reduced  to provide an output of  $6{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . This is called underdrive,  which is comparable to an automobile in low gear. Thus, the  large input, caused by high engine rpm, is reduced to give  the desired alternator speed.  

As a result of this control by the constant speed drive, the  frequency output of the generator varies from 420 cps at no  load to 400 cps under full load. This, in brief, is the function  of the constant speed drive assembly. Before discussing  the various units and circuits, the overall operation of the  transmission should be discussed as follows.  

# Hydraulic Transmission  

The transmission is mounted between the generator and the  aircraft engine. Its name denotes that hydraulic oil is used,  although some transmissions may use engine oil. Refer to the  cutaway view of such a transmission in  Figure 12-334.  The  input shaft D is driven from the drive shaft on the accessory  section of the engine. The output drive F, on the opposite end  of the transmission, engages the drive shaft of the generator.  

The input shaft is geared to the rotating cylinder block gear,  which it drives, as well as to the makeup and scavenger  gear pumps E.  

The makeup (charge) pump delivers oil (300 psi) to the pump  and motor cylinder block, to the governor system, and to the  pressurized case, whereas the scavenger pump returns the oil  to the external reservoir.  

The rotating cylinder assembly B consists of the pump and  motor cylinder blocks, which are bolted to opposite sides of  a port plate. The two other major parts are the motor wobbler  A and the pump wobbler C. The governor system is the unit  at the top of the left side in  Figure 12-334 .  

The cylinder assembly has two primary units. The block  assembly of one of the units, the pump, contains 14 cylinders,  each of which has a piston and pushrod. Charge pressure from  the makeup pump is applied to each piston in order to force  it outward against the pushrod. It, in turn, is pushed against  the pump wobble plate.  

If the plate remained as shown in  Figure 12-335A , each of the  14 cylinders would have equal pressure, and all pistons would  be in the same relative position in their respective cylinders.  But with the plate tilted, the top portion moves outward and  the lower portion inward.  [Figure 12-335B]  As a result, more  oil enters the interior of the upper cylinder, but oil is forced  from the cylinder of the bottom piston.  

If the pump block were rotated while the plate remained  stationary, the top piston would be forced inward because of  the angle of the plate. This action would cause the oil confined  within the cylinder to be subjected to increased pressure great  

![](images/dbceb38f89a66973b50011bc1a512f2ae786067e91e04b759833ed8e389f97b5.jpg)  
Figure 12-332.   Generator Control Unit (GCU).  

enough to force it into the motor cylinder block assembly.  

Before explaining what the high-pressure oil in the motor  unit does, it is necessary to know something about this part  of the rotating cylinder block assembly. The motor block  assembly has 16 cylinders, each with its piston and pushrod.  These are constantly receiving charge pressure of 300 psi.  The position of the piston depends upon the point at which  each pushrod touches the motor wobble plate. These rods  cause the wobble plate to rotate by the pressure they exert  against its sloping surface.  

The piston and pushrod of the motor are pushed outward as  oil is forced through the motor valve plate from the pump  cylinder. The pushrods are forced against the motor wobble  plate, which is free to rotate but cannot change the angle at  which it is set. Since the pushrods cannot move sideways,  the pressure exerted against the motor wobble plate’s sloping  face causes it to rotate.  

In the actual transmission, there is an adjustable wobble plate.  The control cylinder assembly determines the tilt of the pump  wobble plate. For example, it is set at an angle, which causes  the motor cylinders to turn the motor wobble plate faster than  the motor assembly if the transmission is in overdrive. The  greater pressure in the pump and motor cylinders produces  the result described.  

With the transmission in underdrive, the angle is arranged so  there is a reduction in pumping action. The subsequent slippage  between the pushrods and motor wobble plate reduces the  output speed of the transmission. When the pump wobble plate  is not at an angle, the pumping action is at a minimum and  the transmission has what is known as hydraulic lock. For this  condition, the input and output speed is about the same, and  the transmission is considered to be in straight drive.  

To prevent the oil temperature from becoming excessively  high within the cylinder block, the makeup pressure pump  forces oil through the center of this block and the pressure  relief valve. From this valve, the oil flows into the bottom  of the transmission case. A scavenger pump removes the  oil from the transmission case and circulates it through the  oil cooler and filters before returning it to the reservoir. At  the start of the cycle, oil is drawn from the reservoir, passed  through a filter, and forced into the cylinder block by the  makeup pressure pump.  

The clutch, located in the output gear and clutch assembly,  is an overrunning one way, sprag-type device. Its purpose  is to ratchet if the alternator becomes motorized; otherwise,  the alternator might turn the engine. Furthermore, the clutch  provides a positive connection when the transmission is  driving the alternator.  

There is another unit of the drive that must be discussed—the  governor system. The governor system, which consists of a  hydraulic cylinder with a piston, is electrically controlled. Its  duty is to regulate oil pressure flowing to the control cylinder  assembly.  [Figure 12-336]  

The center of the system’s hydraulic cylinder is slotted so the  arm of the pump wobble plate can be connected to the piston.  As oil pressure moves the piston, the pump wobble plate is  placed in either overspeed, underspeed, or straight drive.  

Figure 12-337  shows the electrical circuit used to  govern the speed of the transmission. First, the main  points of the complete electrical control circuit are  discussed.  [Figures 12-337  and  12-338]  For simplification,  two portions, the overspeed circuit and the load division  circuit, are considered as individual circuits.  

Note, in  Figure 12-337 , that the circuit has a valve and  solenoid assembly (O) and a control cylinder (E), and that  it contains such units as the tachometer generator (D), the  rectifier (C), and adjustable resistor (B), rheostat (A), and  the control coil (Q).  

![](images/347659d6c260c96cbafa102a9bbb515e68ea8c355e9e6a458c486a081f425e71.jpg)  
Figure 12-333.   Constant speed drive.  

procedure is reversed.  

Since it is driven by a drive gear in the transmission, the  tachometer (often called tach) generator, a three-phase unit,  has a voltage proportional to the speed of the output drive.  The rectifier changes its voltage from AC to DC. After  rectification, the current flows through the resistor, rheostat,  and valve and solenoid. Each of these units is connected in  series.  [Figure 12-338]  

Under normal operating conditions, the output of the tach  generator causes just enough current to enter the valve and  solenoid coil to set up a magnetic field of sufficient strength  to balance the spring force in the valve. When the alternator  speed increases as the result of a decrease in load, the tach  generator output also increases. Because of the greater output,  the coil in the solenoid is sufficiently strengthened to overcome  the spring force. Thus, the valve moves and, as a result, oil  pressure enters the reduced speed side of the control cylinder.  

In turn, the pressure moves the piston, causing the angle of  the pump wobble plate to be reduced. The oil on the other  side of the piston is forced back through the valve into the  system return. Since the angle of the pump wobble plate is  smaller, there is less pumping action in the transmission. The  result is decreased output speed. To complete the cycle, the  With the output speed reduction, tach generator output  decreases; consequently, the flow of current to the solenoid  diminishes. Therefore, the magnetic field of the solenoid  becomes so weak that the spring is able to overcome it and  reposition the valve.  

If a heavy load is put on the AC generator, its speed decreases.  The generator is not driven directly by the engine; the  hydraulic drive allows slippage. This decrease causes the  output of the tach generator to taper off and, as a result,  weakens the magnetic field of the solenoid coil. The spring  in the solenoid moves the valve and allows oil pressure to  enter the increase side of the control cylinder and the output  speed of the transmission is raised.  

There are still two important circuits that must be discussed:  the overspeed circuit and the load division circuit. The  generator is prevented from overspeeding by a centrifugal  switch (S) in  Figure 12-339  and the overspeed solenoid coil  (R), which is located in the solenoid and valve assembly.  The centrifugal switch is on the transmission and is driven  through the same gear arrangement as the tach generator.  

![](images/d1dd56813f436405d92abfee35e9647a56943e959b574acac1eea77c1dcce9b9.jpg)  
Figure 12-334.   Cutaway of a hydraulic transmission.  

The aircraft DC system furnishes the power to operate the  overspeed coil in the solenoid and coil assembly. If the  output speed of the transmission reaches a speed of 7,000  to   $7{,}500~\mathrm{rpm}$  , the centrifugal switch closes the DC circuit  and energizes the overspeed solenoid. This component then  moves the valve and engages the latch that holds the valve  in the underdrive position. To release the latch, energize the  underdrive release solenoid.  

The load division circuit’s function is to equalize the loads  placed on each of the alternators, which is necessary to  assure that each alternator assumes its share; otherwise,  one alternator might be overloaded while another would be  carrying only a small load.  

In  Figure 12-340 , one phase of the alternator provides power  for the primary in transformer (G), whose secondary supplies  power to the primaries of two other transformers (  $\mathrm{J}_{1}$   and   $\mathrm{J}_{2}$  ). Rectifiers (K) then change the output of the transformer  secondaries from AC to DC.  

The function of the two capacitors (L) is to smooth out the  DC pulsations.  

The output of the current transformer (F) depends upon the  amount of current flowing in the line of one phase. In this  way, it measures the real load of the generator. The output  voltage of the current transformer is applied across resistor  (H). This voltage is added vectorially to the voltage applied  to the upper winding of transformer (J) by the output of  transformer (F). At the same time as it adds vectorially to  the upper winding of transformer (J), it subtracts vectorially  from the voltage applied to the lower winding of (J).  

This voltage addition and subtraction depends on the real load  of the generator. The amount of real load determines the phase  

![](images/172e304c99d3f72146426f36cb11c9ae9577f2702a3c3c0ec136f28b00717aa3.jpg)

angle and the amount of voltage impressed across resistor   $\mathrm{(H)}$  The greater the real load, the greater the voltage across (H), and  hence, the greater the difference between the voltages applied  to the two primaries of transformer (J). The unequal voltages  applied to resistor (M) by the secondaries of transformer (J)  cause a current flow through the control coil (P).  

The control coil is wound so that its voltage supplements  the voltage for the control coil in the valve and solenoid  assembly. The resulting increased voltage moves the valve  and slows down the generator’s speed. Why should the speed  be decreased if the load has been increased? Actually, systems  using only one generator would not have decreased speed,  but for those having two or more generators, a decrease is  necessary to equalize the loads.  

The load division circuit is employed only when two or more  generators supply power. In such systems, the control coils  are connected in parallel. If the source voltage for one of these  becomes higher than the others, it determines the direction of  current flow throughout the entire load division circuit. As  explained before, the real load on the generator determines  the amount of voltage on the control coil; therefore, the  generator with the highest real load has the highest voltage.  

As shown in  Figure 12-341 , current through No. 1 control  coil, where the largest load exists, aids the control coil of the  valve and solenoid, thereby slowing down the generator. (The  source voltage of the control coils is represented by battery  symbols in  Figure 12-341 .) The current in the remaining  control coils opposes the control coil of the valve and  solenoid, in order to increase the speed of the other generators  so the load is more evenly distributed.  

On some drives, instead of an electrically-controlled  governor, a flyweight-type governor is employed, which  consists of a recess-type revolving valve driven by the  output shaft of the drive, flyweights, two coil springs, and  a nonrotating valve stem. Centrifugal force, acting on the  governor flyweights, causes them to move outward, lifting  the valve stem against the opposition of a coil spring.  

The valve stem position controls the directing of oil to the  two oil outlines. If the output speed tends to exceed 6,000  rpm, the flyweights lift the valve stem to direct more oil to  the side of the control piston, causing the piston to move in a  direction to reduce the pump wobble plate angle. If the speed  drops below   $6{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  , oil is directed to the control piston  so that it moves to increase the wobble plate angle.  

Overspeed protection is installed in the governor. The drive  starts in the underdrive position. The governor coil springs  are fully extended and the valve stem is held at the limit of  its downward travel. In this condition, pressure is directed  to the side of the control piston giving minimum wobble  plate angle. The maximum angle side of the control piston  is open to the hollow stem. As the input speed increases, the  flyweights start to move outward to overcome the spring bias.  This action lifts the valve stem and starts directing oil to the  maximum side of the control piston, while the minimum side  is opened to the hollow stem.  

At about   $6{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  , the stem is positioned to stop drainage  of either side, and the two pressures seek a balance point as

the flyweight force is balanced against the spring bias. Thus,  a mechanical failure in the governor causes an underdrive  condition. The flyweight’s force is always tending to move  the valve stem to the decrease speed position so that, if the  coil spring breaks and the stem moves to the extreme position  in that direction, output speed is reduced. If the input to the  governor fails, the spring forces the stem all the way to the  start position to obtain minimum output speed.

Figure 12-338.   Speed control circuit.  

An adjustment screw on the end of the governor regulates  the output speed of the constant speed drive. This adjustment  increases or decreases the compression of a coil spring,  opposing the action of the flyweights. The adjustment  screws turn in an indented collar, which provides a means of  making speed adjustments in known increments. Each “click”  provides a small change in generator frequency.  

The constant speed drive (CSD) can be an independent unit  or mounted within the alternator housing. When the CSD and  the alternator are contained within one unit, the assembly is  known as an integrated drive generator (IDG).  

# Voltage Regulation of Alternators  

The problem of voltage regulation in an AC system does not  differ basically from that in a DC system. In each case, the  function of the regulator system is to control voltage, maintain  a balance of circulating current throughout the system, and  eliminate sudden changes in voltage (anti-hunting) when a  load is applied to the system. However, there is one important  difference between the regulator system of DC generators  and alternators operated in a parallel configuration. The load  carried by any particular DC generator in either a two or four  generator system depends on its voltage as compared with the  bus voltage, while the division of load between alternators  depends upon the adjustments of their speed governors,  which are controlled by the frequency and droop circuits  discussed in the previous section on alternator constant-speed  drive systems.  

When AC generators are operated in parallel, frequency and  voltage must both be equal. Where a synchronizing force is  required to equalize only the voltage between DC generators,  synchronizing forces are required to equalize both voltage and  speed (frequency) between AC generators. On a comparative  basis, the synchronizing forces for AC generators are much  greater than for DC generators. When AC generators are of  sufficient size and are operating at unequal frequencies and  terminal voltages, serious damage may result if they are  suddenly connected to each other through a common bus. To  avoid this, the generators must be synchronized as closely as  possible before connecting them together.  

Regulating the voltage output of a DC exciter, which  supplies current to the alternator rotor field, best controls  the output voltage of an alternator. This is accomplished  by the regulation of a 28-volt system connected in the field  circuit of the exciter. A regulator controls the exciter field  current and thus regulates the exciter output voltage applied  

![](images/ebc1efca6b9bc5b4649a37ea2965861277768d55ad28e2d0079958ca03845250.jpg)

to the alternator field.  

# Alternator Transistorized Regulators  

Many aircraft alternator systems use a transistorized voltage  regulator to control the alternator output. Before studying  this section, a review of transistor principles may be helpful.  

A transistorized voltage regulator consists mainly of  transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, and, usually, a  thermistor. In operation, current flows through a diode  and transistor path to the generator field. When the proper  voltage level is reached, the regulating components  cause the transistor to cut off conduction to control the  alternator field strength. The regulator operating range is  usually adjustable through a narrow range. The thermistor  provides temperature compensation for the circuitry. The  transistorized voltage regulator shown in  Figure 12-342 will be referred to in explaining the operation of this type  of regulator.  

The AC output of the generator is fed to the voltage regulator,  where it is compared to a reference voltage, and the difference  is applied to the control amplifier section of the regulator. If  the output is too low, field strength of the AC exciter generator  is increased by the circuitry in the regulator. If the output is  too high, the field strength is reduced.  

The power supply for the bridge circuit is CR1, which  provides full-wave rectification of the three phase output  from transformer T1. The DC output voltages of CR1 are  proportional to the average phase voltages. Power is supplied  from the negative end of the power supply through point B,  R2, point C, zener diode (CR5), point D, and to the parallel  hookup of V1 and R1. Takeoff point C of the bridge is located  between resistor R2 and the zener diode. In the other leg of  the reference bridge, resistors R9, R7, and the temperature  compensating resistor RT1 are connected in series with V1  and R1 through points B, A, and D. The output of this leg of  the bridge is at the wiper arm of R7.  

As generator voltage changes occur, for example, if the  voltage lowers, the voltage across R1 and V1 (once V2  starts conducting) remains constant. The total voltage change  occurs across the bridge circuit. Since the voltage across the  zener diode remains constant (once it starts conducting), the  total voltage change occurring in that leg of the bridge is  across resistor R2. In the other leg of the bridge, the voltage  change across the resistors is proportional to their resistance  values. Therefore, the voltage change across R2 is greater  than the voltage change across R9 to wiper arm of R7. If  the generator output voltage drops, point C is negative with  respect to the wiper arm of R7. Conversely, if the generator  voltage output increases, the polarity of the voltage between  the two points is reversed.  

The bridge output, taken between points C and A, is  connected between the emitter and the base of transistor  Q1. With the generator output voltage low, the voltage from  the bridge is negative to the emitter and positive to the base.  This is a forward bias signal to the transistor, and the emitter  to collector current therefore increases. With the increase of  current, the voltage across emitter resistor R11 increases.  

This, in turn, applies a positive signal to the base of transistor  

![](images/8c26ee651a6b3981132679d37e6171d19a551fdea9e1b05f8add473c1f85cf83.jpg)

be excited.  

Another item of interest is the line containing resistors R27,  R28, and R29 in series with the normally closed contacts  of the K1 relay. The operating coil of this relay is found in  the lower left part of the schematic. Relay K1 is connected  across the power supply (CR4) for the transistor amplifier.  When the generator is started, electrical energy is supplied  from the 28-volt DC bus to the exciter generator field to  “flash the field” for initial excitation. When the field of the  exciter generator has been energized, the AC generator starts  to produce, and as it builds up, relay K1 is energized, opening  the “field flash” circuit.  

Q4, increasing its emitter to collector current and increasing  the voltage drop across the emitter resistor R10.  

This gives a positive bias to the base of Q2, which increases  its emitter to collector current and increase the voltage drop  across its emitter resistor R4. This positive signal controls  output transistor Q3. The positive signal on the base of Q3  increases the emitter to collector current.  

The control field of the exciter generator is in the collector  circuit. Increasing the output of the exciter generator  increases the field strength of the AC generator, which  increases the generator output.  

To prevent exciting the generator when the frequency is at a  low value, there is an underspeed switch located near the  $\mathrm{F}+$  terminal. When the generator reaches a suitable operating  frequency, the switch closes and allows the generator to

# Chapter 13 Mechanic Privileges & Limitations  

# Introduction  

Since Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 65 was covered only briefly in Chapter 2, Regulations,  Maintenance Forms, Records, and Publications, it is discussed  in greater detail in this chapter. This chapter discusses the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation governing  the certification of airmen other than flight crew members.  This chapter is based on the material contained in 14 CFR  part 65, which has the following subparts:  

•	 Subpart A—General •	 Subpart B—Air Traffic Control Tower Operators •	 Subpart C—Aircraft Dispatchers •	 Subpart D—Mechanics •	 Subpart E—Repairmen •	 Subpart F—Parachute Riggers  

This chapter only focuses on the certification of maintenance  technicians and, therefore, subparts B, C, E, and F are  not addressed.  

The FAA certificates two separate categories of maintenance  technicians: mechanic and repairman. The fundamental  difference between these two is that the mechanic certificate  is transportable, is issued to the technician based upon  their training and knowledge, and is not dependent on the  technician’s location. Although the repairman certificate is  also based upon the training and knowledge of the technician,  it is specifically issued to that technician while they are  employed at a distinct location of a specific company. This  certificate carries a literal address where the technician  is authorized to work using their repairman skills. When  the technician is no longer employed there, the repairman  certificate must be returned to the Flight Standards District  Office (FSDO) that issued it.  

# Mechanic Certification: Subpart A—General  (by 14 CFR Section)  

# Section 65.3, Certification of Foreign Airmen Other  Than Flight Crewmembers  

Normally, the FAA issues these certificates only to United  States (U.S.) citizens or resident aliens residing in the United  States. However, if the FAA determines that the issuance of  a certificate to a person located outside of the United States  is necessary for the operation and continued airworthiness  of a U.S.-registered civil aircraft, it will issue a certificate to  that person, providing they meet the necessary requirements.  

# Section 65.11, Application and Issue  

Any person who meets the criteria for obtaining a mechanic  certificate must apply by means of FAA Form 8610-2, Airman  Certificate and/or Rating Application. If a mechanic has had  a certificate suspended, they may not apply for additional  ratings during the time of suspension. A revocation of a  mechanic certificate prevents that person from applying for  a certificate within a period of 1 year after the revocation.  

# Section 65.12, Offenses Involving Alcohol and  Drugs  

Any person, who has been convicted of violating federal or  state statutes relating to drug offenses, can be denied their  application for a certificate or rating up to 1 year after the date  of conviction. The violation can be relating to any one or more  of the following actions: growing, processing, manufacturing,  selling, disposing, possessing, transporting, or importing  narcotic drugs, marijuana, depressants, or stimulants. They  may also face the suspension or revocation of any certificate  that they currently hold.  

# Section 65.13, Temporary Certificate  

A qualified applicant who successfully passes all required  tests with a minimum score of 70 percent may be issued a  temporary certificate, which is valid for not more than 120  days. During this time, the FAA will review the application  and any supplementary documentation and will issue the  official certificate and rating.  

# Section 65.14, Security Disqualification  

This section was added following the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001. It basically states that anyone determined  by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to be a  security threat will either have their application held if they  are applying for a certificate, or have the certificate that they  do hold revoked.  

# Section 65.15, Duration of Certificates  

Mechanic’s certificates are effective until they are surrendered,  suspended, or revoked. The difference in these terms can be  summarized in the following manner:  

•	 Surrendered means given up voluntarily. •	 Suspended means the FAA temporarily removes the  certificate from the holder. •	 Revoked means the FAA permanently removes the  certificate from the holder.  

# Section 65.16, Change of Name: Replacement of  Lost or Destroyed Certificate  

An application for a change of name on a certificate issued  under this part must be accompanied by the applicant's  current certificate and the marriage license, court order, or  other document verifying the change.  

If the technician changes their name, or is seeking a  replacement certificate, an application must be submitted to  the FAA at the following address:  

Federal Aviation Administration Airmen Certification Branch (AFB-720) P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK 73125  

It should be noted that there is a nominal charge for this service.  

# Section 65.17, Test: General Procedure  

The FAA has designated certain persons to administer  tests associated with obtaining a mechanic certificate. The  minimum passing score for these tests is 70 percent.  

# Section 65.18, Written Tests: Cheating or Other  Unauthorized Content  

If the mechanic or repairmen applicant is determined to be  cheating, or otherwise involved in unauthorized conduct, they  are not eligible for any certificate or rating under this chapter  for a period of 1 year. Furthermore, current ratings the person  already holds may also be suspended or revoked. Examples  of unacceptable conduct for written tests are:  

•	 Copying or intentionally removing the test. •	 Giving or receiving any part of a copy of the test. •	 Giving or receiving help during the test taking period. •	 Take any part of the test on behalf of another person. •	 Using any material or aid during the test taking period  that is not provided by authorized test administrators. •	 Intentionally causing, assisting, or participating in any  of the previous acts.  

# Section 65.19, Retesting After Failure  

Should the mechanic or repairman fail to achieve the required  minimum passing grade, there are two options they may  consider when desiring to apply for retesting:  

•	 Wait a period of 30 days after the date of test failure  and then take the test again. •	 Seek additional instruction in the subject matter  areas failed and provide a signed statement from the  certificated technician providing the instruction stating  the applicant has received necessary instruction and  is ready for testing.  

# Section 65.20, Applications, Certificates, Logbooks,  Reports, and Records: Falsification, Reproduction,  or Alteration  

14 CFR part 43, sections 43.9 and 43.11 define the  requirements for a technician to make appropriate entries  in the maintenance/inspection records for the work  performed. This proper documentation is fundamental to  safe and efficient operation of the U.S. civil aircraft fleet.  Therefore, the FAA takes strong action against those who  would participate in the falsification of those records. The  following actions are the basis for suspending or revoking  any certificate or rating held by the person who:  

•	 Makes fraudulent or intentionally false statement on  an application. •	 Makes fraudulent or intentionally false statement  in any logbook, record, or report required to show  compliance with any certificate requirements. •	 Reproduces a certificate or rating for fraudulent  purposes. •	 Alters any certificate or rating under this part.  

# Section 65.21, Change of Address  

If the technician changes their address, the FAA (at the  address shown below) must be notified in writing within 30  days after the change of permanent residence:  

Federal Aviation Administration Airmen Certification Branch (AFB-720) P.O. Box 25082 Oklahoma City, OK 73125  

# Refusal to Submit to a Drug or Alcohol Test  

Any technician who refuses to submit to a drug test, which  is required by 14 CFR part 120, section 120.15, is subject  to denial by the FAA of any application for additional  certification or ratings, as well as suspension or revocation  of any existing certificate or rating they currently hold. Part  120, section 120.117, Implementing a Drug Testing Program,  requires a urine sample from the employee. Part 120, section  120.37, Misuse of Alcohol, requires that the employee  submit to a breath test. Each section contains a “Definitions”  section and a section titled “Employees who must be tested.”  Persons involved with “Aircraft maintenance or preventative  maintenance duties” are listed in both sections. There are  various types (or rather times) when testing is required:  

•	 Pre-employment •	 Periodic •	 Random •	 Post-accident •	 Testing based upon reasonable cause •	 Return to duty testing •	 Follow-up testing  

The numerous test methods and the harsh penalty imposed  by the FAA on those who involve themselves with these  unauthorized substances or abuse the allowable use of  alcohol indicates the concern that the FAA has for the  possible impairment of technicians. Aviation maintenance  is a professional career choice that demands the highest  caliber technical person to be capable of functioning at their  maximum potential. There is no room in this profession  for a person to be involved with substance abuse. By  doing so, the technician not only endangers themselves,  but their co-workers, and ultimately the customer who is  expecting to have an airworthy aircraft delivered following  a maintenance activity.  

# Mechanic Certification: Subpart D—Mechanics  (by 14 CFR Section)  

# Section 65.71, Eligibility Requirements: General  

The requirements for obtaining a mechanic certificate are:  

•	 Be at least 18 years of age. •	 Be able to read, write, speak, and understand the  English language. ( Note:  If the applicant does not  meet this requirement and is employed outside the  United States by a U.S. carrier, the certificate will be  endorsed “valid only outside the United States.”) •	 Have passed all the required tests (written, oral,  and practical) within the preceding 24 months from  application. •	 Possess and demonstrate the appropriate knowledge  and skill for the certificate rating being sought.  

If a technician has one of the ratings and desires to add the  other, they must meet the requirements set forth in section  65.77, and take the written, oral, and practical tests within  24 months.  

and testing either individually or as a combined certificate.  

Any person holding an aircraft (A) or aircraft engine (E)  certificate prior to June 15, 1952, and which was valid on  that date, may exchange it for the corresponding current  certificate. If both ratings were held, the A & E certificate  may be exchanged for an Airframe and Powerplant (A&P).  

# Section 65.75, Knowledge Requirements  

Any applicant meeting the experience requirements listed  in section 65.77 must pass a written test (minimum passing  score of   $70\%$   as described in section 65.17) covering the  construction and maintenance of aircraft. There are three  separate tests that the applicant for the A&P certificate must  pass: General (60 questions), Airframe (100 questions), and  Powerplant (100 questions). Applicable portions of 14 CFR  43 and 91 are also included in the testing. Basic principles for  the installation and maintenance of propellers are included  with the testing that is administered for the powerplant  rating. Successful completion of the written test is required  before the candidate may apply for the oral and practical  tests identified in section 65.79.  

# Section 65.77, Experience Requirements  

Each mechanic applicant must have a certificate of completion  from a certificated aviation maintenance technician school  (AMTS) (14 CFR part 147) or provide documented evidence  of a minimum of 18 months practical experience related  to either airframe or powerplant maintenance (30 months  required if applying for certification for both airframe and  powerplant).  

# Section 65.79, Skill Requirements  

Oral and practical tests to determine the applicant’s basic  knowledge and skills necessary for the certificate or rating  sought are required to be completed after the applicant has  successfully completed the written test. The practical test  additionally requires minor repairs and minor alterations to  propellers to be demonstrated as part of the powerplant rating.  To assist the applicant, the Aviation Mechanic Practical  Test Standards (PTS) have been published by the FAA to  provide standards for testing in which the applicant for the  A&P certificate should be familiar. The Aviation Mechanic  PTS include the subject areas of knowledge and skill for  the issuance of an aviation mechanic certificate and/or the  addition of a rating. The subject areas are the topics in which  aviation mechanic applicants must have knowledge and/or  demonstrate skill. The PTSs are available on the FAA website  at www.faa.gov.  

# Section 65.73, Ratings  

The FAA recognizes two ratings: airframe and powerplant.  These may be attained by a person upon successful application  

# Section 65.80, Certificated Aviation Maintenance Technician School Students  

Whenever satisfactory evidence is shown to the FAA that a  student enrolled in an aviation maintenance technician school  (certificated under part 147) is making satisfactory progress,  that student may take the oral and practical tests required  by section 65.79, prior to completing the school’s approved  curriculum (as required by section 65.77) and prior to taking  the written test required by section 65.75.  

# Section 65.81, General Privileges and Limitations  

Once a technician becomes a certificated mechanic, they  may perform or supervise the maintenance, preventive  maintenance, or alterations of an aircraft or appliance (or  part thereof) for which they are rated. However, they are  not permitted to perform major repair or major alterations  to propellers nor accomplish any repair to or alteration of  instruments. These activities are reserved for certificated  repairmen at an authorized repair station. Also, they may  not supervise the maintenance, preventive maintenance,  or alteration of any aircraft or appliance (or part thereof)  for which they are rated, unless they have satisfactorily  performed this work at an earlier date. This is where the  benefit of keeping an on the job training (OJT) log cannot be  overemphasized. Whether the technician attends a part 147  maintenance training school or receives the required number  of months as practical experience, they have only scratched  the surface of the tremendously complex world of aviation  maintenance. The technician must either work with someone  (like a shop mentor) or must perform the task satisfactorily  for the FAA. The certified mechanic must have and be able to  comprehend the maintenance manuals and/or instructions for  continued airworthiness for the task they are accomplishing.  

# Section 65.83, Recent Experience Requirements  

In addition to having the proper documentation, the mechanic  is required by this regulation to have recent and relevant  work experience. Although, as it was stated earlier in this  chapter, the A&P certificate is valid until it is surrendered,  suspended, or revoked, it may not be exercised if the holder  has not been actively working as a mechanic for at least 6 of  the preceding 24 months.  

This activity can be any one or a combination of the  following:  

•	 Served as a mechanic under the certificate and rating •	 Technically supervised other mechanics •	 Supervised (in an executive capacity) the maintenance  or alteration of an aircraft  

# Section 65.85, Airframe Rating: Additional Privileges  

A mechanic who holds an airframe rating may approve and  return to service an airframe, an appliance, or any related  part after they have performed, supervised, or inspected  minor repairs or alterations. They may also perform the  maintenance actions required for a major repair or alteration,  and should initiate the appropriate form (FAA Form 337,  Major Repair and Alteration) associated with that work.  However, the return to service action must be accomplished  by a certificated A&P technician holding an Inspection  Authorization (IA). (Refer to 14 CFR section 65.95.) The  airframe mechanic is also authorized to perform the 100-hour  inspection (if required per 14 CFR part 91 section 91.409)  on the airframe.  

A certificated mechanic with an airframe rating can approve  and return to service the airframe of an aircraft with a special  airworthiness certificate, in the light-sport category (refer  to 14 CFR part 21, section 21.190) after performing and  inspecting a major repair or major alteration. The work must  have been done on products that are not produced under FAA  approval (i.e., are not type certificated) and must have been  performed in accordance with instructions developed by the  manufacturer or person acceptable to the FAA.  

# Section 65.87, Powerplant Rating: Additional  Privileges  

Similarly, a mechanic holding a powerplant rating has the  same limitations imposed regarding the powerplant and  propeller as the airframe technician has on the airframe  rating. They may perform and return to service minor repairs  or alterations. They may also accomplish the work activities  required for a major repair or alteration, but the work must  be signed off for return to service by an IA. The privilege of  performing a 100-hour inspection (if required by 14 CFR part  91) on a powerplant or propeller is also authorized.  

A certificated mechanic with a powerplant rating can  approve and return to service the powerplant or propeller  of an aircraft with a special airworthiness certificate, in  the light-sport category (refer to 14 CFR part 21, section  21.190) after performing and inspecting a major repair or  major alteration. The work must have been done on products  that are not produced under FAA approval (i.e., are not type  certificated) and must have been performed in accordance  with instructions developed by the manufacturer or person  acceptable to the FAA.  

# Section 65.89, Display of Certificate  

Once a technician receives their mechanic certificate, the  certificate must be kept in the immediate area where they  normally conduct work and exercises the privileges of the  certificate. When requested, the technician is required to  present the certificate for inspection to the FAA, or any  authorized representation from the National Transportation  Safety Board (NTSB), or any federal, state, or local law  enforcement officer.  

# Inspection Authorization (IA) (by 14 CFR  Section)  

# Section 65.91, Inspection Authorization  

An A&P mechanic who has held their certificate for at least  3 years, and has been active for the last 2 years, may submit  application using FAA Form 8610-1, Mechanic’s Application  for Inspection Authorization, to the FAA for consideration  as an IA. In addition to the preceding time requirements, the  IA candidate must have:  

•	 A fixed base of operation where they can be located  in person or by phone during a normal working week  but it need not be the place where they will exercise  their inspection authority. •	 Available equipment, facilities, and inspection  data necessary to properly inspect the airframe,  powerplants, propellers, or any related part or  appliance they are approving for return to service.  

The applicant who meets all the above criteria must then  pass a written test (or computerized version of the test) to  determine their ability to inspect the airworthiness of an  aircraft following either a major repair or alteration action  or the performance of an annual or progressive inspection.  

The minimum passing score for the computer test is 70  percent. If the applicant fails the test, retesting cannot be  attempted until a minimum of 90 days have elapsed from the  failure date. Unlike the A&P test, there is no reduction in this  time if the applicant receives additional training.  

# Section 65.92, Inspection Authorization: Duration  

An IA certificate expires on March 31 of each odd-numbered  year, but may only be exercised during the time the technician  holds a currently effective mechanic certificate. The IA ceases  to be effective if:  

•	 The technician surrenders it, or it is suspended or  revoked. •	 The technician no longer has a fixed base of operations. •	 The technician no longer has the required facilities,  equipment, or inspection data available.  

Whenever the certificate is suspended or revoked, the  technician must return it to the Administrator when requested  by the FAA to do so.  

# Section 65.93, Inspection Authorization: Renewal  

An IA certificate may be renewed in one of the following  ways each year the technician is seeking renewal:  

•	 The performance of at least one annual inspection for  each 90 days the technician has held the IA rating. •	 The performance of the inspections of at least  two major repairs or alterations for each 90 days  the technician has held the IA rating. ( Note:  The  inspections can be counted regardless of the approval  or disapproval of the work.) •	 The performance (or supervision) and approval of at  least one progressive inspection. •	 The attendance and successful completion of a  refresher course (acceptable to the Administrator) that  is at least 8 hours of instruction. This can be either a  single day seminar or a combination of individual  classes acceptable to the Administrator. Some seminars  are sponsored by the FAA FSDO and are free; others  are low cost. Private industry also frequently conducts  one-day sessions and usually charge for their efforts.  Regardless of who is conducting the seminar, it is  usually an excellent way to accomplish renewal, learn  about new issues, and develop a network among peers. •	 Passed an oral test by an FAA inspector to determine  that the applicant's knowledge of applicable regulations  and standards is current.  

Because all IA certificates expire in the first quarter of each  calendar year (March 31), and the regulation states that  anyone holding an IA for less than 90 days need not meet  the preceding renewal requirements, no renewal is required  for someone who received the IA during the first quarter of  the calendar year.  

The technician with IA should note that regulations clearly  state the number of annual inspections (four) and major  repair or alteration inspections (eight) are required for each  90-day period prior to March 31 st . This does not mean in each  previous 90-day period the technician must have conducted  either an annual or two major repair or alteration inspections,  but rather their cumulative number by March 31 st . Therefore,  an IA could actually go 11 months without performing any  inspection activity relative to renewal. Then in March, they  could conduct all four necessary annual inspections, or all  eight 337-related inspections. However, the regulations do  not provide for the mixing of any of these renewal activities  (i.e., two annual inspections and four Major Repair and  Alteration forms).  

Another method of renewal is to meet with the FAA-assigned  FSDO inspector who will determine that the applicant  possesses current knowledge of the applicable regulations  and standards. Although this is often considered the renewal  method of last resort, it should not be considered a negative  experience. If the IA has been performing their activities  in a professional manner throughout the year, this session  can be considered a professional follow-up or consultation.  Proper IA-to-FSDO inspector interaction can be enhanced  with such a meeting.  

# Section 65.95, Inspection Authorization: Privileges  and Limitations  

The IA may perform an annual inspection or perform or  supervise a progressive inspection. They may also approve  for return to service any aircraft-related part or appliance that  has undergone a major repair or alteration (except aircraft  maintained in accordance with a continuous airworthiness  program operated under 14 CFR part 121).  

The IA must keep their certificate available for inspection  by any one of the following persons:  

•	 Aircraft owner •	 A&P technician •	 FAA Administrator •	 Authorized representative of the NTSB •	 Any federal, state, local, or law enforcement officer  

If the holder of an IA moves their fixed base of operation,  they must notify in writing the FSDO responsible for the  location they are moving to before beginning to exercise the  privileges of an IA. Although it is not required, good business  etiquette and professional responsibility would suggest that  a similar letter be written to the responsible FAA Principal  Maintenance Inspector (PMI) at the FSDO in the area they  are leaving.  

# Ethics  

This is a tremendously broad and diverse area of study. It is  also an area that is coming under more scrutiny by consumers,  individual watchdog groups, and government review  committees. Ethics, or more appropriately the lack of ethics,  has caused the loss of millions of dollars through fraudulent  accounting practices, shoddy workmanship, etc. This chapter  examines some definitions of ethics and some examples of  poor business ethics in order to raise the awareness of the  technician to the importance of ethics.  

The word “ethics” is actually a philosophical term that comes  from the Greek word “ethos,” which means character or  custom. So, it is logical that a current definition of ethics  is “the study of standards of conduct and moral judgment.”  Although situations involving questionable ethics can exist  wherever and whenever business decisions are made, the  scope of this discussion is limited to areas with which the  technician is probably associated.  

# A Scenario  

The following incident illustrates one way that both personal  ethics and technician knowledge of regulations can work  together to provide them with the ability to make the right  decision. Unfortunately, others in the shop did not appear as  concerned as the technician sharing the incident.  

A technician working for an airline was involved in a situation  that required a repair or replacement of a fuselage ice  shield. The computer inventory indicated that a replacement  part was in stock, so the technician removed the damaged  component. It was then found that the replacement part was  not actually in stock. At this point, a crucial decision was to  be made: Can the damaged item be reinstalled? The steps in  properly documenting a maintenance event are to record the  removal of the damaged part, then document the installation  of an airworthy part. Once the technician has committed to  removing the damaged part, it becomes unairworthy and  cannot be reinstalled regardless of its deferability in the  minimum equipment list (MEL).  

The actual sequence of events is as follows:  

•	 Significant impact damage to the ice shield was  observed and recorded.  •	 The company inspector reviewed and instructed the  technician to replace the ice shield.  •	 Availability of the replacement part was confirmed by  computer.  •	 The damaged part was removed, and the technician  prepared the surface for the replacement part.  •	 The new part was ordered from inventory, but the part  was not in stock (inventory error).  •	 The inspector instructed the technician to reinstall the  old one.  •	 The technician refused.  •	 The inspector instructed the technician to repair it.  •	 The technician researched the structural repair  manual (SRM) and found that the facility did not  have the proper facility authorization to repair the  damaged part. •	 The company inspector told the technician to apply  5-minute epoxy to the area, sand it down, and paint  it.  

•	 The technician walked away.  •	 The company inspector found someone else to  compromise standards. The aircraft departed on  time—illegally and unairworthy.  

This happens more often than one would like, is probably  overlooked by many people, and, unfortunately, might be  considered standard operating procedure (SOP) for some  maintenance facilities. It is the responsibility of the mechanic  to follow regulations and to question the actions of their  supervisors if the policy is circumvented to make an on-time  departure.  

This incident provides some valuable insights into how day- to-day events can lead to pressure to produce and ultimately  compromise the decision-making.  

1.	 The incident occurred while working for a commercial  airline. The pressure for getting the aircraft in the air  is tremendous in this environment. 2.	 Inventory error added to the pressure. The damaged  part had been removed because the technician  had queried and believed a replacement part was  immediately available.  3.	 The company inspector was either unaware of  regulatory requirements or simply did not care. 4.	 The second technician was either unaware of  regulatory requirements or simply did not care.  

# Final Observation  

The underlying company culture was apparently lacking  concern for ethical decisions and regulatory compliance.  An effective organizational culture should always encourage  ethical behavior and discourage unethical behavior. This  means that not only does the upper management of an  organization say that they conduct themselves ethically,  they must do it consistently; employees, customers, vendors,  and even competitors should know this company has “high  ethical standards.”  

This latter issue may sometimes have painful consequences,  if the businesses are competing for a customer’s business.  The ethical company may estimate the maintenance activities  to take 8 weeks and quotes that time frame to the customer.  The unethical company may also know the work takes 8  weeks, but tells the customer only 6 weeks, hoping to get  the job. Once the plane is “captured” and maintenance has  begun, explanations and excuses extend the original time  estimate of 6 weeks to the actual 8 weeks or longer. Although  the customer would be disappointed in this situation, few  customers would be able to remove an aircraft undergoing  maintenance. This “bait and switch” tactic is often used by  unscrupulous companies to get an aircraft into their shop no  matter what it takes. Although the shop’s retention of clients is  frequently very low, there always seem to be new ones willing  to accept a shorter-than-normal turnaround time quote. Often  these same shops underbid the job, and then continually  add extra costs as the work progresses. The technician is  encouraged to avoid employment at maintenance facilities  that do not think twice about trying to deceive the customer.  

Since companies are usually in business to make money, the  “bottom line” mentality frequently drives management and,  ultimately, technician decisions. But short-term, quick-fix  solutions that focus only on immediate financial success  promote the idea that everything boils down to monetary  gain. Ethical behavior is not about monetary gain.  

In addition to monetary gain, there are other common ways  that unethical behavior is rationalized:  

•	 Pretending that the behavior is not unethical or illegal. •	 Excusing the behavior by saying it is really in the  organization’s (or the technician’s) best interest. •	 Assuming the behavior is okay, because no one else  would even be expected to find out about it. •	 Expecting your superiors to support and protect you  if anything should go wrong (Gellerman 1986).  

This latter point often leads to a significant surprise for the  individual technician if they compromised their standards  at the encouragement of management to get the job done.  Should there be a problem with maintenance and subsequent  airworthiness of the aircraft, the very same managers or  superiors who directed that technician to shortcut proper  maintenance procedures would testify in court that they  always encouraged their employees to work “by the book”  and never encouraged unauthorized shortcuts.  

Ultimately, every organization establishes a climate or  culture regarding honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior.  This corporate climate sets the tone for decision making at  all levels and in all circumstances. This leads to the second  business example, the Aircraft Brake Scandal. Although this  incident occurred at the B.F. Goodrich Wheel and Brake  Plant in Troy, Ohio, and is therefore focused on the design,  manufacture, and test of wheels and brakes for the U.S. Air  Force A-7D, it is a classic case of both personal ethics and  “whistle blowing.” A brief review of the pertinent facts in  the incident follows.  

A young engineering technician is in charge of conducting  the required qualification testing for a newly designed  brake and rotor system awarded to the B.F. Goodrich Co.  by L.T.V. Aerospace. An aggressive time schedule and an  upper management mindset of not wanting to hear bad news  (i.e., the brakes are failing test), a senior engineer who is not  willing to have their computations challenged, and a project  manager who states the brake will be qualified “no matter  what,” ultimately lead to a congressional oversight hearing  in 1969. Along the way, the brake system is tested (and fails  14 times), no one wants to write the required test report, low  level employees seek legal advice, and the aircraft suffers  serious damage during landing while conducting initial  flight testing due to unsatisfactory braking. (The reader is  encouraged to look up this now famous case on the Internet  to obtain more details.)  

Some of the ethical conflicts that are evident in this situation  are:  

•	 Young engineer (newly hired) feels intimidated by  senior level engineer. •	 Early brake failure during development testing is  excused away because “they are not representative  of the final design.” •	 A company culture of intimidation and distrust.  

Most of these conflicts could have easily occurred in the  maintenance realm if the specifics are broadened, even a little.  

•	 Change the word “engineer” to “maintenance  technician.” •	 Instead of brake failure during development testing,  think of component test failure (with the shop norm  of “we don’t follow the manual on this step; we have  developed our own (unauthorized) procedure here.”)  •	 The existence of a company culture of intimidation  and distrust transcends all lines of business.  

For a company to nurture a healthy ethical climate and long- term success, the element of trust is fundamental both inside  and outside the organization. This trust boosts employee  morale and usually boosts productivity and, therefore,  profitability. It also aids and enhances long-term business  relationships with customers and vendors.  

When differences of opinion do exist, ethical organizations  pay close attention to those who are dissenting. Those  companies that are committed to promoting an ethical climate  encourage rather than punish dialogue and debate about  policies and practices.  

It is encouraging to note that more and more institutions of  learning, whether business schools or technical colleges, are  adding ethics courses into their required curriculum. More  and more organizations are developing a corporate “code of  ethics.” Some are using the following seven-step checklist  to help employees deal with an ethical decision:  

1.	 Recognize and clarify the dilemma. 2.	 Get all the possible facts. 3.	 List options—all of them. 4.	 Test each option by asking such questions as: —Is it legal? —Is it right? —Is it beneficial? 5.	 Make your decision. 6.	 Double check your decision by asking: —How would I feel if my family found out about this? —How would I feel if my decision is printed in the  local newspaper? 7.	 Take action (Schermerhorn 1989).  

Finally, the technician is encouraged to read the following code  of ethics developed by Professional Aviation Maintenance  Association (PAMA), Inc. and consider adopting it as their  own.  

“As a certified technician, my performance is a public service  and, as such, I have a responsibility to the United States  Government and its citizens. I must ensure that all citizens  have confidence in my integrity, and that I will perform my  work according to the highest principles of ethical conduct.  Therefore, I swear that I shall hold in sacred trust the rights  and privileges conferred upon me as a certified technician.  The safety and lives of others are dependent on my skill and  judgment; therefore, I shall never knowingly subject others  to risks which I would not be willing to assume for myself  or those who are dear to me.”  

“As a certified technician, I am aware that it is not possible  to have knowledge and skill in every aspect of aviation  maintenance for every airplane, so I pledge that I will never  undertake work or approve work which I believe to be beyond  the limits of my knowledge. I shall not allow any superior to  persuade me to approve aircraft or equipment as airworthy  when there is doubt in my mind as to the validity of my action.  Under no circumstances will I permit the offer of money or  other personal favors to influence me to act contrary to my  best judgment, nor to pass as airworthy aircraft or equipment  about which I am in doubt.”  

“The responsibility that I have accepted as a certified  technician demands that I exercise my judgment on the  airworthiness of aircraft and equipment; therefore, I pledge  unyielding adherence to these precepts for the advancement  of aviation and for the dignity of my vocation.”  

# Chapter 14 Human Factors  

# Introduction  

# FAA Involvement  

The FAA has had a formal involvement in this issue since  1988. That was the year the first Human Factors Issues in  Aviation Maintenance and Inspection National Conference  was conducted, and that effort reflects a working relationship  between government research and industry activity. This  yearly event includes airlines, suppliers, manufacturers,  schools, and government agencies. There is also an FAA  website for human factors at  hf.faa.gov  which is a tremendous  resource.  

# Importance of Human Factors  

The greatest impact in aircraft safety in the future will  not come from improving the technology. Rather it will  be from educating the employee to recognize and prevent  human error. A review of accident related data indicates that  approximately 75–80 percent of all aviation accidents are the  result of human error. Of those accidents,  about 12 percent  are maintenance related . Although pilot/co-pilot errors tend  to have immediate and highly visible effects, maintenance  errors tend to be more latent and less obvious. However, they  can be just as lethal.  

# Definitions of Human Factors  

Human factors are concerned with optimizing performance  … including reducing errors so that the highest level of safety  is achieved and maintained.  

—Ron LoFaro, PhD  

Human factors is the study of how people interact with their  environments.  

—FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  

Human factors are those elements that affect our behavior  and performance, especially those that may cause us to make  errors.  

—Canadian Department of Defense (video)  

Our focus is on human factors as it relates to improper actions.  Note, however, that human factors exist in both proper and  improper actions.  [Figure 14-1]  Since improper actions  usually result in human error, we should also define that term.  

Human error is the unintentional act of performing a task  incorrectly that can potentially degrade the system. There  are three types of human error:  

1.	 Omission:  not performing an act or task. 2.	 Commission:  accomplishing a task incorrectly. 3.	 Extraneous:  performing a task not authorized.  

There are also four consequences of human error:  

1.	 Little or no effect. 2.	 Damage to equipment/hardware. 3.	 Personal injury. 4.	 Catastrophic.  

Why are human conditions, such as fatigue, complacency,  and stress, so important in aviation maintenance? These  conditions, along with many others, are called human  factors. Human factors directly cause or contribute to many  aviation accidents. It is universally agreed that 80 percent  of maintenance errors involve human factors. If they are not  detected, they can cause events, worker injuries, wasted time,  and even accidents.  [Figure 14-2]  

Aviation safety relies heavily on maintenance. When it is  not done correctly, it contributes to a significant proportion  of aviation accidents and incidents. Some examples of  maintenance errors are parts installed incorrectly, missing  parts, and necessary checks not being performed. In  comparison with many other threats to aviation safety, the  mistakes of an aviation maintenance technician (AMT) can be  more difficult to detect. Often, these mistakes are present but  not visible and have the potential to remain latent, affecting  the safe operation of aircraft for extended periods of time.  

AMTs are confronted with a set of human factors unique  within aviation. They can be working in the evening or early  morning hours, in confined spaces, on high platforms, and in a  variety of adverse temperature/humidity conditions. The work  can be physically strenuous, yet it also requires attention to  detail.  [Figure 14-3]  Because of the nature of maintenance  tasks, AMTs commonly spend more time preparing for a  task than actually carrying it out. Proper documentation of  all maintenance work is a key element, and AMTs typically  spend as much time updating maintenance logs as they do  performing the work.  [Figure 14-4]  

Human factors awareness can lead to improved quality, an  environment that ensures continuing worker and aircraft  safety, and a more involved and responsible work force.  The reduction of even minor errors can provide measurable  benefits including cost reductions, fewer missed deadlines,  reduction in work related injuries, reduction of warranty  claims, and reduction in more significant events that can be  traced back to maintenance error. Within this chapter, the  many aspects of human factors are discussed in relation to  aviation maintenance. The most common human factors are  introduced along with ways to mitigate the risk to stop them  from developing into a problem. Several Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) human factor resources are provided,  including a direct link to aviation maintenance human factors  are at  hf.faa.gov .  

# What are Human Factors?  

The term “human factors” has grown increasingly popular  as the commercial aviation industry realizes that human  error, rather than mechanical failure, underlies most  aviation accidents and incidents. Human factors science  or technologies are multidisciplinary fields incorporating  contributions from psychology, engineering, industrial  design, statistics, operations research, and anthropometry. It is  a term that covers the science of understanding the properties  of human capability, the application of this understanding  to the design, development, and deployment of systems  and services, and the art of ensuring successful application  of human factor principles into the maintenance working  environment.  

The spectrum of human factors that can affect aviation  maintenance and work performance is broad. They  encompass a wide range of challenges that influence  people very differently as humans do not all have the  same capabilities, strengths, weaknesses, or limitations.  Unfortunately, aviation maintenance tasks that do not take  into account the vast amount of human limitations can result  in technical error and injuries.   Figure 14-5  shows some of  the human factors that affect AMTs. Some are more serious  than others but, in most cases, when you combine three or  four of the factors, they create a problem that contributes to  an accident or incident.  

# Elements of Human Factors  

Human factors are comprised of many disciplines.  This section discusses ten of those disciplines: Clinical  Psychology, Experimental Psychology, Anthropometrics,  Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Safety Engineering,  Medical Science, Organizational Psychology, Educational  Psychology, and Industrial Engineering.  [Figure 14-6]  

The study and application of human factors is complex  because there is not just one simple answer to fix or  change how people are affected by certain conditions or  situations. The overall goal of aviation maintenance human  factors research is to identify and optimize the factors that  affect human performance in maintenance and inspection.

![](images/8686a6376cb74d7f8feb93251e69f989a86bb5e72b2bdcaa3e1339bec897c49d.jpg)  
Figure 14-2.  Human factors and how they affect people are very  important to aviation maintenance.  

The focus initiates on the technician but extends to the  entire engineering and technical organization. Research is  optimized by incorporating the many disciplines that affect  human factors in an effort to understand how people can work  more efficiently and maintain work performance.  

By understanding each of the disciplines and applying them  to different situations or human behaviors, we can correctly  recognize potential human factors and address them before  they develop into a problem or create a chain of problems  that result in an accident or incident.  

# Clinical Psychology  

Clinical psychology includes the study and application of  psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and  relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction and  to promote subjective well-being and personal development.  It focuses on the mental well-being of the individual. Clinical  psychology can help individuals deal with stress, coping  mechanisms for adverse situations, poor self-image, and  accepting criticism from coworkers.  

# Experimental Psychology  

Experimental psychology includes the study of a variety of  basic behavioral processes, often in a laboratory environment.  These processes may include learning, sensation, perception,  human performance, motivation, memory, language,  

![](images/bc2dd96c1f509c7465c99e9c67e98ec71d825a685cdeda1e1f5bfe6237ab0c5a.jpg)

thinking, and communication, as well as the physiological  processes underlying behaviors, such as eating, reading, and  problem solving. In an effort to test the efficiency of work  policies and procedures, experimental studies help measure  performance, productivity, and deficiencies.  

# Anthropometry  

Anthropometry is the study of the dimensions and abilities of  the human body. This is essential to aviation maintenance due  to the environment and spaces that AMTs have to work with.  For example, a man who is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 230  pounds may be required to fit into a small crawl space of an  aircraft to conduct a repair. Another example is the size and  weight of equipment and tools. Men and women are generally  on two different spectrums of height and weight. Although  both are equally capable of completing the same task with a  high level of proficiency, someone who is smaller may be able  to perform more efficiently with tools and equipment tailored  to their size. In other words, one size does not fit all and the  term “average person” does not apply when employing such  a diverse group of people.  

# Computer Science  

The technical definition for computer science is the study of  the theoretical foundations of information and computation  and of practical techniques for their implementation and  application in computer systems. Yet how this relates to  aviation maintenance is simpler to explain. As mentioned  earlier, AMTs spend as much time documenting repairs  as they do performing them. It is important that they have  computer work stations that are comfortable and reliable.  Software programs and computer-based test equipment  should be easy to learn and use, and not intended only for  those with a high levels of computer literacy.  

# Cognitive Science  

Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of  minds as information processors. It includes research on how  information is processed (in faculties such as perception,  language, reasoning, and emotion), represented, and  transformed in a nervous system or machine (e.g., computer).  It spans many levels of analysis from low-level learning  and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning.  AMTs must possess a great ability to problem solve quickly  and efficiently. They are constantly required to troubleshoot  situations and quickly react to them. This can be a vicious  cycle creating an enormous amount of stress. The discipline  of cognitive science helps us understand how to better assist  AMTs during situations that create high levels of stress so  that their mental process does not get interrupted and affect  their ability to work.  

# Safety Engineering  

Safety engineering ensures that a life-critical system  behaves as needed even when the component fails. Ideally,  safety engineers take an early design of a system, analyze  it to find what faults can occur, and then propose safety  requirements in design specifications up front and changes  to existing systems to make the system safer. Safety cannot  be stressed enough when it comes to aviation maintenance,  and everyone deserves to work in a safe environment.  Safety engineering plays a big role in the design of aviation  maintenance facilities, storage containers for toxic materials,  equipment used for heavy lifting, and floor designs to ensure  no one slips, trips, or falls. In industrial work environments,  the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) are important.  

# Medical Science  

Medicine is the science and art of healing. It encompasses  a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and  restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness.  Disposition and physical well-being are very important and  directly correlated to human factors.  Just like people come  in many shapes and sizes, they also have very different  reactions to situations due to body physiology, physical  structures, and biomechanics.  

# Organizational Psychology  

Organizational psychologists are concerned with relations  between people and work. Their interests include  organizational structure and organizational change, workers’  productivity and job satisfaction, consumer behavior,  and the selection, placement, training, and development  of personnel. Understanding organizational psychology  helps aviation maintenance supervisors learn about the  points listed below that, if exercised, can enhance the work  environment and productivity.  

•	 Rewards and compensations for workers with good  

![](images/04304fdfd97e3683d1ae445341191f13738e5fec6dbde58cf224b583d69cfe28.jpg)

safety records. •	 Motivation for workers to want to do well and work  safely. •	 Unifying work teams and groups so they get along  and work together to get the job done right. •	 Treating all workers equally.  

# Educational Psychology  

Educational psychologists study how people learn and  design the methods and materials used to educate people of  all ages. Everyone learns differently and at a different pace.  Supervisors should design blocks of instruction that relate  to a wide variety of learning styles.  

# Industrial Engineering  

Industrial engineering is the organized approach to the study  of work. It is important for supervisors to set reasonable work  standards that can be met and exceeded. Unrealistic work  standards create unnecessary stressors that cause mistakes.  It is also beneficial to have an efficient facility layout so that  there is room to work. Clean and uncluttered environments  enhance work performance. Another aspect of industrial  engineering that helps in the understanding of human factors  is the statistical analysis of work performance. Concrete data  of work performance, whether good or bad, can show the  contributing factors that may have been present when the  work was done.

Figure 14-6.  Human factor disciplines.  

# History of Human Factors  

Around 1487, Leonardo da Vinci began research in the  area of anthropometrics. The Vitruvian Man, one of his  most famous drawings, can be described as one of the  earliest sources presenting guidelines for anthropometry.  [Figure 14-7]  Around the same time, he also began to  study the flight of birds. He grasped that humans are too  heavy and not strong enough to fly using wings simply  attached to the arms. Therefore, he sketched a device in  which the aviator lies down on a plank and works two large,  membranous wings using hand levers, foot pedals, and a  system of pulleys.  [Figure 14-8]  Today, anthropometry plays  a considerable role in the fields of computer design, design  for access and maintainability, simplicity of instructions, and  ergonomic issues.  

In the early 1900s, industrial engineers Frank and Lillian  Gilbreth were trying to reduce human error in medicine.  [Figures 14-9  and  14-10]  They developed the concept of  using call backs when communicating in the operating  room. For example, the doctor says “scalpel” and the nurse  repeats “scalpel” and then hands it to the doctor. That is  called the challenge-response system. Speaking out loud  reinforces what tool is needed and provides the doctor with an  opportunity to make corrections if it is not the necessary tool.  This same verbal protocol is used in aviation today. Pilots  are required to read back instructions or clearances given by  air traffic control (ATC) to ensure that the pilot receives the  correct instructions and gives ATC an opportunity to correct  if the information is wrong. Frank and Lillian Gilbreth also  are known for their research on fatigue.  

Also in the early 1900s, Orville and Wilbur Wright were  the first to fly a powered aircraft and also pioneered many  human factors considerations. While others were trying  to develop aircraft with a high degree of aerodynamic  stability, the Wrights intentionally designed unstable aircraft  with cerebralized control modeled after the flight of birds.  Between 1901 and 1903, the brothers worked with large  gliders at Kill Devil Hills, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,  to develop the first practical human interactive controls for  aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw. On December 17, 1903, they  made four controlled powered flights over the dunes at  Kitty Hawk with their Wright Flyer.  [Figure 14-11]  They  later developed practical in-flight control of engine power,  plus an angle of attack sensor and stick pusher that reduced  pilot workload. The brothers’ flight demonstrations in the  United States and Europe during 1908-1909 awakened the  world to the new age of controlled flight. Orville was the first  aviator to use a seat belt and also introduced a rudder boost/ trim control that gave the pilot greater control authority. The  Wrights’ flight training school in Dayton, Ohio included a  flight simulator of their own design. The Wrights patented  their practical airplane and flight control concepts, many of  which are still in use today.  

Prior to World War I, the only test of human to machine  compatibility was that of trial and error. If the human  functioned with the machine, he was accepted, if not he was  rejected. There was a significant change in the concern for  humans during the American Civil War. The U.S. Patent  Office was concerned about whether the mass-produced  uniforms and new weapons could be used effectively by the  infantry men.  

# Evolution of Maintenance Human Factors  

With the onset of World War I (1914–1918), more  sophisticated equipment was being developed and the  inability of personnel to use such systems led to an increased  interest in human capability. Up to this point, the focus of  aviation psychology was on the pilot, but as time progressed,  the focus shifted onto the aircraft. Of particular concern  was the design of the controls and displays, the effects of  altitude, and environmental factors on the pilot. The war  also brought on the need for aeromedical research and the  need for testing and measurement methods.  By the end of  World War I, two aeronautical labs were established, one at  Brooks Air Force Base, Texas, and the other at Wright Field  outside of Dayton, Ohio.  

Another significant development was in the civilian sector,  where the effects of illumination on worker productivity were  examined. This led to the identification of the Hawthorne  Effect, which suggested that motivational factors could  significantly influence human performance.  

With the onset of World War II (1939–1945), it was becoming  increasingly harder to match individuals to pre-existing jobs.  Now the design of equipment had to take into account human  limitations and take advantage of human capabilities. This  change took time as there was a lot of research still to be  done to determine the human capabilities and limitations. An  example of this is the 1947 study done by Fitts and Jones on  the most effective configuration of control knobs to be used  in aircraft flight decks. Much of this research transitioned  into other equipment with the aim of making the controls  and displays easier for the operators to use.  

Unfortunately, all the “lessons learned” in the WWII studies  of group dynamics, and flight crew communication were  seemingly forgotten after the war. Post WWII aircrew studies  continued to focus primarily on flight crews, especially pilot  selection, simulator training, and cockpit layout and design.  

Subsequent studies of the technician focused on individual  competency and included equipment design (ergonomics).

The Vietnam Conflict brought the quest for greater safety,  and with that, came a systematic approach for error reduction.  This increased attention brought both good and bad changes.  It led to the “Zero Defects” quality programs in maintenance  and manufacturing. Generally, this had a positive effect.  However, it also led to “crackdown programs” which were  one-way communication from management (the infamous  “my way or the highway” approach). This concept is more  

![](images/bddec43d30e5b4237e7a8a00f9bc7ed24582f3b235fe12194b9820c9d851a914.jpg)

dictatorial than democratic, and typically had a long-term  negative effect on the company. This “crackdown” approach  for behavior control is based upon fear and punishment,  which creates a problem. Errors are driven into hiding,  

![](images/aa9e5e95a6ad16aa7b30919bb5e098c4e7de027c7dfd0f88a8d0b84bacd28fcd.jpg)

and then become apparent later, usually at a more critical  time (“Murphy’s Law”). Additional attempts to develop  “foolproof” equipment designs were added to the zero-defect  manufacturing goal and began to find recognition in the  maintenance world as well. Subsequent efforts focused on  effects of positive rather than negative motivators. The results  of this effort were a reversal of the “crackdown” method,  and motivation due to increased morale often improved  maintenance safety performance. Studies have shown that  motivation resulting from negative sources seldom achieved  the same effect. This led to a “Participative Management”  style recognized by some U.S. industry and a few airlines,  but did not reach maintenance operations until much later.  

The Airline Deregulation (1978 –1988) effort had a profound  effect upon the aviation community. Prior to 1978, the  airline industry was regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Act  of 1938. This resulted in peaceful markets, stable routes,  and consistent air fares. However, there was a downside  consisting of two major problems: wasteful management  practices and excessively high wages compared to other  comparable skilled-labor industries. The Airline Deregulation  Act brought in competitive business practices, with routes  and fares controlled by their profitability. This led to a new  style of airline management in which a CEO was more of a  business person and less knowledgeable of aviation. Existing  airlines developed new routes and added new kinds of service  and style. Start-up airlines brought other innovative ideas.  The numerous mergers and acquisitions added an increasing  pressure to focus on the financial bottom line. Doing more  with less became the byline. In the 1980s, maintenance  departments were not immune to the pressures of mergers  and staff reductions. However, fleets were extremely  reliable at that time, and significant savings were aided by a  reduction in number of maintenance technicians. Other new  ways of conducting business included leasing of aircraft  and outsourcing of maintenance. A result of deregulation  was change for the maintenance programs (both personnel  and departmental) and the pressure to produce and adjust.  The problem, however, was that human factors for aviation  maintenance was still stuck in the 1960s model.  

![](images/1430fc42fd48dbb8d039ec91eb1bd3e3b8061d5c9269350e43aca41c4990f5e0.jpg)  
Figure 14-11.  The Wright Brothers on December 17, 1903, flying  over the dunes at Kitty Hawk with their Wright Flyer.  

A detailed review of aviation literature published between  1976 and 1987 had very little to say about maintenance. Out  of 50 published articles, only 15 even mention maintenance.  Most of these articles deal with ergonomics, one article  examines military engine design to “solider proof” the  maintenance duties, and one U.S. Navy article advocated  more management control.  

As human factors awareness progressed, a “culture change”  occurred in U.S. carriers in the 1990s. Management  behavior began to change; there were practical applications  of systems thinking; organization structure was revised;  and new strategy, policy, and values emerged. Virtually  all of these involved communication and collaboration.  One example is in 1991, when Continental Airlines began  “CRM type” training in maintenance. They saw the  importance of improving communication, teamwork, and  participative decision making. A second example is when  United Airlines instituted a change in organization and the  job of design of inspectors. They remained more accessible  during heavy maintenance and overhaul and stayed in closer  communication with mechanics during normal repairs.  This resulted in fewer turnbacks and higher quality. A third  example is when Southwest Airlines created and sustained a  strong and clear organizational structure led by the CEO. This  resulted in open and positive communication between the  maintenance and other departments. A final example is when  TWA instituted a new program to improve communication  between the maintenance trade union and maintenance  management. This resulted in improved quality.  

# The Pear Model  

There are many concepts related to the science and practice  of human factors. However, from a practical standpoint, it is  most helpful to have a unified view, or a model of the things  we should be concerned about when considering aviation  maintenance human factors. For more than a decade, the term  “PEAR” has been used as a memory jogger, or mnemonic,  to characterize human factors in aviation maintenance.  The PEAR mode prompts recall of the four important  considerations for human factors programs, which are listed  below.  

•	 People who do the job. •	 Environment in which they work. •	 Actions they perform. •	 Resources necessary to complete the job.  

# People  

Aviation maintenance human factors programs focus on  the people who perform the work and address physical,  physiological, psychological, and psychosocial factors.  [Figure 14-12]  The programs must focus on individuals, their  physical capabilities, and the factors that affect them. They  also should consider their mental state, cognitive capacity,  and conditions that may affect their interaction with others. In  most cases, human factors programs are designed around the  people in the company’s existing workforce. You cannot apply  identical strength, size, endurance, experience, motivation,  and certification standards equally to all employees. The  company must match the physical characteristics of each  person to the tasks each performs.  

The company must consider factors like each person’s size,  strength, age, eyesight, and more to ensure each person is  physically capable of performing all the tasks making up the  job. A good human factors program considers the limitations  of humans and designs the job accordingly. An important  element when incorporating human factors into job design is  planned rest breaks. People can suffer physical and mental  fatigue under many work conditions. Adequate breaks and rest  periods ensure the strain of the task does not overload their  capabilities. Another “People” consideration, which also is  related to “E” for “Environment,” is ensuring there is proper  lighting for the task, especially for older workers. Annual  vision testing and hearing exams are excellent proactive  interventions to ensure optimal human physical performance.  

Attention to the individual does not stop at physical abilities.  A good human factors program must address physiological  and psychological factors that affect performance. Companies  should do their best to foster good physical and mental health.  Offering educational programs on health and fitness is one  way to encourage good health. Many companies have reduced  sick leave and increased productivity by making healthy  meals, snacks, and drinks available to their employees.  Companies also should have programs to address issues  associated with chemical dependence, including tobacco  and alcohol. Another “People” issue involves teamwork  and communication. Safe and efficient companies find ways  to foster communication and cooperation among workers,  managers, and owners. For example, workers should be  rewarded for finding ways to improve the system, eliminate  waste, and help ensure continuing safety.  

# Environment  

There are at least two environments in aviation maintenance.  There is the physical workplace on the ramp, in the hangar,  or in the shop. In addition, there is the organizational  environment that exists within the company. A human  factors program must pay attention to both environments.  [Figure 14-13]  

# Physical  

The physical environment is obvious. It includes ranges of  temperature, humidity, lighting, noise control, cleanliness,  and workplace design. Companies must acknowledge  these conditions and cooperate with the workforce to either  accommodate or change the physical environment. It takes a  corporate commitment to address the physical environment.  This topic overlaps with the “Resources” component of  PEAR when it comes to providing portable heaters, coolers,  lighting, clothing, and good workplace and task design.  

# Organizational  

The second, less tangible, environment is the organizational  one. The important factors in an organizational environment  are typically related to cooperation, communication, shared  values, mutual respect, and the culture of the company.  An excellent organizational environment is promoted with  leadership, communication, and shared goals associated with  safety, profitability, and other key factors. The best companies  guide and support their people and foster a culture of safety. A  safe culture is one where there is a shared value and attitude  toward safety. In a safe culture, each person understands  their individual role is contributing to overall mission safety.  

# Actions  

Successful human factors programs carefully analyze all the  actions people must perform to complete a job efficiently  and safely. Job task analysis (JTA) is the standard human  factors approach to identify the knowledge, skills, and  attitudes necessary to perform each task in a given job.  The JTA helps identify what instructions, tools, and other  resources are necessary. Adherence to the JTA helps ensure  each worker is properly trained and each workplace has the  necessary equipment and other resources to perform the  job. Many regulatory authorities require that the JTA serve  as the basis for the company’s general maintenance manual  and training plan. Many human factors challenges associated  with use of job cards and technical documentation fall under  “Actions.” Clearly understandable documentation of actions  ensures instructions and checklists are correct and useable.  [Figure 14-14]  

# Resources  

The final PEAR letter is “R” for “Resources.”  [Figure 14-15]  It is sometimes difficult to separate resources from the  other elements of PEAR. In general, the characteristics of  the people, environment, and actions dictate the resources.  Many resources are tangible, such as lifts, tools, test  equipment, computers, technical manuals, and so forth. Other  resources are less tangible. Examples include the number  and qualifications of staff to complete a job, the amount of  time allocated, and the level of communication among the  crew, supervisors, vendors, and others. Resources should be  viewed (and defined) from a broad perspective. A resource  is anything a technician (or anyone else) needs to get the job  done. For example, protective clothing is a resource. A mobile  phone can be a resource. Rivets can be resources. What is  important to the “Resource” element in PEAR is focusing  on identifying the need for additional resources.  

Another major human factors tool for use in investigation of  maintenance problems is the Boeing developed Maintenance  Error Decision Aid (MEDA). This is based on the idea that  errors result from a series of factors or incidents. The goal of  using MEDA is to investigate errors, understand root causes,  and prevent accidents, instead of simply placing blame on the  maintenance personnel for the errors. Traditional efforts to  investigate errors are often designed to identify the employee  who made the error. In this situation, the actual factors that  

![](images/8979be9bc3d8b7fb646040f61e05a9a3dd9374f50e6da34d6e84d9e37d8506ba.jpg)  

contributed to the errors or accident remain unchanged, and  the mistake is likely to recur. In an effort to break this “blame  and train” cycle, MEDA investigators learn to look for the  factors that contributed to the error, instead of the employee  who made the error. The MEDA concept is based on the  following three principles:  

•	 Positive employee intent (In other words, maintenance  technicians want to do the best job possible and do  not make intentional errors.) •	 Contribution of multiple factors (There is often a series  of factors that contribute to an error.) •	 Manageability of errors (Most of the factors that  contribute to an error can be managed.)  

When a company is willing to adopt these principles, then the  MEDA process can be implemented to help the maintenance  organization achieve the dual goals of identifying those  factors that contribute to existing errors, and avoiding future  errors. In creating this five-step process, Boeing initially  worked with British Airways, Continental Airlines, United  Airlines, a maintenance worker labor union, and the FAA.  The five steps are:  

1.	 Event:  the maintenance organization must select  which error that caused events will be investigated. 2.	 Decision:  was the event maintenance related? If the  answer is yes, then the MEDA investigation continues. 3.	 Investigation:  using the MEDA results form,  the operator conducts an investigation to record  general information about the airplane—when the  maintenance and the event occurred, what event  initiated the investigation, the error that caused the  event, the factors contributing to the error, and a list  of possible presentation strategies.  

4.	 Prevention strategies:  the operator reviews,  prioritizes, implements, and then tracks the process  improvements (prevention strategies) in order to avoid  

or reduce the likelihood of similar errors in the future.  

5.	 Feedback:  the operator provides feedback to the  maintenance workplace so technicians know that  changes have been made to the maintenance system  as a result of this MEDA process.  

The implantation and continuous use of MEDA is a long- term commitment and not a “quick fix.” However, airline  operators and maintenance facilities frequently decide to use  the MEDA approach to investigate serious, high visibility  events which have caused significant cost to the company.  The desire to do this is based upon the potential “payback”  of such an investigation.  

This may ultimately be counterproductive because a highly  visible event may not really be the best opportunity to  investigate errors. Those involved in the process may be  intimidated by the attention coming from upper management  and various regulatory authorities.  

By using the MEDA process properly, the organization can  investigate the factors that contributed to an error, discover  exactly what led to that error, and fix those factors. Successful  implementation of MEDA will allow the organization to  avoid rework, lost revenue, and potentially dangerous  situations related to events caused by maintenance errors.  

The “SHEL” model is another concept for investigating and  evaluating maintenance errors.  [Figure 14-16]  As with other  human factors tools, its goal is to determine not only what the  problem is, but where and why it exists. SHEL was initiated  by Professor Elwyn Edwards (Professor Emeritus, Aston  University, Birmingham, U.K.) in 1972. It was later modified  slightly by the late Capt. Frank Hawkins, a Human Factors  consultant to KLM, in 1975. The acronym SHEL represents:  

•	 S oftware •	 H ardware  

![](images/98f2207e9fb340a42936dcdad6a123ddb71a999023b6c566b651326720948256.jpg)

Figure 14-15.  Resources necessary to complete the job.  

•	 E nvironment •	 L iveware  

The model examines interaction with each of the four SHEL  components, and does not consider interactions not involving  human factors. The term “software” is not referring to the  common use of the term as applied to computer programs.  Instead it includes a broader view of manual layout,  checklist layout, symbology, language (both technical and  nontechnical), and computer programs. Hardware includes  such things as the location of components, the accessibility  of components and tooling. Environment takes temperature,  humidity, sound, light, and time of day factors into account.  Liveware relates technician interaction with other people,  both on the job and off. These include managers, peers,  family, friends, and self.  

No discussion of human factors is complete without reference  to James Reasons’ Model of Accident Causation. This  diagram, which was introduced in 1990, and revised by Dr.  Reason in 1993, is often referred to as the Swiss cheese model  and shows how various “holes” in different systems must be  aligned in order for an error to occur. Only when the holes  are all aligned can the incident take place.  

There are two types of failure which can occur—active  and latent. An active failure is one in which the effects are  immediate. An example of this type would be an aircraft  slipping off one of the lifting jacks due to improper placement  by the technician. In this example, the aircraft jack is the  approved item of ground support equipment, and it has been  properly maintained.  

A latent failure occurs as a result of a decision or action  made long before the incident or accident actually occurs.  The consequences of such a decision may remain dormant  for a long time. An example of a latent failure could also  involve the aircraft slipping off a joint, but in this case, it  could be an unapproved jack being used because funding had  not been approved to purchase the correct ground support  equipment (GSE).  

The field of human factors, especially in aviation maintenance,  is a growing field of study. This section of this chapter has  presented only a small segment of the numerous observations  and presentations about the topic. If the technician desires to  learn more, numerous books exist and a review of Internet  data will provide an abundant supply of information.  

A good place to start researching would be the FAA’s own  website at  hf.faa.gov . This site, titled “Human Factors on  Aviation Maintenance and Inspection (HFAMI)” provides  access to products of the Federal Aviation Administration  Flight Standards Service Human Factors in Aviation  Maintenance and Inspection Program. Many aviation  maintenance industry trade magazines include a section or at  least a page devoted to human factors. “The Human Factors  and Ergonomics Society” is a national organization composed  of 22 technical groups, including one devoted to aerospace  systems, which address both civilian and military issues of  safety and performance.  

# Human Error  

Human error is defined as a human action with unintended  consequences. When you couple error with aviation  maintenance and the negative consequences that it  produces, it becomes extremely troublesome. Training, risk  assessments, safety inspections, etc., should not be restricted  to an attempt to avoid errors but rather to make them visible  and identify them before they produce damaging and  regrettable consequences. Simply put, human error is not  avoidable but it is manageable.  [Figure 14-17]  

# Types of Errors Unintentional  

An unintentional error is an accidental wandering or deviation  from accuracy. This can include an error in your action  (a slip), opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning,  carelessness, or insufficient knowledge (a mistake). For  example, an AMT reads the torque values from a job card  and unintentionally transposed the number 26 to 62. They  did not mean to make that error but unknowingly and  unintentionally did. An example of an unintentional mistake  would be selecting the wrong work card to conduct a specific  repair or task.  Again, it is not an intentional mistake but a  mistake nonetheless.  

# Intentional  

In aviation maintenance, an intentional error should really be  considered a violation. If someone knowingly or intentionally  chooses to do something wrong, it is a violation, which  means that one has purposely deviated from safe practices,  procedures, standards, or regulations.  

# Active & Latent  

An active error is the specific individual activity that is an  obvious event. A latent error is the company issues that lead  up to the event. For example, an AMT climbs up a ladder to  do a repair knowing that the ladder is broken. In this example,  the active error was falling from the ladder. The latent error  was the broken ladder that someone should have replaced.

# The “Dirty Dozen”  

Due to a large number of maintenance-related aviation  accidents and incidents that occurred in the late 1980s and  early 1990s, Transport Canada identified twelve human  factors that degrade people’s ability to perform effectively  and safely, which could lead to maintenance errors. These  twelve factors, known as the “dirty dozen,” were eventually  adopted by the aviation industry as a straightforward means to  discuss human error in maintenance. It is important to know  the dirty dozen, how to recognize their symptoms, and most  importantly, know how to avoid or contain errors produced  by the dirty dozen. Understanding the interaction between  organizational, work group, and individual factors that may  lead to errors and accidents, AMTs can learn to prevent or  manage them proactively in the future.  

# Lack of Communication  

Lack of communication is a key human factor that can  result in suboptimal, incorrect, or faulty maintenance.  [Figure 14-18]  Communication occurs between the AMT  and many people (i.e., management, pilots, parts suppliers,  aircraft servicers). Each exchange holds the potential  for misunderstanding or omission. But communication  between AMTs may be the most important of all. Lack  of communication between technicians could lead to a  maintenance error and result in an aircraft accident. This  is especially true during procedures where more than one  technician performs the work on the aircraft. It is critical  that accurate, complete information be exchanged to ensure  that all work is completed without any step being omitted.  Knowledge and speculation about a task must be clarified and  not confused. Each step of the maintenance procedure must  be performed according to approved instructions as though  only a single technician did the work.  

A common scenario where communication is critical and a  lack thereof can cause problems, is during shift change in an  airline or fixed base operator (FBO) operation. A partially  completed job is transferred from the technician finishing  their workday to the technician coming on duty. Many  steps in a maintenance procedure are not able to be seen or  verified once completed due to the installation of components  hiding the work. No steps in the procedure can be omitted  and some steps still to be performed may be contingent on  the work already completed. The departing technician must  thoroughly explain what has occurred so that the arriving  technician can correctly complete the job. A recounting of  critical steps and any difficulties encountered gives insight.  A lack of communication at this juncture could result in the  work being continued without certain required operations  having been performed.  

The approved steps of a maintenance procedure must be  signed off by the technician doing the work as it is performed.  Continuing a job that has been started by someone else should  only occur after a face-to-face meeting of technicians. The  applicable paperwork should be reviewed, the completed  work discussed, and attention drawing to the next step.  Absence of either a written or oral turnover serves as warning  that an error could occur.  

It is vital that work not be continued on a project without  both oral and written communication between the technician  who started the job and the technician continuing it. Work  should always be done in accordance with the approved  written procedure and all of the performed steps should  bear the signature of the technician who accomplishes the  work. If necessary, a phone call can be made to obtain an  oral turnover when technicians cannot meet face-to-face at  the work area. In general, the technician must see their role  as part of a greater system focused on safe aircraft operation  and must communicate well with all those in that system  to be effective.  

# Complacency  

Complacency is a human factor in aviation maintenance that  typically develops over time.  [Figure 14-18]  As a technician  gains knowledge and experience, a sense of self satisfaction  and false confidence may occur. A repetitive task, especially  an inspection item, may be overlooked or skipped because  the technician has performed the task a number of times  without ever finding a fault. The false assumption might be  made that inspection of the item is not important. However,  even if rare, a fault may exist. The consequences of the fault  not being detected and corrected could cause an incident or  accident. Routine tasks performed over and over allow time  for the technician’s mind to wander, which may also result  in a required task not being performed.  

![](images/ed0e3ac453854ed3893e19e9336c04a9c257aba8531aabf4b2c61aa6fb3f414a.jpg)  
Figure 14-17.  Safety awareness will help foresee and mitigate the  risk of human error.  

When a technician performs work without documentation,  or documents work that was not performed, it is a sign that  complacency may exist. Approved, written maintenance  procedures should be followed during all maintenance  inspections and repairs. Executing the proper paperwork  draws attention to a work item and reinforces its significance.  

To combat complacency, a technician must be trained to  expect to find the fault that created the inspection item in  the first place. The technician must stay mentally engaged  in the task being performed. All inspection items must be  treated with equal importance, and it must never be assumed  that an item is acceptable when it has not been inspected.  A technician should never sign for any work that has not  been performed. Prior to the pen touching the paper for a  signature, the technician should read the item before signing  and confirm it has been performed.  

# Lack of Knowledge  

A lack of knowledge when performing aircraft maintenance  can result in a faulty repair that can have catastrophic results.  [Figure 14-20]  Differences in technology from aircraft to  aircraft and updates to technology and procedures on a single  aircraft also make it challenging to obtain the knowledge  required to perform airworthy maintenance.  

All maintenance must be performed to standards specified  in approved instructions. These instructions are based on  knowledge gained from the engineering and operation of  the aircraft equipment. Technicians must be sure to use the  latest applicable data and follow each step of the procedure  as outlined. They must also be aware that differences exist in  the design and maintenance procedures on different aircraft.  It is important for technicians to obtain training on different  types of aircraft. When in doubt, a technician with experience  on the aircraft should be consulted. If one is not available, or  the consulted technician is not familiar with the procedure, a  manufacturer’s technical representative should be contacted.  It is better to delay a maintenance procedure than to do it  incorrectly and cause an accident.  

# Distraction  

A distraction while performing maintenance on an aircraft  may disrupt the procedure.  [Figure 14-21]  When work  resumes, it is possible that the technician skips over a  detail that needs attention. It is estimated that 15 percent of  maintenance related errors are caused by distractions.  

Distractions can be mental or physical in nature. They can  occur when the work is located on the aircraft or in the  hangar. They can also occur in the psyche of the technician  independent of the work environment. Something as simple  as a cell phone call or a new aircraft being pushed into the  

![](images/893193c8dc7cea16a243a1cdf740ce4690e6ba737b77e48aaf87d8307d42fa73.jpg)  

hangar can disrupt the technician’s concentration on a job.  Less visible is a difficult family or financial matter or other  personal issues that may occupy the technician’s thought  process as work is performed. This can make performance  of the required maintenance less effective.  

Whatever their nature, numerous distractions can occur during  the course of maintaining an aircraft. The technician must  recognize when attention to the job at hand is being diverted  and assure that work continues correctly. A good practice  is to go back three steps in the work procedure from when  distraction occurred and resume the job from that point. Using  of a detailed step-by-step written procedure and signing off  each step only after it is completed also helps. Incomplete  work can be marked or tagged, especially when the technician  is pulled from the work by a distraction, and it is unknown  when work will be resumed and by whom. Disconnect any  connector and leave it plainly visible if an installation is not  complete. There is a tendency to think a job is finished when  a component is “hooked up.” Similarly, when a step in the  maintenance procedure is complete, be sure to immediately  lock wire or torque the fasteners if required. This can be used  as an indication that all is well up to that point in the procedure.  

# Lack of Teamwork  

A lack of teamwork may also contribute to errors in aircraft  maintenance.  [Figure 14-22]  Closely related to the need for  communication, teamwork is required in aviation maintenance  in many instances. Sharing of knowledge between technicians,  coordinating maintenance functions, turning work over from  shift to shift, and working with flight personnel to troubleshoot  and test aircraft are all are executed better in an atmosphere  of teamwork. Often associated with improved safety in the  workplace, teamwork involves everyone understanding  and agreeing on actions to be taken. A gear swing or other  operational check involves all the members of a team working  together. Multiple technicians contribute to the effort to ensure  a single outcome. They communicate and look out for one  another as they do the job. A consensus is formed that the  item is airworthy or not airworthy.  

The technician primarily deals with the physical aspect of  the aircraft and its airworthiness. Others in the organization  perform their roles and the entire company functions as a  team. Teams can win or lose depending on how well everyone  in the organization works together toward a common  objective. A lack of teamwork makes all jobs more difficult  and, in maintenance, could result in a mis communication  that affects the airworthiness of the aircraft.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is a major human factor that has contributed  to many maintenance errors resulting in accidents.  

[Figure 14-23]  Fatigue can be mental or physical in  nature. Emotional fatigue also exists and affects mental  and physical performance. A person is said to be fatigued  when a reduction or impairment in any of the following  occurs: cognitive ability, decision-making, reaction time,  coordination, speed, strength, or balance. Fatigue reduces  alertness and often reduces a person’s ability to focus on the  task being performed.  

Symptoms of fatigue can also include short-term memory  problems, channeled concentration on unimportant issues  while neglecting more important ones, and failure to maintain  a situational overview. A fatigued person may be easily  distracted or may be nearly impossible to distract. They  may experience abnormal mood swings. Fatigue results in  an increase in mistakes, poor judgment, and poor decisions  or perhaps no decisions at all. A fatigued person may also  lower their standards.  

Tiredness is a symptom of fatigue. However, sometimes a  fatigued person may feel wide awake and engaged in a task.  The primary cause of fatigue is a lack of sleep. Good restful  sleep, free from drugs or alcohol is a human necessity to  prevent fatigue. Fatigue can also be caused by stress and  overworking. A person’s mental and physical state also  naturally cycles through various levels of performance each  day. Variables such as body temperature, blood pressure,  heart rate, blood chemistry, alertness, and attention rise and  fall in a pattern daily. This is known as circadian rhythm.  [Figure 14-24]  A person’s ability to work (and rest) rises and  falls during this cycle, and performance counter to circadian  rhythm can be difficult. Until it becomes extreme, a person  may be unaware that they are fatigued. It is easier recognized  by another person or in the results of tasks being performed.  This is particularly dangerous in aviation maintenance since  the lives of people depend on maintenance procedures  performed at a high level of proficiency. Working alone when  fatigued is particularly dangerous.  

The best remedy for fatigue is to get enough sleep on a  regular basis. The technician must be aware of the amount  and quality of sleep obtained. Time off is justified when  too little sleep has occurred and errors are probable during  maintenance. Countermeasures to fatigue are often used, but  their effectiveness can be short lived and many can make  fatigue worse. Caffeine is a common fatigue countermeasure.  Pseudoephedrine found in sinus medicine and amphetamines  are also used. While they can be effective for short periods, the  underlying fatigue remains and due to this drug use, the person  may have trouble getting the rest needed once off the job.  

Suggestions to help mitigate the problems caused by fatigue  include looking for symptoms of fatigue in oneself and in

others. Have others check your work, even if an inspector sign  off is not required. Avoid complex tasks during the bottom  of your circadian rhythm. Sleep and exercise daily. Eight to  nine hours of daily sleep are recommended to avoid fatigue.  AMTs in airline operations are part of a system in which  most maintenance is performed at night. Fleet aircraft are  operated primarily during daytime hours to generate company  revenue. Therefore, shift work is required to maintain the  fleet. It is already known that turning work over to other  technicians during shift changes can lead to errors due to  lack of communication. But shift work alone is a cause of  fatigue that can degrade performance and also lead to errors.  Shift work requires technicians to work during low cycles  of their natural circadian rhythm. It also makes sleep more  difficult when not on the job. Furthermore, regular night shift  work makes a person’s body more sensitive to environmental  disturbances. It can degrade performance, morale, and  safety. It can also affect one’s physical health. All of these  can be reflected in degraded maintenance performance—a  dangerous situation.  

The technician must be aware that shift work is the norm in  

![](images/906005632b1f9e3a9a67f52b6ffcc37c0278b6c49e6a672155c2d71f126a6df6.jpg)  
Figure 14-20.  Lack of knowledge.  

aviation. Avoidance of fatigue is part of the job. Title 14 of  the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 121, section  377, only requires 24 hours time off during a week of work.  Since this is obviously not enough, it is up to companies and  technicians to regulate shift work and time off to reduce the  potential for errors. Most importantly, each technician must  monitor and control their sleep habits to avoid fatigue.  

# Lack of Resources  

A lack of resources can interfere with a person’s ability to  complete a task because of a lack of supplies and support.  [Figure 14-25]  Low quality products also affect one’s ability  to complete a task. Aviation maintenance demands proper  tools and parts to maintain a fleet of aircraft. Any lack of  resources to safely carry out a maintenance task can cause  both non-fatal and fatal accidents. For example, if an aircraft  is dispatched without a functioning system that is typically  nonessential for flight but suddenly becomes needed, this  

# THE DIRTY DOZEN  

![](images/7dfe0886c6ee16a20034782f6b43e926cbaf486b5955de933158e0898a87ef3b.jpg)  

could create a problem.  

Parts are not the only resources needed to do a job properly,  but all too frequently parts become a critical issue. AMTs can  try to be proactive by checking suspected areas or tasks that  may require parts at the beginning of the inspection. Aircraft  on ground (AOG) is a term in aviation maintenance indicating  that a problem is serious enough to prevent an aircraft from  flying. In these cases, there is a rush to acquire the parts to  put the aircraft back into service and prevent further delays  or cancellations of the planned itinerary. AOG applies to any  aviation materials or spare parts that are needed immediately  for an aircraft to return to service. AOG suppliers refer  qualified personnel and dispatch the parts required to repair  the aircraft for an immediate return to service. AOG also is  used to describe critical shipments for parts or materials for  aircraft “out of service” (OTS) at a location.  

If the status of an aircraft is AOG and materials required are  not on hand, parts and personnel must be driven, flown, or

Figure 14-22.  Lack of teamwork.  

sailed to the location of the grounded aircraft. Usually the  problem is escalated through an internal AOG desk, then  the manufacturer’s AOG desk, and finally competitors’  AOG desks. All major air carriers have an AOG desk that is  manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by personnel trained  in purchasing, hazardous materials shipping, and parts  manufacturing and acquisition processes.  

Within an organization, making sure that personnel have the  correct tools for the job is just as important as having the  proper parts when they are needed. Having the correct tools  means not having to improvise. For example, an aircraft that  had received a new interior needed to be weighed prior to  being released to fly. Two days before the planned release, the  aircraft was weighed without the proper electronic load cells  placed between the aircraft jack and the aircraft. Because the  correct equipment was not used, the aircraft slipped off of  one of the load cells and the jack point creased the spar. The  cost of improvising can be very steep. The right tools for the  job need to be used at all times, and if they are broken, out of

# Figure 14-23.  Fatigue.  

calibration, or missing, they need to be repaired, calibrated,  or found as soon as possible.  

Technical documentation is another critical resource that can  lead to problems in aviation maintenance. When trying to  find out more about the task at hand or how to troubleshoot  and repair a system, the needed information often cannot be  found because the manuals or diagrams are not available.  If the information is unavailable, personnel should ask  a supervisor or speak with a technical representative  or technical publications department at the appropriate  aircraft manufacturer. Most manuals are in a constant state  of revision and, if organizations do not identify missing  information in the manuals, then nothing is done to correct the  documentation. Resources such as publications departments  and manufacturers’ technical support are available and should  be used rather than ignoring the problem.  

Another valuable resource that the maintenance department  should rely on is the flight crew. Organizations should  

![](images/e77ef14a065647ff1a71f72bd5a1729d9defc4635c24a0d7bdf94607fd846eb2.jpg)  
Figure 14-24.  Many human variables rise and fall daily due to one’s natural circadian rhythm.  

encourage open communication between flight crews and  maintenance crews. The flight crew can provide valuable  information when dealing with a defective part or problem.  Figure 14-26  shows a number of questions that flight crews can  be asked to help resolve and understand maintenance issues.  

When the proper resources are available for the task at hand,  there is a much higher probability that maintenance will do  a better, more efficient job and higher likelihood that the job  will be done correctly the first time. Organizations must learn  to use all of the resources that are available and, if the correct  resources are not available, make the necessary arrangements  to get them in a timely manner. The end result saves time  and money, and enables organizations to complete the task  knowing the aircraft is airworthy.  

# Pressure  

Aviation maintenance tasks require individuals to perform  in an environment with constant pressure to do things  better and faster without making mistakes and letting things  fall through the cracks. Unfortunately, these types of job  pressures can affect the capabilities of maintenance workers  to get the job done right.  [Figure 14-27]  Airlines have  strict financial guidelines, as well as tight flight schedules,  that pressure mechanics to identify and repair mechanical  problems quickly so that the airline industry can keep  moving. Most important, aircraft mechanics are responsible  for the overall safety of everyone who uses flying as a mode  of transportation.  

Organizations must be aware of the time pressures that are put  on aircraft mechanics and help them manage all of the tasks  that need to be completed so that all repairs, while done in a  timely manner, are completed correctly with safety being the  ultimate goal. Sacrificing quality and safety for the sake of time  should not be tolerated or accepted. Likewise, AMTs need to  recognize on their own when time pressures are clouding their  judgments and causing them to make unnecessary mistakes.  Self-induced pressures are those occasions where one takes  ownership of a situation that was not of their doing.  

In an effort to combat self-induced pressure, technicians  should ask for help if they feel overwhelmed and under a  time constraint to complete a repair. Another method is to  have someone check the repair thoroughly to ensure that all  maintenance tasks were completed correctly.  

Lastly, if given a repair with a specific time limitation that  you feel is unrealistic or compromises safety, bring it to  the attention of the organization’s management and openly  discuss a different course of action.  

# Lack of Assertiveness  

Assertiveness is the ability to express your feelings, opinions,  beliefs, and needs in a positive, productive manner and should  not be confused with being aggressive.  [Figure 14-28]  It  is important for AMTs to be assertive in issues relating to  aviation repair rather than choosing not to or not being  allowed to voice their concerns and opinions. Not being  assertive could ultimately cost people their lives. The  following are examples of how a lack of assertiveness can  be offset:  

1.	 Address managers and supervisors directly by stating  the problem. 	 Example: “John, I have a concern with how this repair  

# THE DIRTY DOZEN  

![](images/474647e4290df84c9f79be997fa0ffb1c4490868328a9cc555d52ef6973a7743.jpg)  
Figure 14-25.  Lack of resources.  

is being rushed.”  

2.	 Explain what the consequences will be.

 	 Example: “If we continue, the result will be that the  part will break sooner rather than later.”

 3.	 Propose possible solutions to the problem.

 	 Example: “We could try doing things another way or  you may want to try this way.”

 4.	 Always solicit feedback and include other opinions. Example: “John, what do you think?”  

When being assertive with co-workers or management,  deal with one issue at a time rather than trying to tackle a  number of problems at once. It is also important to have  documentation and facts to back up your argument, which can  give people a visual account of what you are trying to explain.  A lack of assertiveness in failing to speak up when things  do not seem right has resulted in many fatal accidents. This  can easily be changed by promoting good communication  between co-workers and having an open relationship with  supervisors and management. Maintenance managers must be  familiar with the behavior styles of the people they supervise  and learn to utilize their talents, experience, and wisdom.  As the employees become aware of behavior styles and  understand their own behavior, they see how they unwittingly  contribute to some of their own problems and how they can  make adjustments. Assertive behavior may not be a skill that  comes naturally to every individual, but it is a critical skill  to achieve effectiveness. AMTs should give supervisors and  management the kind of feedback required to ensure that they  will be able to assist mechanics in doing their job.  

# Stress  

Aviation maintenance is a stressful task due to many factors.  [Figure 14-29]  Aircraft must be functional and flying in order  for airlines to make money, which means that maintenance  must be done within a short timeframe to avoid flight delays  and cancellations. Fast-paced technology that is always  changing can add stress to technicians. This demands that  AMTs stay trained on the latest equipment. Other stressors  include working in dark, tight spaces, lack of resources to  get the repair done correctly, and long hours. The ultimate  stress of aviation maintenance is knowing that the work they  do, if not done correctly, could result in tragedy.  

Everyone handles stress differently and particular situations  can bring about different degrees of difficulty for different  people. For example, working under a strict timeline can be  a stressor for one person and normal for another. The causes  of stress are referred to as “stressors” and are categorized as  physical, psychological, or physiological. Following is a list  of each and how they may affect maintenance.  

# Physical Stressors  

Physical stressors add to a person’s workload and make their  work environment uncomfortable.  

•	 Temperature—high temperatures in the hangar  increase perspiration and heart rate causing the body  to overheat. Low temperatures can cause the body to  feel cold, weak, and drowsy. •	 Noise—hangars that have high noise levels (due to  aircraft taking off and landing close by) can make  it difficult for maintenance personnel to focus  and concentrate. •	 Lighting—poor lighting within a work space makes  it difficult to read technical data and manuals.  Likewise, working inside an aircraft with poor lighting  increases the propensity to miss something or to repair  something incorrectly. •	 Confined spaces—small work spaces make it very

Figure 14-26.  Questions that technicians can ask flight crews in an  effort to resolve and understand maintenance issues.  

difficult to perform tasks, as technicians are often  contorted into unusual positions for a long period  of time.  

# Psychological Stressors  

Psychological stressors relate to emotional factors, such  as a death or illness in the family; business worries; poor  interpersonal relationships with family, co-workers, or  supervisors; and financial worries.  

•	 Work-related stressors—over anxiousness can hinder  performance and speed while conducting maintenance  if there is any apprehension about how to do a repair  or concerns about getting it done on time.  •	 Financial problems—impending bankruptcy,  recession, loans, and mortgages are a few examples  of financial problems that can create stressors. •	 Marital problems—divorce and strained relationships  can interfere with one’s ability to perform their job  correctly.  •	 Interpersonal problems—problems with superiors  and colleagues due to mis communication or  perceived competition and backstabbing can cause  a hostile work environment.

Figure 14-27.  Pressure.  

# Physiological Stressors  

Physiological stressors include fatigue, poor physical  condition, hunger, and disease.  

•	 Poor physical condition—trying to work when ill  or not feeling well can force the body to use more  energy fighting the illness, leaving less energy to  perform vital tasks.  •	 Proper meals—not eating enough, or eating foods  

lacking the proper nutrition, can result in low energy  and induce symptoms like headaches and shaking.

 •	 Lack of sleep—a fatigued AMT is unable to perform  to standard for long periods of time and can become  sloppy with repairs and make significant mistakes.

 •	 Conflicting shift schedules—the effect of changing  sleep patterns on the body’s circadian cycle can lead  to a degradation of performance.  

![](images/4f2246c8c08676db909717a4f2d9b8f86014b801f0f93c314292b25bd444fac6.jpg)  
Figure 14-28.  Lack of assertiveness.  

People cope with stress in many different ways. Specialists  say that the first step is to identify stressors and the  symptoms that occur after exposure to those stressors. Other  recommendations involve development or maintenance of a  healthy lifestyle with adequate rest and exercise, a healthy  diet, limited consumption of alcoholic drinks, and avoidance  of tobacco products.  

# Lack of Awareness  

Lack of awareness is defined as a failure to recognize all the  consequences of an action or lack of foresight.  [Figure 14-30] In aviation maintenance, it is not unusual to perform the same  maintenance tasks repeatedly. After completing the same  task multiple times, it is easy for technicians to become less  vigilant and develop a lack of awareness of what they are  doing and what is around them. Each time a task is completed  it must be treated as if it were the first time.  

# Norms  

Norms is short for “normal,” or the way things are normally  done.  [Figure 14-31]  They are unwritten rules that are  followed or tolerated by most organizations. Negative  norms can detract from the established safety standard and  cause an accident to occur. Norms are usually developed  to solve problems that have ambiguous solutions. When  faced with an ambiguous situation, an individual may use  another’s behavior as a frame of reference around which to  form their own reactions. As this process continues, group  norms develop and stabilize. Newcomers to the situation are  then accepted into the group based on adherence to norms.  Very rarely do newcomers initiate change in a group with  established norms.  

Some norms are unsafe in that they are non-productive or  detract from the productivity of the group. Taking shortcuts in  aircraft maintenance, working from memory, or not following  procedures are examples of unsafe norms. Newcomers are  better able to identify these unsafe norms than long-standing  members of the group. On the other hand, the newcomer’s  credibility depends on their assimilation into the group. The  newcomer’s assimilation, however, depends on adherence  to the group norms. Everyone should be aware of the  perceptiveness of newcomers in identifying unhealthy norms  and develop a positive attitude toward the possibility that  norms may need to be changed. Finally, as newcomers become  assimilated into the group structure, they build credibility with  others. Once this has been done, a relative newcomer may  begin to institute change within the group. Unfortunately,  such actions are often difficult to do and rely heavily on the  group’s perception of the newcomer’s credibility.  

Norms have been identified as one of the dirty dozen in  aviation maintenance and a great deal of anecdotal evidence  points to the use of unsafe norms on the line. The effect of  unsafe norms may range from the relatively benign, such as  determining accepted meeting times, to the inherently unsafe,  such as signing off on incomplete maintenance tasks. Any  behavior commonly accepted by the group, whether as a  standard operating procedure (SOP) or not, can be a norm.  Supervisors need to ensure that everyone adheres to the same  standards and that unsafe norms are not tolerated. AMTs  should pride themselves on following procedure, rather than  unsafe norms that may have been adopted as regular practice.

Figure 14-30.  Lack of awareness.  

# Example of Common Maintenance Errors  

In an effort to identify the most frequently occurring  maintenance discrepancies, the United Kingdom Civil  Aviation Authority (CAA) conducted in-depth studies of  maintenance sites on aviation maintenance operations. The  following list is what they found to be the most common  occurring maintenance errors.  

1.	 Incorrect installation of components.  2.	 Fitting of wrong parts.  3.	 Electrical wiring discrepancies to include crossing  connections.  [Figure 14-32]  

4.	 Forgotten tools and parts.  5.	 Failure to lubricate.  [Figure 14-33] 6.	 Failure to secure access panels, fairings, or cowlings.  7.	 Fuel or oil caps and fuel panels not secured.  8.	 Failure to remove lock pins.  [Figure 14-34]  

All of the maintenance discrepancies listed above can be  avoided if the proper procedures are followed on the job  card that is being used.  [Figure 14-35]  Regardless of how  many times the task has been completed, each time you

Figure 14-31.  Norms.  

pick up a job card, treat it like it is the first time you have  ever completed the task, and complete it with diligence and  complete accuracy.  

Historically, twenty percent of all accidents are caused by  a machine failure, and eighty percent by human factors.  [Figure 14-36]  Originally focusing on the pilot community,  human factors awareness has now spread into the training  sphere of maintenance technicians.  An in-depth review of  an aviation incident reveals time and again that a series of  human errors (known also as a chain of events) was allowed  to build until the accident occurred.  If the chain of events is  broken at the maintenance level, the likelihood of the accident  occurring can be drastically decreased.  Figure 14-37  is a list  of maintenance-related incidents/accidents and their causes.  It is easy to see how many of the “Dirty Dozen” contributed  to the causes or were considered contributing factors.  

# Where to Get Information  

Following is a list of websites and references that are good  sources of information on human factors.  

# Incident  

On March 20, 2001, a Lufthansa Airbus A320 almost  crashed shortly after takeoff because of reversed wiring in  the captain's sidestick flight control. Quick action by the  co-pilot, whose sidestick was not faulty, prevented a crash.  

# Cause  

The investigation has focused on maintenance on the  captain's controls carried out by Lufthansa Technik just  before the flight. During the previous flight, a problem with  one of the two elevator/aileron computers (ELAC) had  occurred. An electrical pin in the connector was found to  be damaged and was replaced. It has been confirmed that  two pairs of pins inside the connector had accidentally  been crossed during the repair. This changed the polarity  in the sidestick and the respective control channels  “bypassing” the control unit, which might have sensed the  error and would have triggered a warning. Clues might  have been seen on the electronic centralized aircraft  monitor (ECAM) screen during the flight control checks,  but often pilots only check for a deflection indication, not  the direction. Before the aircraft left the hangar, a flight  control check was performed by the mechanic, but only  using the first officer’s sidestick.

# Accident  

Alaska Airlines Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83  aircraft, experienced a fatal accident on January 31, 2000,  in the Pacific Ocean. The two pilots, three cabin  crewmembers, and 83 passengers on board were killed and  the aircraft was destroyed.  

# Cause  

The subsequent investigation by the National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that  inadequate maintenance led to excessive wear and  catastrophic failure of a critical flight control system during  flight. The probable cause was stated to be “a loss of  airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of  the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly’s  acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by  excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines’ insufficient  lubrication of the jackscrew assembly.”

# INCIDENT  

August 26, 1993, an Excalibur Airways Airbus 320 took off from London-Gatwick Airport  (LGW) and exhibited an undemanded roll  to the right on takeoff, a condition which persisted until the aircraft landed back at LGW 37 minutes later. Control of the aircraft  required significant left sidestick at all times and the flight control system was degraded by the loss of spoiler control.  

# CAUSE  

Technicians familiar with Boeing 757 flap change procedures lacked the knowledge required to correctly lock out the spoilers on the  Airbus during the flap change work that was done the day before the flight. Turnover to technicians on the next shift compounded  the problem. No mention of incorrect spoiler lockout procedure was given since it was assumed that the 320 was like the 757. The  flap change was operationally checked, but the spoiler remained locked out incorrectly and was not detected by the flight crew  during standard functional checks. The lack of knowledge on Airbus procedures was considered a primary cause of this incident.  

# INCIDENT  

April 26, 2001, an Emery Worldwide Airlines DC-8-71F left main landing gear would not extend for landing.  

# CAUSE

# ACCIDENT  

On August 26, 2003, a Colgan Air Beech 1900D crashed just after takeoff from Hyannis, Massachusetts. Both pilots were killed.  

# CAUSE  

The improper replacement of the forward elevator trim cable and subsequent inadequate functional check of the maintenance  performed resulted in a reversal of the elevator trim system and a loss of control in flight. Factors were the flight crew’s failure to  follow the checklist procedures and the aircraft manufacturer’s erroneous depiction of the elevator trim drum in the maintenance  manual.  

# ACCIDENT  

On September 28, 2007, American Airlines Flight 1400 DC-9 experienced an in-flight engine fire during departure climb from  Lambert St. Louis International Airport (STL).  During the return to STL, the nose landing gear failed to extend, and the flight crew  executed a go-around, during which the crew extended the nose gear using the emergency procedure. The flight crew conducted  an emergency landing, and the 2 flight crewmembers, 3 flight attendants, and 138 passengers deplaned on the runway. No  occupant injuries were reported, but the airplane sustained substantial damage from the fire.  

# CAUSE  

American Airlines’ maintenance personnel’s use of an inappropriate manual engine-start procedure, which led to the uncom- manded opening of the left engine air turbine starter valve, and a subsequent left engine fire.
