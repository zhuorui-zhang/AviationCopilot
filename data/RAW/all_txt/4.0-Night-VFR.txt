guide suggests ways to teach risk man age ment for safe VFR flying at night  

# PROFILE  

Factors in night accidents often include errors in planning, decision-making, and risk management. Fatigue can contrib- ute tosuch errors.Its effectsinclude:  

."Channelized" attention ·Poor judgment ·Slowed reaction time ·lnattention ·Ease of distraction  

Other errors common in night VFR acci dentsinclude:  

·Lack of proper equipment (flash- lights, batteries) ·Loss of situational awareness ·Problems with night vision ·lnadequate traffic scan ·Vulnerability to optical illusions  

# PRACTICES  

Consider structuring a night training or proficiency session as a short cross- country flight, with night takeoff and landing practice at the destination air- port. During each phase of the flight, look for (or create) "teachable moment" scenarios that provide an opportunity to teach good risk management pra c- ticesfor night VFRflying.  

Sample Scenarios  

1.Preflight:Ask the pilot tolist hazards related to pilot (fatigue, night experi- ence), aircraft (working lights), environ- ment (airport lighting, terrain), and ex- ternal pressures (closing times).Stress the importance of a thorough pre flight that includes checking all essential lights and reviewing the location of key circuitbreakers.  

2. Taxi/Takeoff: Simulate an electrical failure during taxi to teach the impor- tance of planning the taxi route, know- ing the airport layout, and positioning a flashlight to illuminate the panel in case of electrical failure after takeoff.Use the Airport/Facility Directory to obtainthe correct frequencies for activating lights.  

3. Enroute: Consider diverting the flight due to simulated bad weather.Ask the pilot to select an alternate and explain why it is a safe choice.Encourage use of the Air Safety Foundation's Terrain Avoidance Planning tools,or carry IFR enroutecharts tohelpstayabove ter- rain. A VFR flight plan and VFR flight fol- lowing are excellent practices for night VFR.If the flight takes place above 5,ooo MSL,remind the pilot that oxygencan help night vision.  

Descent/Approach: :Be surethat thepilotunderstandsthedestination airport's runway layout and lighting. Where is the rotating beacon in relation to the runway or to terrain?  

5. Landing/Parking: A new place can be confusing in darkness,soteachthe pilot to keep a taxi diagram close by. During ground operations near other aircraft, donotusestrobesoraimlandinglights at other pilots.  

Throughout the flight, ask the pilot to consider consequences of each deci- sion, list alternative actions, recognize thereality ofthe situation,andbe sen- sitive to any external pressures that can distract or drive an unsafe decision.  

# POSTFLIGHT  

Use the postflight discussiontoask questions that let the pilot learn from his or her decisions.Forinstance:  

·What part(s) of the flight made you uncomfortable?  

lf you could change something you did,what would it be, and why?
