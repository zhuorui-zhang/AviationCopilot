# Aircraft  Weight and Balance  Handbook  

2016  

# Preface  

The Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook has been prepared in recognition of the importance of weight and balance  technology in conducting safe and efficient flight. The objective of this handbook is twofold: to provide the airframe and  powerplant mechanic (A&P) with the method of determining the empty weight and empty weight center of gravity (EWCG)  of an aircraft and to furnish the flight crew with information on loading and operating the aircraft to ensure its weight is  within the allowable limit and the center of gravity (CG) is within the allowable range.  

Any time there is a conflict between the information in this handbook and specific information issued by an aircraft  manufacturer, the manufacturer’s data takes precedence over information in this handbook. Occasionally, the word “must”  or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to,  interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR. The current  Flight Standards Service airman training and testing material and learning statements for all airman certificates and ratings  can be obtained from www.faa.gov.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-1A, Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook, dated 2007.

# Introduction  

This handbook begins with the basic principle of aircraft weight and balance control, emphasizing its importance and  including examples of documentation furnished by the aircraft manufacturer and by the FAA to ensure the aircraft weight  and balance records contain the proper data.  

Procedures for the preparation and the actual weighing of an aircraft are described, as are the methods of determining the  location of the empty weight center of gravity (EWCG) relative to both the datum and the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC).  

Loading computations for general aviation aircraft are discussed using both loading graphs and tables of weight and  moment indexes.  

Information is included that allows an FAA-certifi ated mechanic or repairman to determine the weight and center of gravity  (CG) changes caused by repairs and alterations or removal and installation of equipment. This includes instructions for  conducting adverse-loaded CG checks, also explaining the way to determine the amount and location of ballast needed to  bring the CG within allowable limits.  

The unique requirements for helicopter weight and balance control are discussed, including the determination of lateral CG  and the way both lateral and longitudinal CG change as fuel is consumed.  

One chapter includes the methods and examples of solving weight and balance problems using a hand-held electronic  calculator, E6-B flight computer, and a dedicated electronic flight compute

# Introduction  

There are many factors in the safe and efficient operation of  aircraft, including proper weight and balance control. The  weight and balance system commonly employed among  aircraft consists of three equally important elements: the  weighing of the aircraft, the maintaining of the weight and  balance records, and the proper loading of the aircraft. An  inaccuracy in any one of these elements defeats the purpose  of the system. The finalloading calculations are meaningless  if either the aircraft has been improperly weighed or the  records contain an error.  

![](images/afa5971fa5804bf8d4ddaf04852f4fd7d5594d9b48cb41a5d7b04c8fec2aaa6b.jpg)  

Improper loading decreases the effic ency and performance of  an aircraft from the standpoint of altitude, maneuverability,  rate of climb, and speed. It may even be the cause of failure  to complete the flight or, for that matter, failure to start the  flight.Because of abnormal stresses placed upon the structure  of an improperly loaded aircraft, or because of changed fly ng  characteristics of the aircraft, loss of life and destruction of  valuable equipment may result.  

Aircraft can perform safely and achieve their designed  efficiency only when they are operated and maintained in the  way their designers intended. This safety and  effi ciency is  determined to a large degree by holding the aircraft’s weight  and balance parameters within the limits specifiedfor its design.  The remainder of this handbook describes how this is done.  

# Responsibility for Weight and Balance  Control  

The responsibility for proper weight and balance control  begins with the engineers and designers and extends to the  technicians who maintain the aircraft and the pilots who  operate them. Modern aircraft are engineered utilizing state- of-the-art technology and materials to achieve maximum  reliability and performance for the intended category. As  much care and expertise must be exercised in operating  and maintaining these efficient aircraft as was taken in their  design and manufacturing:  

1.	 The designers of an aircraft set the maximum weight  based on the amount of lift the wings or rotors can  provide under the operational conditions for which  the aircraft is designed. The structural strength of the  aircraft also limits the maximum weight the aircraft  can safely carry. The designers carefully determine  the ideal center of gravity (CG) and calculate the  maximum allowable deviation from this specific  location.  

2.	 The manufacturer provides the aircraft operator with  the empty weight of the aircraft and the location of its  empty weight center of gravity (EWCG) at the time  the certified aircraft leaves the factory. Amateur-built  aircraft must have this information determined and  available at the time of certification  

3.	 The FAA-certificated mechanic or repairman who  maintains the aircraft keeps the weight and balance  records current, recording any changes that have been  made because of repairs or alterations.  

4.	 The pilot in command (PIC) has the responsibility  prior to every flight to know the maximum allowable  weight of the aircraft and its CG limits. This allows  the pilot to determine during the preflight inspection  that the aircraft is loaded so that the CG is within the  allowable limits.  

# Terminology  

Pilots and FAA-certificated mechanics or repairmen must  ensure they understand the terms as they relate to the  aircraft in question. For small aircraft terminology, use  the information found in sources associated with Civil  Air Regulation (CAR) 3 certification or General Aviation  Manufacturers Association (GAMA) Specification No. 1  for part 23 aircraft or part 27 for rotorcraft. For terminology  applied to large part 25 aircraft, information can be found  in Advisory Circular (AC) 120-27, Aircraft Weight and  Balance Control. The glossary contains the most current  terms and defin tions. Current regulations are available from  the Superintendent of Documents; U.S. Government Printing  Office;Washington, DC 20402. They are also located on the  FAA website at www.faa.gov. Earlier regulations may be  available in libraries or in the Federal Register.  

# Weight Control  

Weight is a major factor in airplane construction and  operation, and it demands respect from all pilots and  particular diligence by all maintenance personnel. Excessive  weight reduces the efficiencyof an aircraft and the available  safety margin if an emergency condition should arise.  

When an aircraft is designed, it is made as light as the  required structural strength allows, and the wings or rotors are  designed to support the maximum allowable weight. When  the weight of an aircraft is increased, the wings or rotors must  produce additional lift and the structure must support not  only the additional static loads, but also the dynamic loads  imposed by flight maneuvers. For example, the wings of a  3,000-pound airplane must support 3,000 pounds in level  flight, but when the airplane is turned smoothly and sharply  using a bank angle of   $60^{\circ}$  , the dynamic load requires the  wings to support twice this or 6,000 pounds.  

Severe uncoordinated maneuvers or flight into turbulence  can impose dynamic loads on the structure great enough  to cause failure. In accordance with Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 23, the structure of a  normal category airplane must be strong enough to sustain  a load factor of 3.8 times its weight. Every pound of weight  added to a normal category aircraft requires that the structure  be strong enough to support 3.8 pounds. An aircraft operated  in the utility category must sustain a load factor of 4.4 times  its weight, and acrobatic category aircraft must be strong  enough to withstand 6.0 times their weight.  

The lift produced by a wing is determined by its airfoil shape,  angle of attack, speed through the air, and air density. When  an aircraft takes off from an airport with a high density  altitude, it must accelerate to a speed faster than would be  required at sea level to produce enough lift to allow takeoff;  therefore, a longer takeoff run is necessary. The distance  needed may be longer than the available runway. When  operating from a high density altitude airport, the Pilot’s  Operating Handbook (POH) or Airplane Flight Manual  (AFM) must be consulted to determine the maximum weight  allowed for the aircraft under the conditions of altitude,  temperature, wind, and runway conditions.  

# Effects of Weight  

Most modern aircraft are so designed that, when all seats  are occupied, the baggage compartment is full, and all fuel  tanks are full, the aircraft is grossly overloaded. This type  of design requires the pilot to give great consideration to  the requirements of each specific flight. If maximum range  is required, occupants or baggage must be left behind, or if  the maximum load must be carried, the range, dictated by  the amount of fuel on board, must be reduced.  

Overloading an aircraft can create a variety of problems:  

•	 The aircraft needs a higher takeoff speed, which results  in a longer takeoff run. •	 Both the rate and angle of climb are reduced. •	 The service ceiling is lowered. •	 The cruising speed is reduced. •	 The cruising range is shortened. •	 Maneuverability is decreased. •	 A longer landing roll is required because the landing  speed is higher. •	 Excessive loads are imposed on the structure,  especially the landing gear.  

The POH or AFM includes tables or charts that give the pilot  an indication of the performance expected for any weight.  An important part of careful preflight planning includes a  check of these charts to determine if the aircraft is loaded so  the proposed flight can be safely made  

# Weight Changes  

The maximum allowable weight for an aircraft is determined  by design considerations. However, the maximum operational  weight may be less than the maximum allowable weight due  to such considerations as high density altitude or high-drag  fieldconditions caused by wet grass or water on the runway.  The maximum operational weight may also be limited by the  departure or arrival airport’s runway length.  

One important preflight consideration is the distribution  of the load in the aircraft. Loading the aircraft so the gross  weight is less than the maximum allowable is not enough.  This weight must be distributed to keep the CG within the  limits specified in the POH or AFM  

If the CG is too far forward, a heavy passenger can be moved  to one of the rear seats or baggage may be shifted from a  forward baggage compartment to a rear compartment. If the  CG is too far aft, passenger weight or baggage can be shifted  forward. The fuel load should be balanced laterally. The pilot  should pay special attention to the POH or AFM regarding  the operation of the fuel system in order to keep the aircraft  balanced in flight  

Weight and balance of a helicopter is far more critical  than for an airplane. Some helicopters may be properly  loaded for takeoff, but near the end of a long flight when  the fuel tanks are almost empty, the CG may have shifted  enough for the helicopter to be out of balance laterally or  longitudinally. Before making any long flight, the CG with  the fuel available for landing must be checked to ensure it is  within the allowable range.  

Airplanes with tandem seating normally have a limitation  requiring solo flight to be made from the front seat in some  airplanes or the rear seat in others. Some of the smaller  helicopters also require solo flight be made from a specific seat, either the right, left, or center. These seating limitations  are noted by a placard, usually on the instrument panel, and  they should be strictly followed.  

As an aircraft ages, its weight usually increases due to debris  and dirt collecting in hard-to-reach locations and moisture  absorbed in the cabin insulation. This increase in weight is  normally small, but it can be determined only by accurately  weighing the aircraft.  

Changes of fixed equipment may have a major effect upon  the weight of the aircraft. Many aircraft are overloaded by  the installation of extra radios or instruments. Fortunately,  the replacement of older, heavy electronic equipment with  newer, lighter types results in a weight reduction. This  weight change, however helpful, can cause the CG to shift,  which must be computed and annotated in the weight and  balance record.  

Repairs and alterations are the major sources of weight  changes. It is the responsibility of the FAA-certificate   mechanic or repairman making any repair or alteration to  know the weight and location of a change, to compute the  CG, record the new empty weight and EWCG in the aircraft  weight and balance record, and update the equipment lists.  

If the newly calculated EWCG should happen to fall outside  the EWCG range, it is necessary to perform an adverse- loading check. This requires a forward and rearward  adverse-loading check and a maximum weight check.  These weight and balance extreme conditions represent the  maximum forward and rearward CG position for the aircraft.  An adverse-loading check is a deliberate attempt to load an  aircraft in a manner that creates the most critical balance  condition and still remains within the design CG limits of the  aircraft. If any of the checks fall outside the loaded CG range,  the aircraft must be reconfigured or placarded to prevent the  pilot from loading the aircraft improperly. It is sometimes  possible to install a fixed ballast in order for the aircraft to  operate again within the normal CG range.  

The  FAA-certifi cated mechanic or repairman conducting an  annual or condition inspection must ensure the weight and  balance data in the aircraft records is current and accurate. It  is the responsibility of the PIC to use the most current weight  and balance data when operating the aircraft.  

# Stability and Balance Control  

Balance control refers to the location of the CG of an aircraft.  This is of primary importance to aircraft stability, which is a  factor in flight safety. The CG is the point at which the total  weight of the aircraft is assumed to be concentrated, and the  CG must be located within specificlimits for safe flight.Both  lateral and longitudinal balance are important, but the prime  concern is longitudinal balance; that is, the location of the  CG along the longitudinal or lengthwise axis.  

An airplane is designed to have stability that allows it to be  trimmed to maintain straight-and-level flight with hands off  the controls. Longitudinal stability is maintained by ensuring  the CG is slightly ahead of the center of lift. This produces a  fixed nose-down force independent of the airspeed. This is  balanced by a variable nose-up force, which is produced by a  downward aerodynamic force on the horizontal tail surfaces  

![](images/5519b08df14260541fdd4d02298b3fecec6e419a133b96ce519d768be8e69c88.jpg)  
Figure 1-1.  Longitudinal forces acting on an airplane in flight.  

that varies directly with the airspeed.  [Figure 1-1] If a rising air current should cause the nose to pitch up, the  airplane slows and the downward force on the tail decreases.  The weight concentrated at the CG pulls the nose back down.  If the nose should drop in flight, the airspeed increases and  the increased downward tail load brings the nose back up  to level flight  

As long as the CG is maintained within the allowable limits  for its weight, the airplane has adequate longitudinal stability  

![](images/e48ea59afcd67bbc9b3bad7ec2fa785f48d24fd4ccdef4715b3325a86821d9e5.jpg)  
Figure 1-2.  If the CG is too far aft at the low stall airspeed, there  might not be enough elevator nose-down authority to get the nose  down for recovery.  

and control. If the CG is too far aft, it is too near the center  of lift; the airplane is unstable and difficult to recover from  a stall.  [Figure 1-2]  If the unstable airplane should enter a  spin, the spin could become flat making recovery difficult or impossible. If the CG is too far forward, the downward  tail load needs to be increased to maintain level flight. This  increased tail load has the same effect as carrying additional  weight; the aircraft must fly at a higher angle of attack and  drag increases.  

A more serious problem caused by the CG being too far  forward is the lack of sufficient elevator authority. At low  takeoff speeds, the elevator might not produce enough  nose-up force to rotate; on landing there may not be enough  elevator force to flarethe airplane.  [Figure 1-3]  Both takeoff  and landing runs are lengthened if the CG is too far forward. The basic aircraft design is such that lateral symmetry is  assumed to exist. For each item of weight added to the left  of the center line of the aircraft (also known as buttock  line zero or BL‑0), there is generally an equal weight at a  corresponding location on the right.  

![](images/28fa1cb82fb484d4bfe93360143c4a9b81b4e6ecfdbe0a696ee215848c1592cd.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.  If the CG is too far forward, there is not enough elevator  nose-up force to flare the airplane for landing.  

The lateral balance can be upset by uneven fuel loading  or burnoff. The position of the lateral CG is not normally  computed for an airplane, but the pilot must be aware of  the adverse effects that result from a laterally unbalanced  condition.  [Figure 1-4]  This is corrected by using the aileron  trim tab until enough fuel has been used from the tank on  the heavy side to balance the airplane. The deflectedtrim tab  deflects the aileron to produce additional lift on the heavy  side, but it also produces additional drag, and the airplane  flies inefficientl  

![](images/5a611d1f03a07e79b49296a5456b488d2605e6b4beb25e003d0cee773bf1132d.jpg)  
Figure 1-4.  Lateral imbalance causes wing heaviness, which may  be corrected by deflecting the aileron. The additional lift causes  additional drag, and the airplane flies inefficiently.  

Helicopters are more often affected by lateral imbalance  than airplanes. If a helicopter is loaded with heavy occupants  and fuel on the same side, it could be out of balance enough  to make it unsafe to fly. It is also possible that if external  loads are carried in such a position that requires large lateral  displacement of the cyclic control to maintain level fl ght, the  fore-and-aft cyclic control effectiveness is limited.  

Swept-wing airplanes are more critical due to fuel imbalance  because as the fuel is used from the outboard tanks, the CG  shifts forward. As fuel is used from the inboard tanks, the CG  shifts aft.  [Figure 1-5]  For this reason, fuel-use scheduling  in swept-wing airplanes operation is critical.  

# Weight Control for Aircraft Other Than  Fixed and Rotor-wing  

Some light aircraft utilize different methods of determining  weight and balance from the traditional fixedand rotor-wing  aircraft. These aircraft achieve flight control by methods  different from the fixed-wing airplane or helicopter. Most  notable of these are weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft (also  known as trikes), powered parachutes, and balloons. These  aircraft typically do not specify either an EWCG or a CG  range. They require only a certified or approved maximum  weight. To understand why this is so, a look at how flight control is achieved is helpful.  

Airplanes and WSC aircraft control flightunder the influenc   of the same four forces (lift, gravity, thrust, and drag), and  around the same three axes (pitch, yaw, and roll). However,  each aircraft accomplishes this control in a very different  manner. This difference helps explain why the fixed-wing  

![](images/378a27aff8e80c45a7ba8a63c7387f192fdaa434e7fed221675aa1b5534e5298.jpg)  
Figure 1-5.  Fuel in the tanks of a swept-wing airplane affects both  lateral and longitudinal balance. As fuel is used from an outboard  tank, the CG shifts forward.  

airplane requires an established weight and a known CG,  whereas the WSC aircraft only requires the known weight.  

The fixed-wing airplane has movable controls that alter lift  on various airfoil surfaces to vary pitch, roll, and yaw. In  turn, these changes in lift affect the characteristics of the  flight parameters. Weight normally decreases in flight due  to fuel consumption, and the airplane CG changes with this  weight reduction. An airplane utilizes its variable fligh   controls to compensate and maintain controllability through  the various flightmodes and as the CG changes. An airplane  has a CG range or envelope within which it must remain if  the flight controls are to remain effective and the airplane  safely operated.  

# Weight-Shift Control Aircraft  

The WSC aircraft has a relatively set platform wing without  a tail. The pilot achieves control by shifting weight. In the  design of this aircraft, the weight of the airframe and its  payload is attached to the wing at a single point in a pendulous  arrangement. The pilot, through the  fl ight controls, controls the  arm of this pendulum and thereby controls the aircraft. When  a change in flight parameter is desired, the pilot displaces the  aircraft’s weight by the appropriate distance and direction.  This change momentarily disrupts the equilibrium between the  four forces acting on the aircraft. The wing, due to its inherent  stability, then moves appropriately to reestablish the desired  relationship between these forces; the wing flexes and alter   its shape. As the shape is changed, lift is varied at different  points on the wing to achieve the desired flight parameters  

The flight controls primarily affect the pitch-and-roll axes.  Since there is no vertical tail plane, there is minimal or no  yaw control. Unlike in an airplane, the CG experienced by  the WSC aircraft wing remains constant. Since the weight  of the airframe acts through a single point (the wing attach  point), the range over which the weight may act is fixed at  the pendulum arm or length. Even though weight decreases  as fuel is consumed, weight remains focused at the wing  attach point. Because the range is fixed, there is no need to  establish a calculated range. The pilot should consult the  POH or Aircraft Operating Instructions (AOI) for maximum  takeoff weight and minimum and maximum seat weight  limits prior to each flight  

# Powered Parachutes  

The powered parachute is also a pendulum-style aircraft. Its  airframe CG is fixed at the pendulum attach point. It is more  limited in controllability than the WSC aircraft because it  lacks an aerodynamic pitch control. Pitch (and lift) control  is primarily a function of the power control. Increased power  results in increased lift; cruise power amounts to level flight; decreased power causes a descent. Due to this characteristic,  the aircraft is basically a one-airspeed aircraft. Once again,  because the CG is fixed at the attach point to the wing, there  is no CG range. As with WSC, the pilot should consult the  POH or AOI for maximum takeoff weight and minimum and  maximum seat weight limits prior to each flight  

Roll control on a powered parachute is achieved by changing  the shape of the wing. The change is achieved by varying  the length of steering lines attached to the outboard trailing  edges of the wing. The trailing edge of the parachute is pulled  down slightly on one side or the other to create increased  drag along that side. This change in drag creates roll and  yaw, permitting the aircraft to be steered.  

# Balloons  

The balloon is controlled by the pilot only in the vertical  dimension; this is in contrast to all other aircraft. He or she  achieves this control through the use of lift and weight.  Wind provides all other movement. The CG of the gondola  remains constant beneath the balloon envelope. As in WSC  and powered-parachute aircraft, there is no CG limitation.  

# Underestimating the Importance of  Weight and Balance  

Many pilots, from sport pilot to commercial pilot, tend to  underestimate the importance of proper weight and balance  of their aircraft. Load sheets are taken for granted and hasty  calculations are made of the aircraft’s CG. Unfortunately,  each year there are a number of accidents related to weight  and balance issues. Many of these occurrences could have  been avoided had more attention been given to weight and  balance.  

Every student pilot is taught how to work a weight and  balance problem and that it is important to make sure  every flight is loaded “within the envelope” (no more than  maximum gross weight) for both takeoff and landing. But  does he or she really understand just why this is so and the  disastrous effect of being out of the envelope? Two examples  of documented cases are provided below in an effort to  indicate the serious nature of maintaining the proper weight  and balance. In case studies when weight and balance was  listed as the major factor of the accident, many were fatal.  

For instance, a small aircraft was loaded with hunters, gear,  and dogs (none of the dogs were secured inside the aircraft).  During takeoff, all the dogs went to the aft of the airplane.  This shifted the CG well aft of its allowable limit. The  airplane stalled and crashed. The airplane was destroyed  with casualties.  

Another accident occurred when a group of skydivers were  sitting on the floor toward the aft portion of the airplane  (they were unsecured). During takeoff, the CG was again  well beyond its aft limit. The airplane stalled and crashed.  The airplane was destroyed with casualties.  

There is a safety factor built into the formula for maximum  gross weight. Any airplane can fly when it takes off at a  weight greater than maximum gross weight if the runway  is long enough and the density altitude is low enough.  However, landing is a different matter. All airplanes are built  to withstand an occasional hard landing, but what would  happen if the hard landing were combined with a substantially  overweight airplane? Something would probably break at that  time or the structure would be weakened enough to break  sometime in the future when everything might seem normal to  a pilot unaware of the previous situation. Even more disastrous  than an overweight, hard landing is reaching or exceeding  the structural integrity of the metal and/or composite design  values when maneuvering or when turbulence is encountered.  Hidden damage could result, causing an unexpected  catastrophic failure at some future time.  

If an airplane is certificated with a maximum gross weight  of 6,000 pounds (its weight on the ground) and is rolled into  a   $60^{\circ}$   bank, the forces exerted make it feel as if it weighed  12,000 pounds. At its maximum certificated gross weight,  there is no problem because the aircraft is operated within its  certificated maneuvering loads. But loaded to 8,000 pounds  with a   $60^{\circ}$   bank or an abrupt pullup, it suddenly weighs  16,000 pounds and might not be able to perform! Even if it  could, there would probably be internal stress damage that  would show up on future flights

# Weight and Balance Theory  

# Introduction  

Weight and balance in aircraft is based on the law of the lever.  This chapter discusses the application of the law of the lever  and its applications relative to locating the balance point of a  beam or lever on which various weights are located or shifted.  The chapter also discusses the documentation pertaining to  weight and balance that is furnished by the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) and aircraft manufacturers.  

![](images/688ce1261a85ab0b19baa594e22423936063c0477c83450c280c4650a85ad0e8.jpg)  

# Weight and Balance Theory  

Two elements are vital in the weight and balance considerations  of an aircraft.  

•	 The total weight of the aircraft must be no greater  than the maximum weight allowed by the FAA for  the make and model of the aircraft. •	 The center of gravity (CG), or the point at which  all of the weight of the aircraft is considered to be  concentrated, must be maintained within the allowable  range for the operational weight of the aircraft.  

# Arm  

The arm is usually measured and expressed in inches and  refers to the horizontal distance between the CG of an item  or object and the datum, a point from where all measurements  are taken. Arms to the left of the datum are negative   $(-)$   and  those to the right of the datum are positive  $(+)$  . The datum is an  imaginary vertical plane from which all horizontal distances  are measured for balance purposes. The position of the  reference datum varies by aircraft design and manufacturer.  When the datum is located off of the lever and to the left, all of  the arms are positive and computational errors are minimized.  Note: When the datum is established ahead of the aircraft, for  example at the aircraft nose, all of the arms are positive and  computational errors are minimized.  

# Moment  

A moment is a force that tries to cause rotation and is the  product of the arm, in inches, and the weight, in pounds.  Moments are generally expressed in pound-inches (lb-in)  and may be either positive or negative.  

# The Law of the Lever  

Weight and balance problems are based on the physical law  of the lever. This law states that a lever is balanced when the  weight on one side of the fulcrum (a pivot point for the lever)  multiplied by its arm is equal to the weight on the opposite  side multiplied by its arm. In other words, the lever is balanced  when the sum of the moments about the fulcrum is zero. This  is the condition in which the positive moments (those that  try to rotate the lever clockwise) are equal to the negative  moments (those that try to rotate it counterclockwise). In an  aircraft, the balance point is referred to as the CG.  

One of the easiest ways to understand weight and balance is  to consider a lever with weights placed at various locations.  The balance point or CG of the lever can be changed by either  moving the weights closer or farther from the fulcrum or by  increasing or decreasing the weights. The balance point or  CG of a lever may be determined by using these four steps:  

1.	 Measure the arm of each weight in inches from the  datum.  

2.	 Multiply each arm by its weight in pounds to determine  the moment in pound-inches of each weight. 3.	 Determine the total of all weights and of all the  moments. (Disregard the weight of the lever). 4.	 Divide the total moment by the total weight to  determine the balance point.  

Consider these facts about the lever in  Figure 2-1 . The  100-pound weight A is located 50 inches to the left of the  fulcrum (the datum, in this instance), and it has a moment of
  $100\times-50\!=\!-5\!,\!000$   lb-in. The 200-pound weight B is located  25 inches to the right of the fulcrum, and its moment is
  $200\,\times\,+25=+5{,}000$   lb-in. In  Figure 2-2,  the sum of the  moments is  $-5,\!000+5,\!000\!=\!0$  , and the lever is balanced. The  forces that try to rotate it clockwise have the same magnitude  as those that try to rotate it counterclockwise. If either weight  is moved or changed, the balance point or CG changes and  the lever becomes unbalanced.

In  Figure 2-3,  the datum is located off the lever to the left  of weight A. Using the information provided in  Figure 2-3,  

![](images/257f041745c1f58c03723ec873e5e4c086db55bfcec2eecd47808de268a63899.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Balance lever datum located off the lever.  

determine the balance point by making a chart like the one  in  Figure 2-4 .  

![Figure 2-4.  Finding balance point with datum located off the lever. ](images/c0567a4357f90c783afb8df69af877d7dcfb03f32d5d485d6157fce86e8566b5.jpg)  

As noted in  Figure 2-4 , A weighs 100 pounds and is 50 inches  from the datum; B weighs 100 pounds and is 90 inches from  the datum; C weighs 200 pounds and is 150 inches from the  datum. The total of the weights is 400 pounds, and the total  moment is 44,000 lb-in.  

Determine the balance point by dividing the total moment  by the total weight. A balance point is equal to the CG and  can be mathematically written as:  

$$
\mathrm{CG}={\frac{\mathrm{total~moment}}{\mathrm{total~weight}}}
$$  

To prove this is the correct balance, move the datum to a  location 110 inches to the right of the original datum and  determine the arm of each weight from this new datum.  [Figure 2-5]  Then, make a new chart similar to the one in  Figure 2-6 . If the balance point is correct, the sum of the  moments is zero.  

![](images/1c63bf45919cfd37dce8e95a59aa3d69e8d40cdb4012f7e53918f5448d036e1d.jpg)  
Figure 2-5.  Locating balance point.  

![Figure 2-6.  Proving balance point with three weights is correct. ](images/098f1ae16030dba6e3bde275574e7a3e0c2e5f763f51f401cfec7209ff26eb7d.jpg)  

its arm is negative or  $-60$   inches. The new arm of weight B is  20 inches (110 – 90), and it is also to the left of the datum, so  it is  $-20$  ; the new arm of weight C is 40 inches (150 – 110).  It is to the right of the datum and is therefore positive.  

The lever is balanced when the sum of the moments is zero.  The location of the datum used for determining the arms of  the weights is not important; it may be in various locations,  but all of the measurements must be made from the same  datum location.  

The procedure for  fi nding the balance point is the same  anywhere the datum is located. In  Figure 2-7,  the datum is  located at C. Weight A has an arm of –100 inches (negative  because it is to the left) of the datum and weight B has an  arm of   $-60$   inches from the datum. The table in  Figure 2-8   is used to determine the new balance point.  

![](images/e29ce82fa158c380a123f6374d5522268afffab063d3c937d2519dc3435ebca2.jpg)  

![Figure 2-7.  Locating balance point with datum at  $C$  . ](images/1b65eae8e9658abf884881c02f19c6cbced0b423d6318c81e68309cc7415b73c.jpg)  

To verify that this is the correct balance point, move the datum  40 inches to the left of the original datum and determine the  arm of each weight from this new datum as in  Figure 2-9 .  

![](images/f62957abb42afb5fbea0bdc9c3a7062c975b2b28e73555968922ecaec9d7ac8c.jpg)  
Figure 2-9.  Locating balance point with datum left of original.  

The new arm of weight A is 60 inches (the difference between  110 and 50), and since this weight is to the left of the datum,  The new arm for weight A would be   $-100+40=-60$  ; for  weight B,  $-60+40=-20$  ; and point C, is  $+40$  . The lever is  balanced and the balance point is correct when the sum of  the moments is zero.  [Figure 2-10]  

![](images/5207b9df0f50117e21bcb14a97e180d1689b12ed50515918f4a06c33a067c07b.jpg)  

# Shifting the Balance Point or CG  

One common weight and balance problem involves moving  or shifting weight from one point to another in order to move  the balance point or CG to a desired location. This can be  demonstrated by using a lever with three weights to work  out the problem.  

# Solution by Chart  

As the lever is loaded in  Figure 2-11,  it balances at a point  72 inches from the CG of weight A.  

![](images/06018aea31f42f0287862108d64a5859b8bb0cbab60246f93e1bdac6bc10c1b7.jpg)  
Figure 2-11.  Locating balance point with three weights.  

To shift weight B so the lever balances about its center, 50  inches from the CG of weight A, first determine the arm of  weight B that produces a moment that causes the total moment  of all three weights around this desired balance point to be  zero. The combined moment of weights A and C around this  new balance point is 5,000 lb-in, so the moment of weight B  must be  $\mathbf{-5,}000$   lb-in for the lever to balance.  [Figure 2-12]  

![Figure 2-12.  Proving the new balance point is correct. ](images/4c3c016aee7b74058a3b19b1d23ed641365d9da00e50192145f58cb23bfaba61.jpg)  

Determine the arm of weight B by dividing its moment,   $\mathbf{-5,}000$   lb-in, by its weight of 200 pounds. The arm is  $-25$  inches. To balance the lever at its center, weight B must be  placed so its CG is 25 inches to the left of the center of the  lever.  [Figure 2-13]  

![](images/1e130330e35a97469363075217c0e09ea2781f44971f6184f20be670420af5e3.jpg)  
Figure 2-13.  Weight distribution to balance lever.  

Figure 2-14  indicates that the shift in weight depicted in  Figure 2-13  allows the lever to balance as the sum of the  moments is zero.  

![Figure 2-14.  Weight shift provides correct CG. ](images/ed8c29942505361565291cc1ca6b0c0f11c03321009498f949a52191e1861529.jpg)  

# Basic Weight and Balance Equation  

The following formulas can be used to determine the distance  weight must be shifted to obtain a desired change in the CG  location. The equation can also be rearranged to fi d the  amount of weight required to be shifted to move the CG  to a desired location, to find the distance the CG is moved  when a specified amount of weight is shifted, or to find the  total weight that would allow shifting a specified amount of  weight to move the CG a given distance.  

Weight to be shifted =                ∆ CG       Total weight	        Distance weight is shifted  Weight shifted × Distance weight is shifted Total weight  $=$                                                        ∆ CG  Total weight shifted × ∆ CG Weight shifted  $=

$                                Distance weight is shifted  Weight shifted × Distance weight is shifted

 ∆ CG =

                                     Total weight  Total weight × ∆ CG Distance weight is shifted  $=$                                                    Weight shifted  

# Solution by Formula  

The problem in  Figure 2-11  can be solved by using variations  of this basic equation. First, rearrange the formula to  determine the distance weight B must be shifted:  

![](images/1ac6a1691192783bcbf4b3306b183e90f0a7df61bbb38dbd4c2e70e27936ffd7.jpg)  

The CG of the lever in  Figure 2-11  was 72 inches from the  datum. This CG can be shifted to the center of the lever as in  Figure 2-13  by moving weight B. If the 200-pound weight B  is moved 55 inches to the left, the CG shifts from  $+72$   inches  to  $+50$   inches, a distance of 22 inches.  

When the distance the weight is to be shifted is known,  the amount of weight to be shifted to move the CG to any  location can be determined by another arrangement of the  basic equation. Use the following arrangement of the formula  to determine the amount of weight that has to be shifted from  station 8 to station   $+25$  , to move the CG from station  $+72$  to station  $+50$  .  

Total weight × ∆ CG Weight shifted  $=

$  	              Distance weight is shifted

 	           = 500 × 22

                                 55

                          $=200$   inches  

If the 200-pound weight B is shifted from station   $+80$   to  station  $+25$  , the CG moves from station  $+72$   to station   $+50$  .  

A third arrangement of this basic equation is used to  determine the amount the CG is shifted when a given amount  of weight is moved for a specified distance (as it was done  in  Figure 2-11 ). The following formula is used to determine  the amount the CG is shifted when 200-pound weight B is  moved from  $+80$   to  $+25$  .  

Weight shifted × Distance it is shifted

  $\Delta$   CG =

 	 	   Total weight

           = 200 × 55  $=\frac{200\times55}{500}

$  	

            $=22$   inches  

Moving weight B from  $+80$   to  $+25$   moves the CG 22 inches  from its original location at   $+72$   to its new location at   $+50$  as seen in  Figure 2-13 .  

To complete the calculations, return to the original formula  and enter the appropriate numbers.  

![](images/e4047f6e1216a95cf892a9aa283ccfda8f3be92c9d2b3083d872a39ca7ddc7fa.jpg)  

The equation is balanced.  

# Mean Aerodynamic Chord  

The CG point affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure  the aircraft is safe to fly, the CG must fall within specified limits established by the manufacturer.  

On some aircraft, the CG is expressed as a percentage of the  length of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) or “percent  MAC.”  [Figure 2-14]  In order to make such a calculation,  the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known  ahead of time.  

![](images/9f5494dd805de44edb4d70a9a7e58e8599c5741f8c4cfda3c51177149d1a590a.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  Center of gravity expressed as percent mean  aerodynamic chord.  

CG limits are specified forward and aft and/or lateral (left and  right) limits within which the aircraft’s CG must be located  during flight. The area between the limits is called the CG  range of the aircraft.  

The position of the fore and aft CG limits is measured as a  percentage of MAC from the MAC leading edge. Usually for  a single or two-seat aircraft, the most forward position would  be forward of 30–35 percent MAC. Thus, the allowable CG  range in a light aircraft should not exceed 20 percent MAC.  

Note: For a rectangular width of constant airfoil section  dimensions, MAC is just the chord. For a symmetrically- tapered wing, it is the average of the root chord and the tip  chord.  

# FAA-Furnished Weight and Balance  Information  

The information discussed to this point can be readily applied  to any aircraft weight and balance problem. To apply the  techniques, certain elements of information are required.  This information is obtained from both FAA documents and  manufacturer provided data.  

Before an aircraft CG can be computed, certain information  must be known. This information, furnished by the FAA  for every certificated aircraft in the Type Certificate Data  Sheets (TCDS) or Aircraft Specifications, can be accessed  at www.faa.gov. When the design of an aircraft is approved  by the FAA, an Approved Type Certificate and TCDS are  issued. The TCDS includes all of the pertinent specification   for the aircraft; at each annual or 100-hour inspection, it is  the responsibility of the inspecting mechanic or repairman  to ensure that the aircraft adheres to them. A note about the  TCDS: aircraft certifi ated before January 1, 1958, were  issued Aircraft Specifica ions under the Civil Air Regulations 

 (CARs), but when the Civil Aeronautical Administration 

 (CAA) was replaced by the FAA, Aircraft Specification   were replaced by the TCDS.  

The weight and balance information on a TCDS includes CG  range, empty weight CG range (EWCG), maximum weights,  number of seats, maximum baggage, fuel capacity, oil  capacity, and datum location. Data pertinent to an individual  model is located in its respective section of the TCDS. Use  the TCDS excerpts in  Figure 2-15  to verify the following for  a Cirrus Design Corporation SR 20 normal category:  

# CG Range  

S/N 1005 through 1147:  

Forward Limits: 138.7 inches at 2,110 lb with a straight line  taper to 141.0 in at 2,694 lb and 143.0 in at 2,900 lb  

Aft Limits: 144.6 in at 2,110 lb, with straight line taper to  147.4 in at 2,570 lb, and to 147.9 in at 2,745 lb, and 148.2  in at 2,900 lb  

S/N 1148 through 1877, 1879 through 1885, and S/N 1005  through 1147 if Cirrus Service Bulletin SB 20-01-00 is  complied with: Forward Limits: 138.7 in at 2,110 lb with a straight line taper  to 141.0 in at 2,694 lb and 144.1 in at 3,000 lb  

Aft Limits: 144.6 in at 2,110 lb, with straight line taper to  147.4 in at 2,570 lb, and to 148.1 in at 2,900 lb, and 148.0  in at 3,000 lb  

S/N 1878, 1886 and Subsequent: Forward Limits: 137.8 in at 2,100 lb with a straight line taper  to 139.1 in at 2,700 lb, and to 140.7 in at 3,050 lb  

Aft Limits: 148.1 in at 2,100 lb, with straight line to 148.1  in at 3,050 lb  

# Empty Weight CG Range (EWCG)  

When all of the seats and baggage compartments are located  close together, it is not possible (as long as the EWCG is  located within the EWCG range) to legally load the aircraft  so that its operational CG falls outside this allowable range.  If the seats and baggage areas extend over a wide range, the  EWCG range is listed as “None.”  

# Maximum Weights  

The maximum allowable takeoff and landing weights and  the maximum allowable ramp weight are given. This basic  information may be altered by a note. Notes are found in data  pertinent to all models. An example would be Note 6 at the  end of  Figure 2-15.  

# Number of Seats  

The number of seats and their arms are given in such terms  as: 4 (2 at 143.5 aft of datum, 2 at 180 aft of datum).  

# Maximum Baggage  

Maximum baggage for this model is 130 pounds at 208  inches.  

# Fuel Capacity  

This important information is given in such terms as: 60.5  gal at 153.75 in. Usable: 56 gal (See Note 1). Notes can be  found in data pertinent to all models.  

# Oil Capacity (Wet Sump)  

The quantity of the full oil supply and its arm are given: 8  quarts at 76.2 in.

# Data Pertinent to all Models  

The location of the datum is specified and is described, for  example, as: 100 inches in front of the forward face of the  firewall bulkhead.  

# Manufacturer-Furnished Information  

When an aircraft is initially certificated,its empty weight and  EWCG are determined and recorded in the weight and balance  record, such as the one in  Figure 2-16 . Notice in this figur   that the moment is expressed as “Moment (lb-in/1,000).” This  is a moment index, which means that the moment, a very  large number, has been divided by 1,000 to make it more  manageable. Chapter 4, Light Sport Aircraft—Weight and  Balance Control, discusses moment indices in more detail.

Figure 2-17  is from a  comprehensive equipment list that includes all of the items  of equipment approved for this particular model of aircraft.  The pilot’s operating handbook (POH) for each individual  aircraft includes an aircraft-s pecifi c equipment list of the  items from this master list. When any item is added to or  removed from the aircraft, its weight and arm are determined  in the equipment list and used to update the weight and  balance record. The POH and airplane flight manual (AFM)  also contain CG moment envelopes and loading graphs.  Examples of the use of these helpful graphs are given in  Chapter 5, Single-Engine Aircraft Weight and Balance  Computations.  

In addition to the weight and balance report and equipment  list, the manufacturer also provides a CG range chart. The  CG range can be found in text form in the TCDS. The CG  range chart is furnished in the POH.

# Chapter 3 Weighing the Aircraft and  Determining the Empty Weight  Center of Gravity  

# Introduction  

Chapter 2, Weight and Balance Theory, explained the theory  of weight and balance and gave examples of the way the  center of gravity (CG) could be found for a lever loaded  with several weights. In this chapter, the practical aspects  of weighing an airplane and locating its CG are discussed.  Formulas are introduced that allow the CG location to be  measured in inches from various datum locations and in  percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC).

# Requirements  

Regulations do not require periodic weighing of privately  owned and operated aircraft. Such aircraft are usually  weighed when originally certificatedor after major alterations  that can affect the weight and balance. The primary purpose  of aircraft weight and balance control is safety. Manufacturers  conduct extensive flight tests to establish loading limits  for their aircraft because limit information is critical for  safe flight. A secondary purpose is to aid efficiency during  flight. Overloading of the aircraft is not the only concern;  the distribution of the weight is important also. The aircraft  has CG limits, and any loading that places the CG outside  the established limits seriously impairs controllability of  the aircraft.  

Weight and balance is of such vital importance that each  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificated  mechanic or repairman maintaining an aircraft must be fully  aware of his or her responsibility to provide the pilot with  current and accurate information for the actual weight of the  aircraft and the location of the CG. The pilot in command  (PIC) is responsible for knowing the weight of the load, CG,  maximum allowable weight, and CG limits of the aircraft.  The weight and balance report must include an equipment  list showing weights and moment arms of all required and  optional items of equipment included in the certificate   empty weight.  

Weight and balance records used in accounting for and  correcting the CG location are reliable for only limited  periods of time. For this reason, periodic aircraft weighing is  desirable. An aircraft should be reweighed and a new weight  and balance record should be started after the aircraft has  undergone extensive repair or major alteration, when the pilot  reports unsatisfactory flight characteristics (e.g., nose or tail  heaviness), and when recorded weight and balance data are  suspected to be in error.  

Repairs and alterations are major sources of weight change.  The airframe and powerplant (A&P) FAA-certificated  mechanic or repairman who is responsible for making any  repair or alteration must:  

1.	 Establish by computation that the authorized weight  and CG limits as shown in the type certificate data  sheet (TCDS) and aircraft specifications are not  exceeded, and 2.	 Record the new empty weight center of gravity  (EWCG) data in the current approved aircraft flight manual or issued operating limitations.  

When an aircraft has undergone extensive repair or major  alteration, it should be reweighed and a new weight and  balance record started. The A&P FAA-certificated mechanic  or repairman responsible for the work must provide the pilot  with current and accurate aircraft weight information and  location of the EWCG.  

# Equipment for Weighing  

Weighing aircraft with accurately calibrated scales is the only  sure method of obtaining an accurate empty weight and CG  location. The two basic types of scales used to weigh aircraft  are platform and load cell.  

Platform scales  [Figure 3-1]  or ramp wheel scales  [Figure 3-2]  (usually a form or modified version of the  platform scale) are low profi e, easy to handle, safe, and  reliable. Tow or push the aircraft wheels or skids onto the  scale pad at ground level. With one scale per wheel, each  device should be capable of measuring up to at least 60,000  pounds since the weight on each wheel rarely exceeds this  figure  

![](images/5ee4728679cd7151faa9ef7fa7ed510964f21232fc8cd0a51128c39f5c70af39.jpg)  
Figure 3-1.  Platform scales.  

Load cell scales [Figure 3-3] are also a reliable means to  weigh aircraft and are typically cheaper than the platform  type.Using load cell scales allows for the aircraft to be set  up and weighed in its level flight attitude. With this method,  the aircraft is placed on jacks with electronic load cells  placed between the jack and the jack pad on the aircraft.  The aircraft is raised on the jacks until the wheels or skids  are off the floor and the aircraft is in a level flight attitude.  The weight measured by each load cell is indicated on the  control panel. Jacking an aircraft off the ground from all  load points can be an inconvenience, as well as a safety  risk, which some operators would rather avoid by opting for  more expensive—but simpler to use—platform equipment.  In addition, weighing with platform scales typically takes  only one-third of the time needed to weigh with load cells.

Figure 3-3.  Load cell scales.  

All scales for aviation use, manual or electronic, must be  protected when stored or shipped, and they must be checked  periodically for accuracy. The maximum recognized period  between calibration checks is 12 months; however, this period  may be reduced by an airworthiness authority dependent on  the conditions of use. Scales in daily use may require a shorter  interval and/or testing to determine the continued accuracy  of the unit. Scales should be returned to the manufacturer for  proper calibration and testing.  

# Preparation for Weighing  

In general, weight procedures may vary with the aircraft  and types of weight equipment employed. The weighing  procedure contained in the manufacturer’s maintenance  manual should be followed for each particular aircraft. The  major considerations in preparing an aircraft for weighing  are described in the following paragraphs.  

# Scale Preparation  

Mechanical and electronic scales shall be inspected prior to  use and set to zero. This is done by adding and removing  a weight, then rechecking for zero. This process should be  repeated until a steady zero setting is obtained. The scales  should be located in the same environment in which they  are to be used and allowed to come up to temperature at  least 2 hours prior to use. Scales should not be used in  temperature extremes below  $40\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or above  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   unless the  scale is specifically designed for use in those temperatures.  Electronic scales are very sensitive and, if subjected to  freezing temperatures, the liquid displays may be damaged  beyond use.  

# Weigh Clean Aircraft Inside Hangar  

The aircraft should be weighed inside a hangar where wind  cannot blow over the surface and cause fluctuating or false  scale readings. The aircraft should be clean inside and out,  with special attention paid to the bilge area to ensure that no  water or debris is trapped there. The outside of the aircraft  should be as free as possible of all mud and dirt.  

# Equipment List  

All of the required equipment must be properly installed, and  there should be no equipment installed that is not included in  the equipment list. If such equipment is installed, the weight  and balance record must be corrected to indicate it.  

# Ballast  

All required permanent ballasts must be properly secured in  place. All temporary ballasts must be removed.  

# Standard Weights  

Standard weights are established weights for numerous items  involved in weight and balance computations. These weights  should not be used if actual weights are available. Some of  the standard weights are listed in  Figure 3-4 .  

![](images/0dbf4c4c3a09016eb4245731c191d0cfdf9cce9b14a58d26450c43a83b2c46f2.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.  Standard fuels and weights with temperatures of  $\cdot32\,^{\circ}\!F$  and   $59\ ^{\circ}F.$  .  

Note the difference in weight as temperatures change.  Although this change is a very small amount per gallon, it could  end up in a significant total weight gain when dealing with large  quantities of fluids,such as those found in commercial aircraft.  

# Draining the Fuel  

Drain fuel from the tanks in the manner specified by the  aircraft manufacturer. If there are no specific instructions,  drain the fuel until the fuel quantity gauges read empty when  the aircraft is in level-flight attitude. Any fuel remaining in  the system is considered residual or unusable fuel and is part  of the aircraft empty weight.  

The amount of residual fuel and its arm are normally found  in Note 1 in the section of the Type Certificate Data Sheets  (TCDS), “Data pertaining to all Models.” For additional fuel  capacity information, see Chapter 2, Weight and Balance  Theory.  

If it is not feasible to drain the fuel, the tanks can be topped  off to be sure of the quantity they contain and the aircraft  weighed with full fuel. After weighing is complete, the  weight of the fuel and its moment are subtracted from those  of the aircraft as weighed. To correct the empty weight for  the residual fuel, add its weight and moment.  

When computing the weight of the fuel (e.g., a tank full of  jet fuel), measure its specific gravity (sg) with a hydrometer  and multiply it by 8.345 (the nominal weight of 1 gallon of  pure water whose sg is 1.0). If the ambient temperature is  high and the jet fuel in the tank is hot enough for its specific gravity to reach 0.81 rather than its nominal sg of 0.82, the  fuel actually weighs 6.76 pounds per gallon rather than its  normal weight of 6.84 pounds per gallon.  

# Oil  

The empty weight for aircraft certificated under the Civilian  Air Regulations (CAR) part 3 does not include the engine  lubricating oil. The oil must either be drained before the  aircraft is weighed, or its weight must be subtracted from  the scale readings to determine the empty weight. To weigh  an aircraft that does not include the engine lubricating oil  as part of the empty weight, place it in level flight attitude,  then open the drain valves and allow the oil to drain out.  Any remaining is undrainable oil and is part of the empty  weight. Aircraft certificated under Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) parts 23 and 25 include full  oil as part of the empty weight. If it is impractical to drain the  oil, the reservoir can be filled to the specified level and the  weight of the oil computed at 7.5 pounds per gallon. Then,  its weight and moment are subtracted from the weight and  moment of the aircraft as weighed. The amount and arm of  the undrainable oil are found in Note 1 of the TCDS, and  this must be added to the empty weight.  

# Other Fluids  

The hydraulic fluid reservoir and all other reservoirs  containing fluidsrequired for normal operation of the aircraft  should be full. Fluids not considered to be part of the empty  weight of the aircraft are potable (drinkable) water, lavatory  precharge water, and water for injection into the engines.  

conditions of both longitudinal and lateral level.  

# Configuration of the Aircraf  

Consult the aircraft service manual regarding position of  the landing gear shock struts and the control surfaces for  weighing. When weighing a helicopter, the main rotor must  be in its correct position.  

# Jacking the Aircraft  

Aircraft are often weighed by rolling them onto ramps in  which load cells are embedded. This eliminates the problems  associated with jacking the aircraft off the ground. However,  many aircraft are weighed by jacking the aircraft up and then  lowering them onto scales or load cells.  

Extra care must be used when raising an aircraft on jacks for  weighing. If the aircraft has spring steel landing gear and it  is jacked at the wheel, the landing gear will slide inward as  the weight is taken off of the tire, and care must be taken to  prevent the jack from tipping over.  

For some aircraft, stress panels or plates must be installed before  the aircraft is raised with wing jacks to distribute the weight  over the jack pad. Be sure to follow the recommendations  of the aircraft manufacturer in detail anytime an aircraft is  jacked. When using two wing jacks, take special care to raise  them simultaneously, keeping the aircraft so it does not slip  off the jacks. As the jacks are raised, keep the safety collars  screwed down against the jack cylinder to prevent the aircraft  from tilting if one of the jacks should lose hydraulic pressure.  

# Leveling the Aircraft  

When an aircraft is weighed, it must be in its level fligh   attitude so that all of the components are at their correct  distance from the datum. This attitude is determined by  information in the TCDS. Some aircraft require a plumb line  to be dropped from a specified location so that the point of the  weight (the bob) hangs directly above an identifiable point.  Others specify that a spirit level be placed across two leveling  lugs, often special screws on the outside of the fuselage. Other  aircraft call for a spirit level to be placed on the upper door sill.  

Lateral level is not specified for all light aircraft, but  provisions are normally made on helicopters for determining  both longitudinal and lateral level. This may be done by  built-in leveling indicators, or by a plumb bob that shows the  The actual adjustments to level the aircraft using load cells  are made with the jacks. When weighing from the wheels,  leveling is normally done by adjusting the air pressure in the  nosewheel shock strut.  

# Safety Considerations  

Special precautions must be taken when raising an aircraft  on jacks.  

1.	 Stress plates must be installed under the jack pads if  the manufacturer specifies them 2.	 If anyone is required to be in the aircraft while it is  being jacked, there must be no movement. 3.	 The jacks must be straight under the jack pads before  beginning to raise the aircraft. 4.	 All jacks must be raised simultaneously and the safety  devices are against the jack cylinder to prevent the  aircraft tipping if any jack should lose pressure. Not  all jacks have screw down collars, some use drop pins  or friction locks.  

# Determining the CG  

When the aircraft is in its level flight attitude, drop a plumb  line from the datum and make a mark on the hangar floor below the tip of the bob. Draw a chalk line through this point  parallel to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  

Then, draw lateral lines between the actual weighing  points for the main wheels, and make a mark along the  longitudinal line at the weighing point for the nosewheel  or the tailwheel. These lines and marks on the floor allow  accurate measurements between the datum and the weighting  points to determine their arms.  

Determine the CG by adding the weight and moment of  each weighing point to determine the total weight and total  moment. Then, divide the total moment by the total weight  to determine the CG relative to the datum. As an example of  locating the CG with respect to the datum, which in this case  is the firewall, consider the tricycle landing gear airplane as  detailed in the  Figure 3-5  table and illustrated in  Figure 3-6.  

When the airplane is on the scales with the parking brakes  

![Figure 3-5.  Locating the CG of an airplane relative to the datum. ](images/889d89bb57aba5d21e7c10407aeb62069c04936103e63f8ed60de333f4cea868.jpg)

off, place chocks around the wheels to keep the airplane  from rolling. Subtract the weight of the chocks, called tare  weight, from the scale reading to determine the net weight  at each weighing point. Multiply each net weight by its arm  to determine its moment, and then determine the total weight  and total moment. The CG is determined by dividing the total

moment by the total weight.  [Figure 3-7] The airplane illustrated in  Figures 3-5  and  3-6  has a net  weight of 2,006 pounds, and its CG is 32.8 inches behind  the datum.  

# EWCG Formulas  

A chart such as the one in  Figure 3-5  helps the pilot visualize  the weights, arms, and moments when solving an EWCG  problem, but it is quicker to determine the EWCG by using  formulas and an electronic calculator. The use of a calculator  for solving these problems is described in Chapter 8, Use of  Computers in Weight and Balance Computations.  

There are four possible conditions and their formulas that  relate the location of CG to the datum. Notice that the  formula for each condition first determines the moment of  the nosewheel or tailwheel and then divides it by the total  weight of the airplane. The arm thus determined is then added  to or subtracted from the distance between the main wheels  and the datum, distance D.  

# Datum Forward of the Airplane—Nosewheel  Landing Gear  

The datum of the airplane in  Figure 3-8  is 100 inches forward  of the leading edge of the wing root or 128 inches forward  

![](images/07adebcd63e6209a759407d90eca36baaf3cb32cf7e82ce304f07b1a73baf76d.jpg)

of the main-wheel weighing points. This is distance (D). The  weight of the nosewheel (F) is 340 pounds, and the distance  between main wheels and nosewheel (L) is 78 inches. The  total weight of the airplane (W) is 2,006 pounds. Determine

the CG by using the formula in  Figure 3-9 . The CG is 114.8 inches aft of the datum. This is 13.2 inches  forward of the main-wheel weighing points, which proves  the location of the datum has no effect on the location of the  CG if all measurements are made from the same location.  

# Datum Aft of the Main Wheels—Nosewheel  Landing Gear  

The datum of some aircraft may be located aft of the main  wheels. The airplane in this example is the same one just  discussed, but the datum is at the intersection of the trailing  edge of the wing with the fuselage. The distance (D) between  the datum of the airplane in  Figure 3-10  and the main-wheel  

![](images/4144536bc197ed25579a614e83dcbad54a69aa0fc603fb8d21e3a671d2f4fe78.jpg)

weighing points is 75 inches, the weight of the nosewheel  (F) is 340 pounds, and the distance between main wheels  and nosewheel (L) is 78 inches. The total net weight of the  airplane (W) is 2,006 pounds.  

The location of the CG may be determined by using the

formula in  Figure 3-11 .  

The CG location is a negative value, which means it is 88.2  inches forward of the datum. This places it 13.2 inches  forward of the main wheels, exactly the same location as  when it was measured from other datum locations.  

# Location of Datum  

The location of the datum is not important, but all  measurements must be made from the same location.  

# Datum Forward of the Main Wheels—Tailwheel  Landing Gear  

Locating the CG of a tailwheel airplane is done in the same  way as locating it for a nosewheel airplane except the formula   $\binom{\mathrm{R}\times\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{W}}$  

The distance (D) between the datum of the airplane in  Figure 3-12  and the main-gear weighing points is 7.5 inches,  the weight of the tailwheel (R) is 67 pounds, and the distance  (L) between the main-wheel and the tailwheel weighing points  is 222 inches. The total weight of the airplane (W) is 1,218  pounds. Determine the CG by using the formula in  Figure 3-13 .

The  net weight of the tailwheel (R) is 67 pounds, the distance  between the main wheels and the tailwheel (L) is 222 inches,  and the total net weight (W) of the airplane is 1,218 pounds.

# Center of Gravity (CG) and Mean  Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)  

# Center of Gravity (CG)  

In addition to overloading or drastically reducing the  aircraft’s weight, the distribution of weight is also a concern.  When aircraft equipment is changed, the person making the  equipment change must make an entry on the equipment list  indicating items added, removed, or relocated; the date of  the change; and the person’s name and certification number  in the aircraft’s maintenance records.  

For the purpose of weight and balance computations, the CG  of an airplane is an imaginary point about which the nose- heavy  $(-)$   moments and tail-heavy  $(+)$   moments are exactly  equal in magnitude. If suspended from the CG point, the  aircraft would have no tendency to rotate nose up or nose  down. The CG of the loaded aircraft can range fore and aft  within certain limits that are determined during the fl ght test  for type certific tion. These limits are the most forward- and  rearward-loaded CG positions at which the aircraft meets the  performance and flight characteristics required by the FAA.  

Any loading that places the CG outside the limits for a  particular aircraft seriously impairs the pilot’s ability to  control the aircraft. For example, it is more difficult to take  off and gain altitude in a nose-heavy aircraft, and the aircraft  tends to drop its nose when the pilot reduces throttle. It also  requires a higher speed to land safely. A tail-heavy aircraft is  more susceptible to stalling at low speed, which is a concern  during the landing approach.  

On small airplanes and on all helicopters, the CG location  is identified as being a specific number of inches from the  datum. The CG range is identifiedin the same way. On larger  airplanes, from private business jets to large jumbo jets, the  CG and its range are typically identified in relation to the  width of the wing.  

# Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)  

The width of the wing, or straight-line distance from the  leading edge to the trailing edge, on an airplane is known as  the chord. If the leading edge and the trailing edge of a wing  are parallel, the chord is equal at all points along the entire  length of the wing. The average length of the chord, or MAC,  of a tapered wing is more complicated to define. The MAC,  as seen in  Figure 3-16 , is the chord of an imaginary airfoil  that has the same aerodynamic characteristics as the actual  airfoil. You can also think of it as the chord drawn through  the geographic center of the plan area of the wing.  

![](images/41d60eb0a2a035e493a5b8b578cebbdb17793ff6c2644988ae3beba92c741e93.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.  The MAC is the chord drawn through the geographic  center of the plan area of the wing.  

weight and balance computations, the MAC is established  by the manufacturer, defining its leading edge (LEMAC)  and trailing edge (TEMAC) in terms of inches from the  datum.  [Figure 3-16]  The CG location and various limits  are then expressed in percentage of the chord or percent  MAC. In order to relate the percent MAC to the datum, all  weight and balance information includes two items: the MAC  length in inches and the location of the LEMAC in inches  from the datum. For the purpose of simplicity, most light- aircraft manufacturers express the CG range in inches from  the datum; transport-category aircraft CGs are expressed in  percent MAC.  

The relative positions of the CG and the aerodynamic  center of lift of the wing have critical effects on the flight characteristics of the aircraft. Consequently, relating the  CG location to the chord of the wing is convenient from  a design and operations standpoint. Normally, an aircraft  has acceptable fl ght characteristics if the CG is located  somewhere near the 25 percent average chord point. This  means the CG is located one-fourth of the distance back from  the LEMAC to the TEMAC. Such a location places the CG  forward of the aerodynamic center for most airfoils.  

The weight and balance data of the airplane in  Figure 3-17  states  that the MAC is from stations 144 to 206 and the CG is  located at station 161.

Determine the location of the CG in inches from the datum  by using the formula found in  Figure 3-19 . The CG of this airplane is located at station 160.9 inches aft  of the datum. It is important for longitudinal stability that the  CG be located ahead of the center of lift of a wing. Since the  center of lift is expressed as percent MAC, the location of  the CG is expressed in the same terms.

# Light Sport Aircraft Weight  and Balance Control  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses the weight and balance procedures  for light sport aircraft (LSA) that differ from conventional  aircraft, specifically weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft  (also called trikes), powered parachutes, and amateur-built  LSA.  [Figure 4-1]  

![](images/b18fb8632a5f095293516a5ad02f862a2bc87295b4aacde3571e967dc99b802b.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.  Examples of light sport aircraft (from top left, clockwise): weight-shift control, powered parachute, glider, airplanes, hot  air balloon, and amateur-built LSA.  

# LSA Definition of Term  

LSA is a category of simple, very basic, small, light-weight,  low-performance aircraft, other than a helicopter or powered- lift, and a classification of aircraft specific to the United  States. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines LSA as an aircraft with a maximum gross takeoff weight of  not more than 1,320 pounds   $(600\,\mathrm{kg})$   for aircraft not intended  for operation over water, or 1,430 pounds   $(650\,\mathrm{kg})$   for aircraft  intended for operation over water; a maximum airspeed in  level  fl ight of 120 knots (220 kilometers per hour   $\mathrm{(km/h)}$  ; 140  miles per hour (mph)); a maximum stall speed of 45 knots  (  $[83\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}$  ; 52 mph); a maximum seating capacity of no more  than two persons (including the pilot); fixed undercarriage  and fixed-pitch or ground-adjustable propeller; and a single  reciprocating engine (if powered).  

An aircraft that qualifies as LSA may be operated by the  holder of a sport pilot certificate, whether registered as LSA  or not. Pilots with a private, recreational, or higher pilot  certificatemay also flyLSA, even if their medical certificate   have expired, as long as they have a valid driver’s license to  prove that they are in good enough health to fly. LSA also  have less restrictive maintenance requirements and may be  maintained and inspected by traditionally certificated aircraft  maintenance technicians (AMTs) or by individuals holding  a Repairman: Light Sport certificate, and (in some cases) by  their pilots and/or owners.  

# Weight and Balance  

Aircraft such as balloons, powered parachutes, and WSC do  not require weight and balance computations because the load  is suspended below the lifting mechanism. The CG range in  these types of aircraft is such that it is difficult to exceed CG  limits. For example, the rear seat position and fuel of a WSC  aircraft are as close as possible to the hang point with the  aircraft in a suspended attitude. Thus, load variations have  little effect on the CG. This also holds true for lighter-than- air aircraft, such as a balloon basket or gondola. While it is  difficult to exceed CG limits in these aircraft, pilots should  never overload an aircraft, as doing so may cause structural  damage and/or failures.  

Weight affects performance; therefore, pilots should calculate  weight and remain within the manufacturer’s established  limits at all times.  

# WSC Aircraft  

WSC aircraft are one- and two-place aircraft that exceed the  criteria of an ultra-light vehicle but do meet the criteria of an  LSA. The definitionfor WSC can be found in 14 CFR part 1.  A WSC aircraft used for sport and private pilot flying must  be registered with an FAA N-number, have an airworthiness  certificate, a pilot’s operating handbook (POH), and/or  limitations with a weight and loading document aboard.  

As mentioned earlier, WSC aircraft are commonly called  trikes. These aircraft have few options for loading because  they lack places to put useful load items. One-place trikes  have only one seat and a fuel tank, which means the only  variables for a flight are amount of fuel and weight of the  pilot. Two-place trikes can accommodate a pilot and a  passenger. This version may have a small storage bin in  addition to the fuel tank.  

The most significant factor affecting the weight and balance  of a trike is the weight of the pilot and, if the aircraft has two  seats, the weight of the passenger. The trike acts somewhat  like a single, main-rotor helicopter because the weight of the  aircraft hangs like a pendulum under the wing.  Figure 4-2   shows a two-place trike, in which the mast and the nose strut  come together slightly below the wing attach point. When  the trike is in flight, the weight of the aircraft hangs from  the wing attach point. The weight of the engine and fuel is  behind this point, the passenger is almost directly below this  point, and the pilot is forward of this point. The balance of  the aircraft is determined by how all these weights compare.  The wing attach point, with respect to the wing keel, is an  adjustable location. The attach point is moved slightly forward  or slightly aft, depending on the weight of the occupants. For  

![](images/0ee9d2b8b9b95bbe4f97d785dc05139c093dea29ae3611ff557b3420b207d88c.jpg)  

example, if the aircraft is flownby a heavy person, the attach  point can be moved farther aft, bringing the wing forward to  compensate for the change in CG.  Figure 4-3  shows a close- up of the wing attach point and the small amount of forward  and aft movement that is available.  

![](images/cf2d5b6d3b043ff82007d53d47d509df2cce54eb320651bbcb3788f863d5c0ca.jpg)  
Figure 4-3.  Wing attach point.  

Similar to airplanes, sailplanes, and powered parachutes,  increasing weight creates increases in speed and descent  rate. However, the WSC aircraft has a unique characteristic.  Adding weight to a WSC aircraft creates more twist in the  wing because the outboard leading edges flex more. With  less lift at the tips, a nose-up effect is created and the trim  speed lowers. Therefore, adding weight can increase speed  similar to other aircraft, but reduce the trim speed because  of the increased twist unique to the WSC aircraft. Each  manufacturer’s make/model has different effects depending  on the specific design. For detailed weight and balance  information, characteristics, and operating limitations, always  reference the specific manufacturer’s manual or POH for the  make and model.  Figure 4-4  shows an example of a weight  and loading sheet that would be issued with a WSC aircraft.  Every aircraft has its own weight and loading data that should  come from the manufacturer. The example in  Figure 4-4 comes from Airborne, an Australian company, named  Airborne XT WSC aircraft. For additional information,  refer to the Weight-Shift Control Aircraft Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-5).  

forward to prevent the aircraft from being too nose heavy.  Figure 4-5  illustrates the structure of a powered parachute  and the location of the wing attachment.  

A powered parachute used for sport and private flying must  be registered with an FAA N-number, have an airworthiness  certificate, a POH, and/or limitations with a weight and  balance document aboard. The aircraft must be maintained  properly by the aircraft owner, or other qualified personnel,  and have the aircraft logbooks available for inspection.  Always refer to the POH for weight and balance information  specifi  to the powered parachute being fl wn. For additional  information, refer to the Powered Parachute Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-29).  

# Weight and Balance Computations  (Amateur-Built Aircraft)  

A good weight and balance calculation is the keystone  of flight testing an amateur-built aircraft. Accurately  determining the aircraft’s takeoff weight and ensuring that  the CG is within the aircraft’s design for each flightis critical  to conducting a safe flight test  

The aircraft should be level when weighed, spanwise and  fore and aft in accordance with the kit manufacturer’s  instructions, and should be in the level flight position. It  is highly recommended that the aircraft be weighed in an  enclosed area using three calibrated scales. Bathroom scales  are not recommended because they are not always accurate.  

# Powered Parachutes  

Powered parachutes have many of the same characteristics  as WSC aircraft when it comes to weight and balance. They  have the same limited loading, with only one or two seats, and  a fuel tank. A powered parachute acts like a pendulum with  the weight of the aircraft hanging beneath the inflated wing  (parachute). The point at which the inflated wing attaches  to the structure of the aircraft is adjustable to compensate  for pilots and passengers of varying weights. With a  very heavy pilot, the wing attach point would be moved  Make and (trike) base model    Airborne XT series/X series aircraft Applicable wing models            Airborne streak 3/Streak 2B/Cruze/Wizard wing

The effect of changing the hang position is to change the trim speed of the aircraft. Moving the hang point forward  increases trim speed (shorter distances to the datum). The hang point position range may be used on the  applicable wings for the entire weight range of the aircraft. CG limits on the trike base/gondola section of the  aircraft limits are not critical. The defined hang point position and its limits are defined in this document.

# Single-Engine Aircraft Weight  and Balance Computations  

# Introduction  

Weight and balance data allows the pilot to determine the  loaded weight of the aircraft and determine whether or not  the loaded center of gravity (CG) is within the allowable  range for the weight. See  Figure 5-1  for an example of the  data necessary for these calculations.  

![](images/4652e295b9e73b04ec119e1878101685a043e762f212af886b875a0e833453c2.jpg)  

![](images/344de2970d2898489b6802c521909e7b9c33686b4cd313530f48ca7c1e3ace39.jpg)  

# Determining the Loaded Weight and CG  

An important part of preflight planning is determining that  the aircraft is loaded so its weight and CG location are within  the allowable limits. The methods of accomplishing this are  the manual computational method using weights, arms, and  moments; the chart method using weight and moment indexes  [Figure 5-2];  and the loading graph method, which eliminates  the need for some mathematical calculations .  

# Manual Computational Method  

The manual computational method uses weights, arms, and  moments. It relates the total weight and CG location to a CG  limits chart similar to those included in the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) and the Pilot’s Operating Handbook/ Aircraft Flight Manual (POH/AFM).  

A worksheet, such as the one shown in  Figure 5-3,  provides  a means to record and compute pertinent weights, arms, and  

![](images/8519f5dece7c7af45c6c3721813c0f9c867303124d70db1c4cb1b5fd35876a3a.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.  Airplane loading diagram.  

moments for all onboard fuel, personnel, equipment, cargo,  and baggage that is not included in the aircraft’s basic empty  weight (BEW).  Figure 5-4  is a sample of a typical equipment  list where many of the pertinent weights and moment values  can be found.  

As part of preflight planning, fill in the blanks in the  worksheet with the specificdata for the flight.The following  weights were used to complete the sample weight and balance  worksheet in  Figure 5-3 .  

Pilot.................................................................120 lb Front seat passenger........................................180 lb Rear seat passenger.........................................175 lb Fuel (88 gal)....................................................528 lb Baggage A.......................................................100 lb Baggage B.........................................................50 lb  

Multiply each item’s weight by its arm to determine the  moment. Then, determine the total weight and the sum of  the moments. Divide the total moment by the total weight to  determine the CG in inches from the datum. For this example,  the total weight is 3,027 pounds and the CG is 43.54 inches  aft of the datum (a negative result would have indicated a  CG forward of the datum).  

To determine whether or not the airplane is properly loaded  for this flight, use the CG limits chart.  [Figure 5-5]  Draw a  line vertically upward from the CG of 43.54 inches and one  horizontally to the right from the loaded weight of 3,027  pounds. These lines cross inside the envelope, which shows  the airplane is properly loaded for takeoff, but 77 pounds  overweight for landing. Note that for this sample chart, the  envelope is defined by the solid black line that indicates  CG limits at or below the maximum weight for takeoff  and landing. There is an additional region identified by a  segmented black line that includes weights suitable only for  takeoff. It is important to note these subtle differences as they  may or may not be found in every POH/AFM.  

![Figure 5-3.  Loading schedule chart derived from loading problem. ](images/90bf1b1925ae03eb6b9e23b640e04200ded027bff2dc1c72b728e88e470ae654.jpg)

Figure 5-5.  CG limits chart from a typical POH.  

# Loading Graph Method  

The charts and graphs found in the POH/AFM can help  simplify and expedite the preflight weight and balance  computation process. Some use a loading graph and moment  indexes rather than the arms and moments. These charts  eliminate the need for calculating moments and make  computations quicker and easier.  [Figure 5-6]  

# Moment Indexes  

Moments determined by multiplying the weight of each  component by its arm result in large numbers that are awkward  to calculate and can become a source of mathematical error.  To eliminate these large numbers, moment indexes are  sometimes used. The moment is divided by a reduction  factor, such as 100 or 1,000, to get the moment index. The  loading graph provides the moment index for each component  to avoid mathematical calculations. The CG envelope uses  moment indexes rather than arms and moments.  

The CG limits envelope is the enclosed area on a graph of  the airplane loaded weight and the CG location. If lines  drawn from the weight and CG cross within this envelope,  the airplane is properly loaded.  

# Loading Graph  

Figure 5-6  is a typical loading graph taken from the POH  of a modern four-place airplane. It is a graph of load weight  and load moment indexes. Diagonal lines for each item  relate the weight to the moment index without having to use  mathematical calculations.  

# Compute Weight and Balance Using the Loading  Graph  

To compute the weight and balance using the loading graph  in  Figure 5-6 , make a loading schedule chart like the one  in  Figure 5-7 . In  Figure 5-6 , follow the horizontal line for  300 pounds load weight to the right until it intersects the  diagonal line for pilot and front passenger. From this point,  drop a line vertically to the load moment index along the  bottom to determine the load moment for the front seat  occupants. This is 11.1 lb‑in divided by 1,000. Record it in  the loading schedule chart. Determine the load moment for  the 175 pounds of rear seat occupants along the diagonal for  second row passengers or cargo. This is 12.9; record it in the  loading schedule chart.  

Determine the load moment for the fuel and the baggage  in areas A and B in the same way and enter them all in the  loading schedule chart. The maximum fuel is marked on  the diagonal line for fuel in terms of gallons or liters. The  maximum is 88 gallons of usable fuel. The total capacity is 92  gallons, but in our example, 4 gallons are unusable and have  already been included in the empty weight of the aircraft. The  weight of 88 gallons of fuel is 528 pounds and its moment  index is 24.6. The 100 pounds of baggage in area A has a  moment index of 9.7 and the 50 pounds in area B has an  index of 5.8. Enter all of these weights and moment indexes  in the loading schedule chart and add all of the weights and  moment indexes to determine the totals.  

Transfer totals to the CG moment envelope in  Figure 5-8 .  The CG moment envelope is an enclosed area on a graph  of the airplane loaded weight and loaded moment. If lines  drawn from the weight and loaded moment cross within  this envelope, the airplane is properly loaded. The loading  schedule from the example in  Figure 5-7  shows that the total  weight of the loaded aircraft is 3,027 pounds, and the loaded  airplane moment divided by 1,000 is 131.8.  

![](images/26bb4cfa9c174b029348817232345536f25768fc3e257fccb95916fda94b1b72.jpg)  
Note:  Line representing adjustable seats shows pilot and front seat passenger CG on adjustable seat positioned for an    average occupant. Refer to the Loading Arrangements diagram for forward and aft limits of occupant CG range.  

![Figure 5-7.  Loading schedule chart. ](images/dd59d9c54cdc971a63fb8cc4ce0d652a1d21d428233f3cc88672ca747d7f55f7.jpg)

Figure 5-8.  CG moment envelope.  

Referring to  Figure 5-8 , draw a line vertically upward from  131.8 on the horizontal index at the bottom of the chart and  a horizontal line from 3,027 pounds in the left-vertical index.  These lines intersect within the dashed area, which shows  that the aircraft is loaded properly for takeoff, but it is too  heavy for landing (similar to the previous example). Because  of this, if the aircraft had to return for landing immediately  after takeoff, it would need to fly long enough to burn 77  pounds (slightly less than 13 gallons) of fuel to reduce its  weight for landing.  

# Multiengine Aircraft  Weight and Balance  Computations  

# Introduction  

Weight and balance computations for small multiengine  airplanes are similar to those discussed for single-engine  airplanes. See  Figure 6-1  for an example of weight and  balance data for a typical light twin-engine airplane.  

![](images/02bab488b7149622bfc1b90a40080945b1790a18ff993e248a8671d44b3465eb.jpg)

Weight with fuel drained and oil full:  

Right wheel scales.........................1,084 lb, tare 8 lb Left wheel scales...........................1,148 lb, tare 8 lb Nose wheel scales. .......................1,202 lb, tare 14 lb  

# Determine the Loaded CG  

First, add the weights indicated by the individual scales and  then subtract the tare weights to determine the BEW. Next,  using the BEW and EWCG, the loaded weight and CG of the  aircraft can be determined with data from  Figure 6-2,  using  a chart such as the one in  Figure 6-3 .  

The aircraft is loaded as shown: Fuel (140 gal)................................................. 840 lb Front seats...................................................... 320 lb Row 2 seats. .................................................... 310 lb Forward baggage............................................ 100 lb Aft baggage...................................................... 90 lb  

# Chart Method Using Weight, Arm, and Moments  

The airplane in this example was weighed to determine its  basic empty weight (BEW) and empty weight center of  gravity (EWCG). The weighing conditions and results are:

The loaded weight for this fl ght is 5,064 pounds, and the CG  is located at 42.47 inches aft of the datum.  

To determine that the weight and CG are within the allowable  range, refer to the CG range chart in  Figure 6-4 . Draw a line  vertically upward from 42.47 inches from the datum and one  horizontally from 5,064 pounds. These lines cross inside the  envelope, showing that the airplane is properly loaded.

# Determining the CG in Percentage of Mean  Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)  

Refer again to  Figures 6-2  and  6-3 .  

The loaded CG is 42.47 inches aft of the datum. The MAC is 61.6 inches long. The LEMAC is located at station 20.1. The CG is  $42.47-20.1=22.37\$   inches aft of LEMAC.  

Use the formula in  Figure 6-5  to findthe CG in percent MAC.

# The Chart Method Using Weight and Moment  Indexes  

As mentioned in the previous chapter, anything that can be  done to make careful preflight planning easier makes flying safer. Many manufacturers furnish charts in the Pilot’s  Operating Handbook/Aircraft Flight Manual (POH/AFM)  that use weight and moment indexes rather than weight, arm,  and moments. The charts also help reduce errors by including  tables of moment indexes for the various weights.  

Consider the loading for this particular flight Cruise fuel flow  $=16$   gallons per hou Estimated time en route  $=2$   hours, 10 minutes Reserve fuel  $=45$   minutes  $=12$   gallons Total required fuel  $=47$   gallons  

The pilot completes a chart like the one in  Figure 6-6  using  moment indexes from tables in  Figures   $^{6-7}$   and   $_{6-8}$  .  

The moments divided by 100 in the index column are found  in the charts in  Figures 6-7  through  $_{6-9,}$  . If the exact weight  is not in the chart, interpolate between the weights that are  included. When a weight is greater than any of those shown  in the charts, add the moment indexes for a combination of  weights to get that which is desired. For example, to get the  moments divided by 100 for the 320 pounds in the front seats,  add the moment index for 100 pounds (105) to that for 220  pounds (231). This gives the moment index of 336 for 320  pounds in the front seats.  

Use the moment limits versus weight envelope in  Figure 6-10   to determine if the weight and balance conditions are  within allowable limits for both takeoff and landing at the  destination. The moment limits versus weight envelope is an  enclosed area on a graph of three parameters. The diagonal  line representing the moment divided by 100 crosses the  horizontal line representing the weight at the vertical line  representing the CG location in inches aft of the datum. When  the lines cross inside the envelope, the aircraft is loaded  within its weight and CG limits.  

Takeoff: – 3,781 lb and 4,296 moment divided by 100 Landing: – 3,571 lb and 4,050 moment divided by 100 The loaded CG is located at 36.3 percent MAC.  

![](images/987c29ab45f9f65b26a0c3cd90af3c456e400a750542ba74d130e0bdf7b35072.jpg)  

![Figure 6-7.  Sample weight and moment index for occupants. ](images/ca3ce091b57a586857ecc340e0f124e1ed962c29c4757189a13aa26dd7f93cae.jpg)  

Locate the moment divided by 100 diagonal line for 4,296 and  follow it down until it crosses the horizontal line for 3,781  pounds. These lines cross inside the envelope at the vertical  line for a CG location of 114 (113.6) inches aft of the datum.  

The maximum allowable takeoff weight is 3,900 pounds, and  this airplane weighs 3,781 pounds. The CG limits for 3,781  pounds are 109.8 to 117.5. The CG of 114 (113.6) inches  falls within these allowable limits.

# Center of Gravity Change After  a Repair or Alteration  

# Introduction  

The largest weight changes that occur during the lifetime of  an aircraft are those caused by alterations and repairs. It is the  responsibility of the FAA-certificated mechanic or repairman  doing the work to accurately document the weight change  and record it in both the maintenance records and the Pilot’s  Operating Handbook/Aircraft Flight Manual (POH/AFM).  

![](images/cfe6d0e29f0031f6398245383feeea5a0f5c59672ed30a39ee47b6c488d24636.jpg)  

# Equipment List  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers  the addition or removal of equipment included in the  Comprehensive Equipment List to be a minor alteration.  The weights and arms are included with the items in the  equipment list, and these minor alterations can be done and the  aircraft approved for return to service by an FAA-certificate   mechanic or repairman. The only documentation required is an  entry in the aircraft maintenance records and the appropriate  change to the weight and balance record in the POH/AFM.  [Figure 7-1]  

Figure 7-2  is a   comprehensive   list of all Cessna equipment  that is available for the Model 182S airplane. It should  not be confused with the airplane-specific equipment list.  An airplane-s pecifi c list is provided with each individual  airplane at delivery and is typically found at the end of the  Pilot’s Operating Handbook. The following comprehensive  equipment list and the airplane-specific list have a similar  order of listing.  

The comprehensive equipment list provides the following  information in column form:  

In the Item No column, each item is assigned a coded number.  The first two digits of the code represent the assignment  of an equipment item within the ATA Specification 100  breakdown (Chapter 11 for Placards, Chapter 21 for Air  Conditioning, Chapter 77 for Engine Indicating, etc.). These  assignments also correspond to the Maintenance Manual  chapter breakdown for the airplane. Items receive a unique  sequence number (01, 02, 03, etc.). After the sequence  number (and hyphen), a suffix letter is assigned to identify  an equipment item as required, standard, or optional. Suffix letters are as follows:  

$-\mathbf{R}=$   required item or equipment for FAA certificatio  $-\mathbf{S}=$  standard equipment item  $-\mathbf{O}=$  optional equipment item replacing required or 	 	 standard item(s)  $-\mathbf{A}=$  optional equipment item that is in addition to 		 	 required or standard items  

In the Equipment List Description column, each item is  assigned a descriptive name to help identify its function.  

In the Ref Drawing column, a drawing number is provided  that corresponds to the item.  

Note: Additional equipment must be installed in accordance  with the reference drawing, service bulletin, or a separate  FAA approval.  

In the Wt and Arm columns, you find the weight in pounds  and arm in inches of the equipment item.  

Notes: Unless otherwise indicated, true values (not net  change values) for the weight and arm are shown. Positive  arms are distances aft of the airplane datum; negative  arms are distances forward of the datum. Asterisks   $(^{*})$   in  the weight and arm column indicate complete assembly  installations. Some major components of the assembly are  listed on the lines immediately following. The sum of these  major components does not necessarily equal the complete  assembly installation.

# Major Alteration and Repair  

Within the following text, information concerning major  repairs or major alterations does not apply to any aircraft  within the light-sport category. This category of aircraft is  not eligible for major repairs or alterations.  

Any major alteration or repair requires the work to be done  by an FAA-certificated mechanic or repairman or facility.  The work must be checked for conformity to FAA-approved  data and signed off by an aircraft mechanic holding an  Inspection Authorization (IA) or by an authorized agent of  an appropriately rated FAA-approved repair station. A Repair  Station record and/or FAA form 337, Major Repair and  Alteration, must be completed describing the work. (Reference  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 43,  appendix B, for the recording of major repair and alterations  requirements.) A dated and signed revision to the weight and  balance record is made and kept with the maintenance records,  and the airplane’s new empty weight and empty weight arm  or moment index are entered in the POH/AFM.  

# Weight and Balance Revision Record  

Aircraft manufacturers use different formats for their weight  and balance data, but  Figure 7-3  is typical of a weight and  balance revision record. All weight and balance records  should be kept with the other aircraft records. Each revision  record should be identified by the date, the aircraft make,  model, and serial number. The pages should be signed by  the person making the revision and his or her certificatetype  and number must be included.  

The computations for a weight and balance revision  are included on a weight and balance revision form.  Appropriate fore-and-aft extreme loading conditions should  be investigated and the computations shown. The date those  computations were made is shown in the upper right corner  of  Figure 7-3 . When this work is superseded, a notation  must be made on the new weight and balance revision form,  including a statement that the new computations supersede  the computations dated “MM/DD/YY.”

The weight and balance revision sheet should clearly show  the revised empty weight, empty weight arm and/or moment  index, and the new useful load. An example of these entries  can be found at the bottom of  Figure 7-3 .  

# Weight Changes Caused by a Repair or  Alteration  

A typical alteration might consist of removing two pieces  of radio equipment from the instrument panel and a power  supply that was located in the baggage compartment behind  the rear seat. In this example, these two pieces are replaced  with a single lightweight, self-contained radio. At the  same time, an old emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is  removed from its mount near the tail, and a lighter weight  unit is installed. A passenger seat is installed in the baggage  compartment.  

# Computations Using Weight, Arm, and Moment  

The first step in the weight and balance computation is to  make a chart like the one in  Figure 7-4 , listing all of the  items that are involved. The new center of gravity (CG) of  36.4 inches aft of the datum is determined by dividing the  new moment by the new weight.  

# Computations Using Weight and Moment Indexes  

If the weight and balance data uses moment indexes rather  than arms and moments, this same alteration can be computed  using a chart such as the one in  Figure 7-5 . Subtract the  weight and moment indexes of all the removed equipment  from the empty weight and moment index of the airplane.  Add the weight and moment indexes of all equipment  installed to determine the total weight and the total moment  index. To determine the position of the new CG in inches  aft of the datum, multiply the total moment index by 100 to  get the moment, and divide this by the total weight to get  the new CG.  

![Figure 7-4.  Weight, arm, and moment changes caused by typical alteration or repair. ](images/3329486203170f98642737cf10ea1ea8f3fd2819f81d2be4c749522848bd58d2.jpg)

# Determining the CG in Percentage of Mean  Aerodynamic Chord (Percent MAC)  

This procedure is the same as found in Chapter 5, Single- Engine Aircraft Weight and Balance Computations.  Refer to the load conditions and CG information found in  Figures 7-5, 7-6,  and  7-7  to compute the CG in percent MAC:  

The loaded CG is  $+36.4$   inches aft of the datum. The MAC is 58.0 inches long.  

The leading edge mean aerodynamic chord (LEMAC)  is located at station 25.98.  

The CG is  $+36.4\!-\!25.98\!=\!10.42$   inches aft of LEMAC.

NOTE 1: The certificated empty weight and corresponding center of gravity location must include unusable fuel of 30 lb  $(+46)$   and  undrainable oil of 0 lb.

The loaded CG after alteration or repair is located at 17.9  percent MAC.  

# Empty Weight CG (EWCG) Range  

The fuel tanks, seats, and baggage compartments of some  aircraft are so located that changes in the fuel or occupant  load have a very limited effect on the balance of the aircraft.  Aircraft of such a configuration show an empty weight CG  (EWCG) range in the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS).  If the EWCG is located within this range, it is impossible to  legally load the aircraft so that its loaded CG falls outside  its allowable range.  

If the TCDS lists an EWCG range, and after the alteration is  completed the EWCG falls within this range, then there is no  need to compute a fore and aft check for adverse loading. But  if the TCDS lists the EWCG range as “None” (and most of  them do), a check must be made to determine whether or not  it is possible by any combination of legal loading to cause the  aircraft CG to move outside of either its forward or aft limits.  

# Adverse-Load CG Checks  

Many modern aircraft have multiple rows of seats and often  more than one baggage compartment. After any repair or  alteration that changes the weight and balance, the Airframe  and Powerplant (A&P) FAA-certificated mechanic or  repairman must ensure that no legal condition of loading can  move the CG outside of its allowable limits. To determine  this, adverse-loaded CG checks must be performed and  the results noted in the weight and balance revision sheet.  [Figure 7-3]  

# Forward Adverse-Load CG Check  

To conduct a forward CG check, make a chart that includes  the airplane and any occupants and items of the load located  in front of the forward CG limit. Include only those items  behind the forward limit that are essential to flight: the pilot,  and the minimum fuel.  

In this example, the pilot, whose nominal weight is 170  pounds, is behind the forward CG limit. The fuel is also  behind the forward limit, so the minimum fuel is used. For  weight and balance purposes, the minimum fuel is no more  than the quantity needed for one-half hour of operation at  rated maximum continuous power. This is considered to  be   $\%_{2}$   gallon for each maximum except takeoff (METO)  horsepower. Because aviation gasoline weighs 6 pounds per  gallon, determine the number of pounds of the minimum fuel  by dividing the METO horsepower by two. In this example,  minimum fuel is 115 pounds. The front and rear seats and the  baggage are all behind the forward CG limit, so no passengers  or baggage are considered.  

Make a chart like the one in  Figure 7-9  to determine the CG  with the aircraft loaded for its most forward CG. With the  load consisting of only a pilot and the minimum fuel, the CG  is   $+36.6$  , which is behind the most forward allowable limit  for this weight of  $+33.0$  .  

# Aft Adverse-Load CG Check  

To conduct an aft or rearward CG check, make a chart that  includes the empty weight and EWCG of the aircraft after  the alteration and all occupants and items of the load behind  the aft CG limit of 46.0. The pilot is in front of this limit but  is essential for flight and must be included. In this example,  only the pilot occupies the front seats. Since the CG of the  fuel is behind the aft limit, full fuel is used, as well as the  nominal weight (170 lb) for both rear seat passengers and  the maximum allowable baggage.  

Under these loading conditions, the CG is located at  $+45.8$  ,  which is ahead of the aft limit of  $+46.0$  .  [Figure 7-10]  With  only the pilot in front of the aft CG limit and maximum of all  items behind the aft limit, the CG is at  $+45.8$   inches, which  is ahead of the aft limit of  $+46.0$   inches.  

# Ballast  

It is possible to load most modern airplanes so the CG  shifts outside of the allowable limit. Placards and loading  instructions in the weight and balance data inform the pilot  of the restrictions that prevent such a shift from occurring.  A typical placard in the baggage compartment of an airplane  is shown in  Figure 7-11 . When the CG of an aircraft falls  outside of the limits, it can usually be brought back in by  using ballast.  

When rear row of seats is occupied, 120 pounds of  baggage or ballast must be carried in forward baggage  compartment. For additional loading instruction,  see Weight and Balance Data.  

![Figure 7-9.  Load conditions for forward adverse-load CG check. ](images/35076d2d5c10f9f42bc92ea5625fc0adf3de75baa44274b3fd518dcc998d09ed.jpg)  

![Figure 7-10.  Load conditions for aft adverse-load CG check. ](images/602e9d40320dbb48345926ab3ed3e0295c905cdc78ec1a59ba3f8e17daf47295.jpg)  

# Temporary Ballast  

Temporary ballast, in the form of lead bars or heavy canvas  bags of sand or lead shot, is often carried in the baggage  compartments to adjust the balance for certain flight  conditions. The bags are marked “Ballast XX Pounds— Removal Requires Weight and Balance Check.” Temporary  ballast must be secured so it cannot shift its location in flight   and the structural limits of the baggage compartment must not  be exceeded. All temporary ballast must be removed before  the aircraft is weighed.  

# Temporary Ballast Formula  

The CG of a loaded airplane can be moved into its allowable  range by shifting passengers or cargo or by adding temporary  ballast.  

# Permanent Ballast  

If a repair or alteration causes the aircraft CG to fall outside  of its limit, permanent ballast can be installed. Usually  permanent ballast is made of blocks of lead painted red and  marked “Permanent Ballast—Do Not Remove.” It should be  attached to the structure so that it does not interfere with any  control action and attached rigidly enough that it cannot be  dislodged by any flight maneuvers or rough landing  

To determine the amount of ballast needed, use the formula  in  Figure 7-13 .  

Figure 7-13.  Formula for determining ballast.  

$$
{\begin{array}{r c l}{\operatorname{Ballast{\bmod{6}}}}&{=}&{{\displaystyle{\frac{1.876\times0.8}{228-33}}}}\\ &{}&\\ &{=}&{{\displaystyle{\frac{1500.8}{195}}}}\\ &{}&\\ &{=}&{{\displaystyle{7.7\operatorname{pounds}}}}\end{array}}
$$  

A block of lead weighing 7.7 pounds, attached to the bulkhead  at fuselage station 228, moves the EWCG back to its proper  forward limit of   $+33$  . This block should be painted red and  marked “Permanent Ballast—Do Not Remove.”  

Two things must first be known to determine the amount of  ballast needed to bring the CG within limits: the amount the  CG is out of limits, and the distance between the location of  the ballast and the limit that is affected.  

If an airplane with an empty weight of 1,876 pounds has been  altered so its EWCG is  $+32.2$  , and CG range for weights up  to 2,250 pounds is  $+33.0$   to  $+46.0$  , permanent ballast must be  installed to move the EWCG from  $+32.2$   to  $+33.0$  . There is  a bulkhead at fuselage station 228 strong enough to support  the ballast.

# Weight and Balance Control— Helicopter  

# Introduction  

Weight and balance considerations of a helicopter are similar  to those of an airplane, except they are far more critical,  and the center of gravity (CG) range is much more limited.  [Figures 8-1  and  8-2]  The engineers who design a helicopter  determine the amount of cyclic control authority that is  available, and establish both the longitudinal and lateral CG  envelopes that allow the pilot to load the helicopter so there  is sufficient cyclic control for all flight conditions  

![](images/9c18d8e42c90f63b7d4cff6360a8427afb0918c3f0c478b48cc97b0bf8681867.jpg)  

![Figure 8-1.  Weight and balance data needed to determine proper  loading of a helicopter. ](images/14c0590ddbdad3558fb76edf98ee775349d51bae1d6376e95d4145c51c4efa18.jpg)

Figure 8-2.  Typical helicopter datum, flight stations, and butt line  locations.  

If the CG is ahead of the forward limit, the helicopter tilts  and the rotor disk has a forward pull. To counteract this  and maintain a stationary position, rearward cyclic stick  displacement would be required. If the CG is too far forward,  there may not be enough available cyclic authority to allow  the helicopter to flare during landing, and it consequently  requires an excessive landing distance.  

If the CG is aft of the allowable limits, the helicopter flies with a tail-low attitude and may need more forward cyclic  stick displacement than is available to maintain a hover in a  no-wind condition. There might not be enough cyclic travel  to prevent the tail boom from striking the ground. If gusty  winds should cause the helicopter to pitch up during high  speed fl ght, there might not be enough forward cyclic control  to safely lower the nose.  

The fuel tanks on some helicopters are behind the CG,  causing it to shift forward as fuel is used. Under some flight conditions, the balance may shift enough that there is not  sufficient cyclic authority to flare for landing. For these  helicopters, the loaded CG should be computed for both  takeoff and landing weights.  

Lateral balance of an airplane is usually of little concern  and is not normally calculated. Some helicopters, especially  those equipped for hoist operations, are sensitive to the lateral  position of the CG and their Pilot’s Operating Handbook/ Rotorcraft Flight Manual (POH/RFM) include both  longitudinal and lateral CG envelopes, as well as information  on the maximum permissible hoist load. Figure 8-3 is an example of such CG envelopes.  

![](images/245a72f707617b4c835b3695b8239f664d15198872d51e4f40cca67a54e23098.jpg)  
Figure 8-3.  Typical helicopter CG envelopes.  

Helicopters are approved for a specifi  maximum gross  weight, but it is not safe to operate them at this weight under  some conditions. A high density altitude decreases the safe  maximum weight as it affects the hovering, takeoff, climb,  autorotation, and landing performance.  

# Determining the Loaded CG of a  Helicopter  

The empty weight and empty weight center of gravity  (EWCG) of a helicopter are determined in the same way  as for an airplane. See Chapter 5, Single-Engine Aircraft  Weight and Balance Computations. The weights recorded  on the scales supporting the helicopter are added and their  distances from the datum are used to compute the moments  at each weighing point. The total moment is divided by the  total weight to determine the location of the CG in inches  from the datum. The datum of some helicopters is located at  the center of the rotor mast, but since this causes some arms  to be positive (behind the datum) and others negative (ahead  of the datum), most modern helicopters have the datum  located ahead of the aircraft, as do most modern airplanes.  When the datum is ahead of the aircraft, all longitudinal  arms are positive.  

The lateral CG is determined in the same way as the  longitudinal CG, except the distances between the scales and  butt line zero (BL 0) are used as the arms. Arms to the right  of BL 0 are positive and those to the left are negative. The  butt line zero (or sometimes referred to as the buttock) is a  line through the symmetrical center of an aircraft from nose  to tail. It serves as the datum for measuring the arms used to  find the lateral CG. Lateral moments that cause the aircraft  to roll clockwise are positive   $(+)$  , and those that cause it to  roll counterclockwise are negative   $(-)$  .  

To determine whether or not a helicopter is within both  longitudinal and lateral weight and balance limits, construct  a table like the one in  Figure 8-4,  with the following data  specific to the aircraft  

Empty weight	 �������������������������������������	 1,545 lb EWCG	 ������������������������������������������������	 101.4 inches aft of  the datum Lateral balance	 �����������������������������������	arm.  0.2 inches right  of BL 0 Maximum allowable gross weight	 �����	 2,250 lb Pilot	 ����������������������������������������������������	 200 lb   $@$   64 inches  aft of datum and  13.5 inches right of  BL 0 Passenger	�������������������������������������������	 170 lb   $@$   64 inches  aft of datum and  –13.5 in left of BL 0 Fuel (48 gal)	 ���������������������������������������	 288 lb   $@$   96 inches  aft of datum and   $-8.4$   inches left of  BL 0  

Check the helicopter CG envelopes in  Figure 8-3  to determine  whether or not the CG is within limits both longitudinally  and laterally.  

In the longitudinal CG envelope, draw a line vertically  upward from the CG of 94.4 inches aft of datum and a  horizontal line from the weight of 2,203 pounds gross weight.  These lines cross within the approved area.  

In the lateral offset moment envelope, draw a line vertically  upward from the –1,705 lb-in point (on the left side of the  horizontal axis) and a line horizontally from 2,203 pounds on  the gross weight index. These lines cross within the envelope,  showing the lateral balance is also within limits.  

# Effects of Offloading Passengers an   Using Fuel  

Consider the helicopter in  Figure 8-4 . The first leg of the  flight consumes 26 gallons of fuel, and at the end of this leg,  the passenger deplanes. Is the helicopter still within allowable  CG limits for takeoff? To findout, make a new chart like the  one in  Figure 8-5  to show the new loading conditions of the  helicopter at the beginning of the second leg of the flight  

Under these conditions, according to the helicopter CG  envelopes in  Figure 8-3 , both the longitudinal CG and the  lateral offset moment fall outside of the approved area of  the envelope. The aircraft longitudinal CG is too far aft and  the potential for excessive tail-low attitudes is very high.  Under these conditions, it is possible that there will not be  enough forward cyclic authority to maintain level flight   The helicopter’s lateral offset moment is too far right and  may lead to control issues, as well as an increased hazard of  dynamic rollover. One possible option to bring the aircraft  loading conditions within the approved envelope is to load  either ballast or a passenger, as computed in  Figure 8-6  and  plotted in  Figure 8-3 .

# Weight and Balance Control— Commuter Category and  Large Aircraft  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses general guidelines and procedures for  weighing large fixed-wingaircraft exceeding a takeoff weight  of 12,500 pounds. Several examples of center of gravity (CG)  determination for various operational aspects of these aircraft  are also included. Persons seeking approval for a weight and  balance control program for aircraft operated under Title  14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,  subpart K, 121, 125, or 135 should consult with the Flight  Standards District Office(FSDO) or Certificate Management  Office (CMO) that has jurisdiction in their area. Additional  information on weight and balance for large aircraft can be  found in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory  Circular (AC) 120-27, Aircraft Weight and Balance Control,  FAA Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS), and the aircraft  flight and maintenance manuals for specific aircraf  

# Establishing the Initial Weight of an  Aircraft  

Prior to being placed into service, each aircraft is weighed  and the empty weight and CG location established. New  aircraft are normally weighed at the factory and are eligible  to be placed into operation without reweighing if the weight  and balance records were adjusted for alterations and  modificationsto the aircraft, such as interior reconfiguration s  

An aircraft transferred from one operator that has an approved  weight and balance program to another operator with an  approved program does not need to be weighed prior to use by  the receiving operator unless more than 36 calendar months  have elapsed since the last individual or fleet weighing, or  unless some other modification to the aircraft warrants that  the aircraft be weighed. Aircraft transferred, purchased, or  leased from an operator without an approved weight and  balance program, and that have not been modified or have  been minimally modified,can be placed into service without  being reweighed if the last weighing was accomplished by an  acceptable method (for example, manufacturer’s instructions  or AC 43.13-2, Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and  Practices—Aircraft Alterations) within the last 12 calendar  months and a weight and balance change record was  maintained by the operator. It is potentially unsafe to fail to  reweigh an aircraft after it has been modified  

When weighing large aircraft, compliance with the relevant  manuals, operations specifications, or management  specification is required to ensure that weight and balance  requirements specified in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)  are met in accordance with approved limits. This provides  information to the flight crew that allows the maximum  payload to be carried safely.  

The aircraft should be weighed in still air or an enclosed  building after the aircraft has been cleaned. Ensure that the  aircraft is in a configuration for weighing with regard to  flightcontrols, unusable fuel, ballast, oil and other operating  fluids, and equipment as required by the controlling weight  and balance procedure.  

Large aircraft are not usually raised off the floor on jacks  for weighing; they are weighed on ramp-type scales. The  scales must be properly calibrated, zeroed, and used in  accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Each scale  should be periodically checked for accuracy as recommended  in the manufacturer’s calibration schedule, either by the  manufacturer or by a recognized facility, such as a civil  department of weights and measures. If no manufacturer’s  schedule is available, the period between calibrations should  not exceed 12 months.  

# Determining the Empty Weight and  Empty Weight CG (EWCG)  

When the aircraft is properly prepared for weighing, roll it  onto the scales, and level it. The weights are measured at  three weighing points: the two main wheel points and the  nosewheel point. The empty weight and empty weight CG  (EWCG) are determined by using the following steps with  the results recorded in the weight and balance record for use  in all future weight and balance computations.  

1.	 Determine the moment index of each of the main- wheel points by multiplying the net weight (scale  reading minus tare weight), in pounds, at these points  by the distance from the datum, in inches. Divide these  numbers by the appropriate reduction factor. 2.	 Determine the moment index of the nosewheel  weighing point by multiplying its net weight, in  pounds, by its distance from the datum, in inches.  Divide this by the reduction factor. 3.	 Determine the total weight by adding the net weight of  the three weighing points and the total moment index  by adding the moment indexes of each point. 4.	 Divide the total moment index by the total weight and  multiply the result by the reduction factor. This gives  the CG in inches from the datum. 5.	 Determine the distance of the CG behind the leading  CG edge of the mean aerodynamic chord (LEMAC)  by subtracting the distance between the datum and  LEMAC from the distance between the datum and  the CG.  [Figure 9-1]

# Documenting Changes to an Aircraft’s  Weight and Balance  

The weight and balance system should include methods by  which a complete, current, and continuous record of the  weight and CG of each aircraft is maintained, such as a log,  ledger, or other equivalent electronic means. Alterations and  changes affecting the weight and/or balance of the aircraft  should be recorded in this log. Changes in the weight or  location of weight in or on the aircraft should be recorded  whenever the weight change is at or exceeds the weights  listed in  Figure 9-3 .  

# Determining the Loaded CG of the  Airplane in Percent MAC  

A loading schedule is used to document compliance with the  certificated weight and balance limitations contained in the  manufacturer’s AFM and weight and balance manual. The  basic operating weight (BOW) and the operating index are  entered into a loading schedule like the one in  Figure 9-4,  and  the variables for a specific flight are entered as appropriate  to determine the loaded weight and CG.  

Figure 9-5  illustrates passenger, cargo, and fuel loading  tables. Using these tables, determine the moment indexes  for the passengers (PAX), cargo, and fuel.  

The airplane is loaded in this way:  

Passengers (nominal weight—170 pounds each) Forward compartment. .................................................18 Aft compartment. ......................................................... 95  

Cargo Forward hold. ......................................................1,500 lb Aft hold. ..............................................................2,500 lb  

Fuel Tanks 1 and 3. ...........................................10,500 lb each Tank 2...............................................................28,000 lb  

The formula in  Figure 9-6  can be used to determine the  location of the CG in inches aft of the datum.  

Use the data in this example:  

Basic operating weight...................................105,500 lb Basic operating index (total moment/1,000).....98,837.0 MAC...................................................................180.9 in LEMAC.................................................................. 860.5  

![Figure 9-4.  Loading schedule. ](images/6e7f6930ac98c6e799ad0a8c2d2fa327848f0fb75a7e4700b6677c50c24b1a79.jpg)

# Operational Empty Weight (OEW)  

Operational empty weight (OEW) is the basic empty weight  or fl et empty weight plus operational items. The operator has  two choices for maintaining OEW. The loading schedule may  be utilized to compute the operational weight and balance of  an individual aircraft, or the operator may choose to establish  fleet empty weights for a fleet or group of aircraf  

# Reestablishing the OEW  

The OEW and CG position of each aircraft should be  reestablished at the reweighing. In addition, it should be  reestablished through calculation whenever the cumulative  change to the weight and balance log is more than plus or  minus one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) of the maximum  landing weight, or whenever the cumulative change in the  CG position exceeds one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) of the  MAC. In the case of rotorcraft and aircraft that do not have a  MAC-based CG envelope (e.g., canard equipped airplane),  whenever the cumulative change in the CG position exceeds  one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) of the total CG range, the  weight and balance should be reestablished.  

When reestablishing the aircraft OEW between reweighing  periods, the weight changes may be computed provided the  weight and CG location of the modifications are known;  otherwise, the aircraft must be reweighed.  

# Fleet Operating Empty Weights (FOEW)  

An operator may choose to use one weight for a fleetor group  of aircraft if the weight and CG of each aircraft is within the  limits stated above for establishment of OEW. When the  cumulative changes to an aircraft weight and balance log  exceed the weight or CG limits for the established fleetweight,  the empty weight for that aircraft should be reestablished.  This may be done by moving the aircraft to another group, or  reestablishing new fleet operating empty weights (FOEWs)  

# Onboard Aircraft Weighing System  

Some large transport airplanes have an onboard aircraft  weighing system (OBAWS) that, when the aircraft is on the  ground, gives the flight crew a continuous indication of the  aircraft total weight and the location of the CG in percent  MAC. Procedures are required to ensure the onboard weight  and balance system equipment is periodically calibrated in  accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.  

An operator may use an onboard weight and balance  system to measure an aircraft’s weight and balance as a  primary means to dispatch an aircraft, provided the FAA  has certified the system and approved the system for use in  an operator’s weight and balance control program. As part  of the approval process, the onboard weight and balance  system must maintain its certificated accuracy. The accuracy  demonstration test is provided in the maintenance manual  portion of the Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) or type  certificate of the onboard weight and balance system.  

The system consists of strain-sensing transducers in each  main wheel and nosewheel axle, a weight and balance  computer, and indicators that show the gross weight, the  CG location in percent MAC, and an indicator of the ground  attitude of the aircraft.  

The strain sensors measure the amount each axle defl cts and  sends this data into the computer, where signals from all of  the transducers and the ground attitude sensor are integrated.  The results are displayed on the indicators for the flightcrew.  Using an onboard weight and balance system does not relieve  an operator from the requirement to complete and maintain  a load manifest.  

# Determining the Correct Stabilizer Trim Setting  

It is important before takeoff to set the stabilizer trim for the  existing CG location. There are two ways the stabilizer trim  setting systems may be calibrated: in percent MAC and in  units airplane nose up (ANU).  

If the stabilizer trim is calibrated in percent MAC, determine  the CG location in percent MAC as has just been described,  then set the stabilizer trim on the percentage figure thus  determined.  Some aircraft give the stabilizer trim setting in  units of ANU that correspond with the location of the CG  in percent MAC. When preparing for takeoff in an aircraft  equipped with this system, first determine the CG in percent  MAC in the way described above, then refer to the stabilizer  trim setting chart on the takeoff performance page of the  pertinent AFM.  Figure 9-9  is an excerpt from the AFM chart  on the takeoff performance of a Boeing 737.  

![](images/e99ead5cc91fe93b7b759c2a8f98f57ed5e7bb3c51a30b154e0c6af0b9eb0079.jpg)  

Consider an airplane with these specifications

Determine the distance from the CG to the LEMAC  by using the formula in  Figure 9-10 . 2.	 Determine the location of the CG in percent MAC by  using the formula found in  Figure 9-11 .  

Refer to  Figure 9-9  for all flap settings and a CG located  at 8 percent MAC; the stabilizer setting is  $7\%$   units ANU.

# Determining CG Changes Caused by  Modifying the Cargo  

Since large aircraft can carry substantial cargo, adding,  subtracting, or moving any of the cargo from one hold to  another can cause large shifts in the CG.  

# Effects of Loading or Offloading Cargo  

Both the weight and CG of an aircraft are changed when  cargo is loaded or offloaded. In the following example, the  new weight and CG are calculated after 2,500 pounds of  cargo is offloaded from the forward cargo hold  

Aircraft specifications are  

Loaded weight..................................................90,000 lb Loaded CG. ........................................ 22.5 percent MAC Weight change....................................................2,500 lb Forward cargo hold centroid. ...................... station 352.1 MAC...................................................................141.5 in LEMAC.................................................... station 549.13 1.	 Determine the CG location in inches from the  datum before the cargo is removed. Do this by first determining the distance of the CG aft of the LEMAC.  [Figure 9-12]  

![](images/8e2001084b615d4c56d7c5c12fc74d10f5456d3bf3f6a2947eca6565e61f28c2.jpg)  
Figure 9-12.  Determining the location of CG in inches before cargo  is removed.  

2.	 Determine the distance between the CG and the datum  by adding the CG in inches aft of LEMAC to the  distance from the datum to LEMAC.  [Figure 9-13]

3.	 Determine the moment/1,000 for the original weight.  [Figure 9-14]

Figure 9-14.  Determining the moment/1,000 for the original weight.  

4.	 Determine the new weight and new CG by first  determining the moment/1,000 of the removed weight.  Multiply the weight removed (2,500 pounds) by the  centroid of the forward cargo hold (352.1 inches), and  then divide the result by 1,000.  [Figure 9-15]  

![](images/0db4e5159d0f6eb52173e60cf197b0001b0834c92595d8e7336aff553b9bb5c5.jpg)

5.	 Subtract the removed weight from the original weight  and subtract the moment/1,000 of the removed weight  from the original moment/1,000.  [Figure 9-16]  

6.	 Determine the location of the new CG by dividing  the total moment/1,000 by the total weight and  multiplying this by the reduction factor of 1,000.  [Figure 9-17]  

![](images/f3278e8302e37b247535565379d10823ff41f2d45cb17f23535f3b13dc236fc9.jpg)  

Figure 9-17.  Determining the location of new CG.  

7.	 Convert the new CG location to percent MAC. First,  determine the distance between the CG location and  LEMAC.  [Figure 9-18]

Figure 9-19.  Determining the new CG in percent MAC.  

Loading 3,000 pounds of cargo into the forward cargo hold  moves the CG forward 5.51 inches, from 27.12 percent MAC  to 21.59 percent MAC.  

![Figure 9-16.  New weights and CG. ](images/11af9e4b4329e44a84ecb8bbbdee7a8b4a7f7f00dfa6ce15baa3c1a98407a6f2.jpg)  

# Effects of Shifting Cargo From One Hold to  Another  

When cargo is shifted from one cargo hold to another, the CG  changes, but the total weight of the aircraft remains the same.  

For example, use the following data:  

Loaded weight................................................. 90,000 lb Loaded CG. ............. station 580.97 (22.5 percent MAC) Forward cargo hold centroid. ........................  station 352 Aft cargo hold centroid. .............................  station 724.9 MAC...................................................................141.5 in LEMAC........................................................  station 549  

To determine the change in CG (∆CG) caused by shifting  2,500 pounds of cargo from the forward cargo hold to the  aft cargo hold, use the formula in  Figure 9-20 .  

![](images/7321349a9078b8fbf5c9f177532adaeb3937c5276d7bc69e75e1f4a48aa8fd9a.jpg)  
Figure 9-20.  Calculating the change in  $C G,$  , using index arms.  

Since the weight was shifted aft, the CG moved aft and the  CG change is positive. If the shift were forward, the CG  change would be negative.  

Before the cargo was shifted, the CG was located at station 

 580.97, which is 22.5 percent of MAC. The CG moved aft 

 10.36 inches, so the new CG is found using the formula from  Figure 9-21 .  

![](images/cbd77d3ca5ff286d91ba5c645c3e11b57eb89c38d164c2d7f7168f95a345d003.jpg)  

Figure 9-21.  Determining the new CG after shifting cargo weight.  

Convert the location of the CG in inches aft of the datum to  percent MAC by using the formula in  Figure 9-22 .  

The new CG in percent MAC caused by shifting the cargo is  the sum of the old CG plus the change in CG.  [Figure 9-23]  

![](images/682402f4085ea1f1438326f3b34e52d9137bd02bd82c97ee08d725232f07906d.jpg)  

Figure 9-22.  Converting the location of CG to percent MAC.  

New CG % MAC  $=$   Old CG ±   CG = 22.5% + 7.32% = 29.82% MAC  

Some AFMs locate the CG relative to an index point rather  than the datum or the MAC. An index point is a location  specifiedby the aircraft manufacturer from which arms used  in weight and balance computations are measured. Arms  measured from the index point are called index arms, and  objects ahead of the index point have negative index arms,  while those behind the index point have positive index arms.  

Use the same data as in the previous example, except for  these changes:  

Loaded CG. .......................... index arm of 0.97, which is  22.5 percent of MAC Index point. ................................... fuselage station 580.0 Forward cargo hold centroid. ...............–227.9 index arm Aft cargo hold centroid. .......................  $+144.9$   index arm MAC...................................................................141.5 in LEMAC...............................................  $-30.87$   index arm  

The weight was shifted 372.8 inches   $(-227.9+\Delta=+144.9$   $\Delta\,{=}372.8)$  ).  

The change in CG can be calculated by using this formula  found in  Figure 9-24 .  

![](images/113c997c188a4cd606f29be281e31a90e1a75282e9626fd73a64ea04693e157c.jpg)  

Figure 9-24.  Determining the change in CG caused by shifting  2,500 pounds of cargo.  

Since the weight was shifted aft, the CG moved aft, and the  CG change is positive. If the shift were forward, the CG  change would be negative. Before the cargo was shifted,  the CG was located at 0.97 index arm, which is 22.5 percent  MAC. The CG moved aft 10.36 inches, and the new CG is  shown using the formula in  Figure 9-25 .  

![](images/a63c99a176882100d0540518ed2ef786347ebcac843449433499fa922b72b58c.jpg)  
Figure 9-25.  Determining the new CG, moved aft 10.36 inches.  

The change in the CG in percent MAC is determined by using  the formula in  Figure 9-26 .

The new CG in percent MAC is the sum of the old CG plus  the change in CG.  [Figure 9-27]

Notice that the new CG is in the same location whether the  distances are measured from the datum or from the index  point.  

# Determining Cargo Pallet Loads and Floor  Loading Limits  

Each cargo hold has a structural floor loading limit based on  the weight of the load and the area over which this weight is  distributed. To determine the maximum weight of a loaded  cargo pallet that can be carried in a cargo hold, divide its total  weight, which includes the weight of the empty pallet and  its tie down devices, by its area in square feet. This load per  square foot must be equal to or less than the floor load limit.  

In this example, determine the maximum load that can be  placed on this pallet without exceeding the floorloading limit. Pallet dimensions. ..........................................36 by 48 in Empty pallet weight. ................................................47 lb Tie down devices.....................................................33 lb Floor load limit.............................169 lb per square foot  

The pallet has an area of 36 inches (3 feet) by 48 inches  (4 feet), which equals 12 square feet, and the floor has a  load limit of 169 pounds per square foot. Therefore, the total  weight of the loaded pallet can be   $169\times12\!=\!2\!,\!028$   pounds.  Subtracting the weight of the pallet and the tie down devices  gives an allowable load of 1,948 pounds   $(2,\!028\!-\![47+33])$  .  

Determine the floor loading limit that is needed to carry a  loaded cargo pallet having the following dimensions and  weights:  

Pallet dimensions . ...................................48.5 by 33.5 in Pallet weight ...........................................................44 lb Tiedown devices .....................................................27 lb Cargo weight . .....................................................786.5 lb  

First, determine the number of square feet of pallet area as  

![](images/47ffef8106aabeb85b2cf0047b77856543adea97d7a08373af826efa405da548.jpg)  
Figure 9-28.  Determining pallet area in square feet.  

shown in  Figure 9-28 . Then, determine the total weight of the loaded pallet: Pallet.....................................................................44.0 lb Tiedown devices ..................................................27.0 lb Cargo..................................................................786.5 lb Total. ...................................................................857.5 lb  

Determine the load imposed on the floorby the loaded pallet.  [Figure 9-29]  The floor must have a minimum loading limit  of 76 pounds per square foot.  

![](images/a6f52f74af7d828eebd2d0ac184572338e62dfcdf1eaac170d7460c6a37be42a.jpg)  

Figure 9-29.  Determining the load imposed on the floor by the  loaded pallet.  

# Determining the Maximum Amount of Payload  That Can Be Carried  

The primary function of a transport or cargo aircraft is to carry  payload, which is the portion of the useful load, passengers,  or cargo that produces revenue. To determine the maximum  amount of payload that can be carried, both the maximum  limits for the aircraft and the trip limits imposed by the  particular trip must be considered. In each of the following  steps, the trip limit must be less than the maximum limit. If  it is not, the maximum limit must be used.  

These are the specifications for the aircraft in this example  

Basic operating weight (BOW)......................100,500 lb Maximum zero fuel weight. ............................138,000 lb Maximum landing weight. ..............................142,000 lb Maximum takeoff weight...............................184,200 lb Fuel tank load ..................................................54,000 lb Estimated fuel burn en route. ............................40,000 lb  

1.	 Compute the maximum takeoff weight for this trip.  This is the maximum landing weight plus the trip fuel.  [Figure 9-30]  

![](images/e763c7d9bd346e6be5dace3532028b9600bcec07c091748e4a0f89882b6670d5.jpg)  
Figure 9-30.  Finding the maximum takeoff weight.  

2.	 The trip limit is lower than the maximum takeoff  weight, so it is used to determine the zero fuel weight.  [Figure 9-31]

Figure 9-31.  Determining zero fuel weight with lower trip limits.  

3.	 The trip limit is again lower than the maximum takeoff  weight, so use it to compute the maximum payload  for this trip.  [Figure 9-32]

Figure 9-32.  Finding maximum payload with lower trip limits.  

Under these conditions, 27,500 pounds of payload may be  carried.  

# Determining the Landing Weight  

It is important to know the landing weight of the aircraft in  order to set up the landing parameters and to be certain the  aircraft is able to land safely at the intended destination.  

In this example of a four-engine turboprop airplane,  determine the airplane weight at the end of 4.0 hours of cruise  under these conditions:  

Takeoff weight. ...............................................140,000 lb Pressure altitude during cruise. ..........................16,000 ft Ambient temperature during cruise......................  $-32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Fuel burned during descent and landing. ............1,350 lb  

Refer to the U.S. Standard Atmosphere Table in  Figure 9-33  and the gross weight table in  Figure 9-34  when  completing the following steps:  

1.	 Use the U.S. Standard Atmosphere Table to  determine the standard temperature for 16,000 feet   $(-16.7\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  .	 2.	 The ambient temperature is   $-32\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , which is a  deviation from standard of   $15.3~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .   $(-32^{\circ}-(-16.7^{\circ})$     $=-15.3^{\circ})$  ). It is below standard. 3.	 In the gross weight table, follow the vertical line  representing 140,000 pounds gross weight upward  until it intersects the diagonal line for 16,000 feet  pressure altitude. 4.	 From this intersection, draw a horizontal line to the left  to the temperature deviation index (  $\mathrm{{0}\,^{\circ}C}$   deviation). 5.	 Draw a diagonal line parallel to the dashed lines for  Below Standard from the intersection of the horizontal  line and the Temperature Deviation Index. 6.	 Draw a vertical line upward from the   $15.3~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    Temperature Deviation From Standard.

7.	 Draw a horizontal line to the left from the intersection  of the Below Standard diagonal and the   $15.3~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    temperature deviation vertical line. This line crosses  the fuel flow–100 pounds per hour per engine index  at 11.35 and indicates that each of the four engines  burns 1,135 (  $(100\times11.35)$   pounds of fuel per hour.  The total fuel burn for the 4-hour cruise is shown in  Figure 9-35 .  

The airplane gross weight was 140,000 pounds at takeoff  with 18,160 pounds of fuel burned during cruise and 1,350  pounds burned during the approach and landing phase. This  leaves a landing weight of   $140{,}000\,-\,(18{,}160\,+\,1{,}350)=$    120,490 pounds.

# Determining Fuel Dump Time in Minutes  

Most large aircraft are approved for a greater weight for  takeoff than for landing. To make it possible for them to  return to landing soon after takeoff, a fuel jettison system is  sometimes installed. It is important in an emergency situation  that the flight crew be able to dump enough fuel to lower the  weight to its allowed landing weight. This is done by timing  the dumping process.  

In this example, the aircraft has two engines operating and  these specifications apply  

Cruise weight. .................................................171,000 lb Maximum landing weight. ..............................142,500 lb Time from start of dump to landing. .............. 19 minutes  

Average fuel flow during  

Dumping and descent..............................3,170 lb/hr/eng Fuel dump rate........................................2,300 lb/minute  

To calculate the fuel dump time in minutes:  

1.	 Determine the amount of weight the aircraft must  lose to reach the maximum allowable landing weight.  [Figure 9-36]  

171,000 lb cruise weight – 142,500 lb maximum landing weight      28,500 lb required reduction  

Figure 9-36.  Determining the amount of weight the aircraft must  lose to reach the maximum allowable landing weight.  

2.	 Determine the amount of fuel burned from the  beginning of the dump to touchdown.  [Figure 9-37]  

Fuel flow  $=$    60 = 52.83 lb/min engine  

For both engines, this is  $52.83\times2=105.66\;\mathrm{lb/minupt}$  e.  

The engines burn 105.66 lbs of fuel per min for 19 minutes  (the duration of the dump), which calculates to 2007.54  pounds of fuel burned between the beginning of the dump  and touchdown.  

3.	 Determine the amount of fuel needed to dump by  subtracting the amount of fuel burned during the dump  from the required weight reduction.  [Figure 9-38]  

28,500.00 lb required weight reduction    – 2,007.54 lb fuel burned after start of dumping     26,492.46 lb fuel to be dumped  

Figure 9-38.  Determining the amount of fuel needed to dump.  

4.	 Determine the time needed to dump this amount of  fuel by dividing the number of pounds of fuel to dump  by the dump rate.  [Figure 9-39]  

${\frac{26,492.46}{2,300}}={}$  = 11.52 minutes

# Weight and Balance of Commuter Category  Airplanes  

The Beech 1900 is a typical commuter category airplane that  can be configured to carry passengers or cargo.  Figure 9-40   shows the loading data of this type of airplane in the  passenger configuration  

# Determining the Loaded Weight and CG  

As this airplane is prepared for flight,a manifest is prepared. [Figure 9-41]  

Figure 9-37.  Determining the amount of fuel burned from the  beginning of the dump to touchdown.  

![](images/70ef3bd8d6f74e3f4ccabb080e049af91a0382c613e3b9b81468d08ad20d351b.jpg)  

![Figure 9-40.  Loading data for passenger configuration. ](images/ed0b9ffb5b7223051a8a127562ab4e5cfffa694ef4b448a116b13f7ef0757f30.jpg)  

1.	 The crew weight and the weight of each passenger is  entered into the manifest. The moment/100 for each  occupant is determined by multiplying the weight by  the arm and dividing by 100. This data is available in  the AFM and is shown in the Weight and Moments—  Occupants table.  [Figure 9-42]  

2.	 The weight of the baggage in each compartment used  is entered with its moment/100. This is determined  in the Weights and Moments—Baggage table.  [Figure 9-43]  

![](images/369bce25cffc6ef8be43031456256a7624f2383f03498aadf2a1dd05740f559b.jpg)  

3.	 Determine the weight of the fuel. Jet A fuel has  a nominal specific gravity at   $+15~{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   of 0.812  and weighs 6.8 pounds per gallon, but at   $+25\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,  according to the Density Variation of Aviation Fuel  Chart  [Figure 9-44] , it weighs  $6.75\,\mathrm{1b/cal}$  . Using this  

![](images/69913adaaf4048b5b47829c1d0cc043ff7705952f49880de021d4df28e26a493.jpg)  

![](images/ce0ffe84717e95481168dec9a266d1db8b8a9e7d5559d6eae6e94c4656e1fca3.jpg)  
Figure 9-44.  Density variation of aviation fuel.  

chart, determine the weights and moment/100 for 390  gallons of Jet A fuel by interpolating between those  for  $6.7\,\mathrm{lb/gapal}$   and  $6.8\,\mathrm{lb/cal}$  . The 390 gallons of fuel at  this temperature weighs 2,633 pounds, and its moment  index is 7,866 lb-in/100.  

4.	 Add all of the weights and all of the moment indexes.  Divide the total moment index by the total weight, and  multiply this by the reduction factor of 100. The total  weight is 14,729 pounds; the total moment index is  43,139 lb-in/100. The CG is located at fuselage station  292.9.  [Figure 9-45]  

5.	 Check to determine that the CG is within limits for  this weight. Refer to the Weight and Balance Diagram.  [Figure 9-46]  Draw a horizontal line across the  envelope at 14,729 pounds of weight and a vertical  line from the CG of 292.9 inches aft of the datum.  These lines cross inside the envelope, verifying the  CG is within limits for this weight.

# Determining the Changes in CG When  Passengers Are Shifted  

Using the loaded weight and CG of the Beech 1900, calculate  the change in CG when the passengers in rows 1 and 2 are  moved to rows 8 and 9.  [Figure 9-47]  Note that there is no  weight change, but the moment index has been increased by  1,155 pound-inches/100 to 44,294. The new CG is at fuselage  station 300.7.  [Figure 9-48]  

This type of problem is usually solved by using the following  two formulas. The total amount of weight shifted is 550  pounds   $(300+250)$   and both rows of passengers have moved  aft by 210 inches (410 – 200 and 440 – 230). The CG has  been shifted aft by 7.8 inches, and the new CG is at station  300.7.  [Figure 9-49]  

![Figure 9-47.  Changes in CG caused by shifting passenger seats. ](images/c1a1496fa3de758f505e7c1815b18f9b54ef00cad2dbc9944230283864c52a5f.jpg)

Figure 9-49.  Determining the new CG at station after CG has  shifted aft.  

In a large cabin aircraft with high-density seating such as  the B737-800, the operator must account for the seating of  passengers in the cabin  [Figure 9-50] . If assigned seating  is used to determine passenger location, the operator  must implement procedures to ensure the assignment of  passenger seating is incorporated into the loading procedure.  

It is recommended that the operator take into account the  possibility that some passengers may not sit in their assigned  seats.  

If the actual seating location of each passenger is not known,  the operator may assume that all passengers are seated  uniformly throughout the cabin or a specified subsection of  the cabin. Reasonable assumptions can be made about the  manner in which people distribute themselves throughout  the cabin. For example, window seats are occupied first   followed by aisle seats, followed by the remaining seats  (window-aisle-remaining seating). Both forward and rear  loading conditions should be considered. The passengers may  fill up the window, aisle, and remaining seats from the front  of the aircraft to the back, or the back to the front.  

If necessary, the operator may divide the passenger cabin  into subsections or zones and manage the loading of each  zone individually. It can be assumed that passengers will be  sitting uniformly throughout each zone.  

Another consideration is the in flight movement of passengers,  crew, and equipment. It is assumed that all passengers, crew,  and equipment are secured when the aircraft is in the takeoff  or landing configuration. Standard operating procedures  

![](images/1b70ecd901948f145f7451ef9fab32fa0dcdc1563822162c673bdf2735148fea.jpg)  
Figure 9-50.  One passenger configuration of a B737-800.  

should be taken into account. Examples of items that can  move during flight are:  

•	 Flight deck crew members moving to the lavatory.  •	 Flight attendants moving throughout the cabin.  •	 Service carts moving throughout the cabin. •	 Passengers moving throughout the cabin. •	 Passengers moving to the lavatory.  

# Determining Changes in Weight and CG  When the Aircraft Is Operated in Its Cargo  Configuratio  

To determine changes in weight and CG when the aircraft  is operated in its cargo configuration, the Beech 1900 is  used as an example.  Figure 9-51  illustrates the airplane  configuration. Notice that the arm of each cargo section is  the centroid of that section.  

The flight manifest of the Beech 1900 in the cargo  confi uration is illustrated in  Figure 9-52 . The BOW includes  the pilots and their baggage and there is no separate item  for them.  

At the standard temperature of   $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the fuel weighs 6.8  pounds per gallon. Refer to  Figure 9-45  to determine the  weight and moment index of 370 gallons of Jet A fuel. The  CG under these loading conditions is located at station 296.2.  

# Determining the CG Shift When Cargo Is Moved  From One Section to Another  

To calculate the CG when cargo is shifted from one section  to another, use the formula found in  Figure 9-53 . If the cargo  is moved forward, the CG is subtracted from the original CG.  If the cargo is shifted aft, add the CG to the original.  

# Determining the CG Shift When Cargo Is Added  or Removed  

To calculate the CG when cargo is added or removed, add or  subtract the weight and moment index of the affected cargo to  the original loading chart. Determine the new CG by dividing  the new moment index by the new total weight, and multiply  this by the reduction factor.  [Figure 9-54]  

# Determining Which Limits Are Exceeded  

When preparing an aircraft for flight,consider all parameters  and check to determine that no limits have been exceeded.  Consider the parameters below, and determine which limit,  if any, has been exceeded.  

•	 The aircraft in this example has a basic empty weight  of 9,005 pounds and a moment index of 25,934 pound  inches/100.  

![](images/0c60456d2e43601a78ef07cd8247fbb74b73b6e009258e56fcbf4ec55d595b80.jpg)  
Loading cargo configuration  

•	 The crew weight is 340 pounds and its moment/100  is 439.

 •	 The passengers and baggage have a weight of 3,950  pounds and a moment/100 of 13,221.

 •	 The fuel is computed at   $6.8\ \mathrm{lb/gapal}$  . The ramp load is  340 gallons or 2,312 pounds. Fuel used for start and  taxi is 20 gallons, or 136 pounds. Fuel remaining at  landing is 100 gallons, or 680 pounds.

 •	 Maximum takeoff weight is 16,600 pounds.

 •	 Maximum zero fuel weight is 14,000 pounds.

 •	 Maximum landing weight is 16,000 pounds.

Figure 9-54.  Determining the new CG by dividing the new moment  index by the new total weight, multiplied by the reduction factor.  

Take these steps to determine which limit, if any, is exceeded:  

1.	 Determine the zero fuel weight, which is the weight  of the aircraft with all of the useful load except the  fuel onboard.  [Figure 9-55]  

![Figure 9-55.  Determining the zero fuel weight. ](images/145c87d5e79ae943b58ea617550c990f532df934fd30f223b27f0f6c9b0d2191.jpg)  

The zero fuel weight of 13,295 pounds is less than  the maximum of 14,000 pounds, so this parameter is  acceptable.  

2.	 Determine the takeoff weight and CG. The takeoff  weight is the zero fuel weight plus the weight of the  ramp load of fuel, minus the weight of the fuel used  

for start and taxi. The takeoff CG is the moment/100  divided by the weight, and then the result multiplied  by 100. The takeoff weight of 15,471 pounds is below  the maximum takeoff weight of 16,600 pounds, and a  check of the weight and balance diagram shows that the  CG at station 298.0 is also within limits.  [Figure 9-56]  

![Figure 9-56.  Determining the takeoff weight and CG. ](images/bba46f918b881d72dee69ad220d67587a93309b700fdf48298fc0310d035e166.jpg)  

3.	 Determine the landing weight and CG. This is the zero fuel  weight plus the weight of fuel at landing.  [Figure 9-57]  

![Figure 9-57.  Determining the landing weight and CG. ](images/75dd6206cc558064ac4f1ac778c771a2b081055d03496c98a6ade496f41b1826.jpg)  

The landing weight of 13,975 pounds is less than the  maximum landing weight of 14,000 to 16,000 pounds.  According to the weight and balance diagram, the  landing CG at station 297.5 is also within limits.  

# Use of Computer for Weight  and Balance Computations  

# Introduction  

Almost all weight and balance problems involve only simple  math. This allows slide rules and hand-held electronic  calculators to relieve much of the tedium involved with these  problems. This chapter compares the methods of determining  the center of gravity (CG) of an airplane while it is being  weighed. First, it shows how to determine the CG using a  simple electronic calculator, then solves the same problem  using an E6-B flightcomputer. Finally, it shows how to solve  it using a dedicated electronic flight computer  

Examples of typical weight and balance problems (solved  with an electronic calculator) that pilots and airframe and  powerplant (A&P) maintenance technicians encounter  throughout their aviation endeavors are shown later in this  chapter.  

# Electronic Calculator  

Determining the CG of an airplane in inches for the main- wheel weighing points can be done with any simple electronic  calculator that has addition  $(+)$  , subtraction  $(-)$  , multiplication   $(\times)$  , and division   $\left(\div\right)$   functions.  [Figure 10-1]  Scientifi   calculators with such additional functions as memory (M),  parentheses (( )), plus or minus   $(+/-)$  , exponential   $\mathrm{({\bfy}^{x})}$  ,  reciprocal   $(1/\mathbf{x})$  , and percentage   $(\%)$   functions allow more  complex problems to be solved or simple problems to be  solved using fewer steps.  

![](images/d5582365e84d676453b549d3f66fc0ff8cbc2f0e8a26676b118a802248f3c3ce.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.  A typical electronic calculator is useful for solving  most types of weight and balance problems.  

According to  Figure 10-2 , the weight of the nosewheel (F) is  340 pounds, the distance between main wheels and nosewheel  (L) is  $-78$   inches, and the total weight (W) of the airplane is  2,006 pounds. L is negative because the nosewheel is ahead  of the main wheels.  

![Figure 10-2.  Weight and balance data of a typical nosewheel  airplane. ](images/e58bf77c223b725faab25d2442ee43b7ae4fe7a8642c6eceee2b14547f81eb88.jpg)  

To determine the CG, use this formula:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathrm{CG}=\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{\boldmath~F~}\times\mathrm{\boldmath~L~}}{\mathrm{\boldmath~W~}}}}\\ {~~}\\ {{\mathrm{\boldmath~\Gamma~}=\displaystyle\frac{340\times-78}{2,006}}}\end{array}
$$  

Key the data into the calculator and press the equal  $(=)$   key. The answer should read as follows:  

$$
(340)(\times)(78)(+/-)(\div)(2006)(=)-13.2
$$  

The arm of the nosewheel is negative, so the CG is  $-13.2$   or  13.2 inches ahead of the main wheel weighing points.  

# E6-B Flight Computer  

The E6-B uses a special kind of slide rule. Instead of its scales  going from 1 to 10, as on a normal slide rule, both scales  go from 10 to 100. The E6-B cannot be used for addition or  subtraction, but it is useful for making calculations involving  multiplication and division. Its accuracy is limited, but it is  sufficiently accurate for most weight and balance problems.  

The same problem that was just solved with the electronic  calculator can be solved on an E6-B by following these steps:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle{\mathrm{CG}}=\frac{\mathrm{~F~}\times\mathrm{~L~}}{\mathrm{~W~}}}}\\ {~~}\\ {~~}\\ {=\displaystyle{\frac{340\times-78}{2,006}}}\end{array}
$$  

First, multiply 340 by 78 (disregard the minus sign)  [Figure 10-3] :  

•	 Step 1—place 10 on the inner scale (this is the index  opposite 34 on the outer scale that represents 340). •	 Step 2—opposite 78 on the inner scale, read 26.5 on  the outer scale. 	 Determine the value of these digits by estimating:   $300\times80=24{,}000$  , so   $340\times78=26{,}500$  . 	 Then, divide 26,500 by 2,006  [Figure 10-4] :  

![](images/48fc7d62203ba11a703a9834e33830d3de512542393718c6f0b2cd4f4b8049a1.jpg)

Figure 10-4.  E6-B computer set up to divide 26,500 by 2,006.  

•	 Step 3—on the inner scale, place 20, which represents  2,006 opposite 26.5 on the outer scale (26.5 represents  26,500). •	 Step 4—opposite the index, 10, on the inner scale read  13.2 on the outer scale. 	 Determine the value of 13.2 by estimating:   $20{,}000\div2000=10$  , so   $26{,}500\div2{,}006=13.2$  . 	 The arm (–78) is negative, so the CG is also negative.  

The CG is –13.2 inches or 13.2 inches ahead of the datum.  

# Dedicated Electronic Flight Computer  

Dedicated electronic flight computers, like the one in  Figure 10-5,  are programmed to solve many flightproblems  such as wind correction, heading and ground speed,  endurance, and true airspeed (TAS), as well as weight and  balance problems.  

![](images/787753ab38b6336a4168020486fce657663ab05123e1197c580733c10084de24.jpg)  
Figure 10-5.  Dedicated electronic flight computers are programmed  to solve weight and balance problems, as well as flight problems.  

The problem just solved with an electronic calculator and  an E6-B can also be solved with a dedicated flight computer  using the information shown in  Figure 10-2 . Each fligh   computer handles the problems in a slightly different way,  but all are programmed with prompts that solicit the required  data to be inputted so there is no need to memorize any  formulas. Weight and arms are inputted as called for, and a  running total of the weight, moment, and CG are displayed.  

# Typical Weight and Balance Problems  

A hand-held electronic calculator like the one in  Figure 10-5 is a valuable tool for solving weight and balance problems. It  can be used for a variety of problems and has a high degree  of accuracy. The examples given here are solved with a  calculator using only the  $\mathrm{(\times),(\div),(+),(\,-\,)}$  , and  $(+/-)$   functions.  If other functions are available on your calculator, some of  the steps may be simplified  

# Determining CG in Inches From the Datum  

This type of problem is solved by firs  determining the  location of the CG in inches from the main wheel weighing  points, then measuring this location in inches from the datum.  There are four types of problems involving the location of  the CG relative to the datum.  

# Nosewheel Airplane With Datum Ahead of the  Main Wheels  

The datum (D) is 128 inches ahead of the main wheel  weighing points; the weight of the nosewheel (F) is 340  pounds, and the distance between main wheels and nosewheel  (L) is 78 inches. The total weight (W) of the airplane is 2,006  pounds. Refer to  Figure 3-5  on page 3-5.  

Use this formula:  

$$
\mathrm{CG}=\mathrm{D}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{F}\times\mathrm{~L~}}{\mathrm{~w~}}\right)
$$  

1. 	 Determine the CG in inches from the main wheel:  $(340)(\times)(78)(\div)(2006)(=)\;13.2$  2. 	 Determine the CG in inches form the datum:  $(128)(-)(13.2)(=)\;114.8$  	 The CG is 114.8 inches behind the datum.  

# Nosewheel Airplane With Datum Behind the Main  Wheels  

The datum (D) is 75 inches behind the main wheel weighing  points, the weight of the nosewheel (F) is 340 pounds, and  the distance between main wheels and nosewheel (L) is 78  inches. The total weight (W) of the airplane is 2,006 pounds.  Refer to  Figure 3-6  on page 3-5.  

Use this formula:  

$$
\mathrm{CG}=-\left(\mathrm{D}+\frac{\mathrm{F}\times\mathrm{~L}}{\mathrm{~W~}}\right)
$$  

2. 	 Determine the CG in inches from the datum:  

$$
(75)(+)(13.2)(=)\;88.2
$$  

The minus sign before the parenthesis in the formula  means the answer is negative. The CG is 88.2 inches  ahead of the datum (–88.2).  

# Tailwheel Airplane With Datum Ahead of the Main  Wheels  

The datum (D) is 7.5 inches ahead of the main wheel  weighing points, the weight of the tailwheel (R) is 67 pounds,  and the distance between main wheels and tailwheel (L) is  222 inches. The total weight (W) of the airplane is 1,218  pounds. Refer to  Figure 3-7  on page 3-6.  

Use this formula:  

$$
\mathrm{CG}=\left(\mathrm{D}+\frac{\mathrm{R}\times\mathrm{~L}}{\mathrm{~W~}}\right)
$$  

1. 	 Determine the CG in inches from the main wheels.  

$$
(67)(\times)(222)(\div)(1218)(=)\;12.2
$$  

2. 	 Determine the CG in inches from the datum:  $(7.5)(+)(12.2)(=)\,19.7$  	 The CG is 19.7 inches behind the datum.  

# Tailwheel Airplane With Datum Behind the Main  Wheels  

The datum (D) is 80 inches behind the main wheel weighing  points, the weight of the tailwheel (R) is 67 pounds, and the  distance between main wheels and tailwheel (L) is 222 inches.  The total weight (W) of the airplane is 1,218 pounds. Refer  to  Figure 3-8  on page 3-6.

# Determining CG, Given Weights, and Arms  

Some weight and balance problems involve weights and arms  to determine the moments. Divide the total moment by the  total weight to determine the CG.  Figure 10-6  contains the  specifications for determining the CG using weights and arms.  

Determine the CG by using the data in  Figure 10-6  and  following these steps:  

1. 	 Determine the total weight and record this number:  $(830)(+)(836)(+)(340)(=)\;2,006$  2. 	 Determine the moment of each weighing point and 	 record them:  $\begin{array}{l}{(830)(\times)(128)(=)\;106,240}\\ {(836)(\times)(128)(=)\;107,008}\\ {(340)(\times)(50)(=)\;17,000}\end{array}$  3. 	 Determine the total moment and divide this by the  total weight: 	  $(106240)(+)(107008)(+)(17000)(=)(\div)(2006)(=)$  114.8  

This airplane weighs 2,006 pounds and its CG is 114.8 inches  from the datum.  

# Determining CG, Given Weights, and Moment  Indexes  

Other weight and balance problems involve weights and  moment indexes, such as moment/100 or moment/1,000. To  determine the CG, add all the weights and all the moment  indexes. Then, divide the total moment index by the total  weight and multiply the answer by the reduction factor.  Figure 10-7  contains the specifications for determining the

1. 	 Determine the total weight and record this number:  $(830)(+)(836)(+)(340)(=)\;2,006$  2. 	 Determine the total moment index, divide this by the  total weight, and multiply it by the reduction factor  of 100:  $\begin{array}{l}{(1062.4)(+)(1070.1)(+)(170)(=)(2302.5)(+)(2006)(=)}\\ {(1.148)(\times)(100)(=)114.8}\end{array}$  

This airplane weighs 2,006 pounds and its CG is 114.8 inches  from the datum.  

# Determining CG in Percent Mean Aerodynamic  Chord (MAC)  

• 	 The loaded CG is 42.47 inches aft of the datum. • 	 MAC is 61.6 inches long. • 	 LEMAC is at station 20.1. 1. 	 Determine the distance between the CG and LEMAC:  $(42.47)(-)(20.1)(=)\;22.37$  2. 	 Then, use this formula:  $(22.37)(\times)(100)(\div)(61.6)(=)\;36.3$  

The CG of this airplane is located at 36.3 percent MAC.  

# Determining Lateral CG of a Helicopter  

For a helicopter, it is often necessary to determine not only  the longitudinal CG, but the lateral CG as well. Lateral CG is  measured from butt line zero (BL 0). All items and moments  to the left of BL 0 are negative, and all those to the right of  BL 0 are positive.  Figure 10-8  contains the specifications for  determining the lateral CG of a typical helicopter.  

Determine the lateral CG by using the data in  Figure 10-8  and  following these steps:  

1. 	 Add all of the weights:  $545)(+)(170)(+)(200)(+)(288)(=)2,203$  2. 	 Multiply the lateral arm (the distance between butt  line zero and the CG of each item) by its weight to  get the lateral offset moment of each item. Moments  to the right of BL 0 are positive and those to the left  are negative.  $(1,545)(\times)(.2)(=)\,309$   $0)(\times)(13.5)(+/-)(=)-2,295$   $(200)(\times)(13.5)(=)\;2,700$   $(288)(\times)(8.4)(+/-)(=)\,-2{,}419$  3. 	 Determine the algebraic sum of the lateral offset  moments. 	  $(309)(+)(2295)(+/-)(+)(2700)(+)(2419)(+/-)(=)$  –1,705 4. 	 Divide the sum of the moments by the total weight to  determine the lateral CG.  $(1705)(+/-)(+)(2203)(=)-0.77$  

The lateral CG is 0.77 inch to the left of BL0.  

# Determining ΔCG Caused by Shifting Weights  

Fifty pounds of baggage is shifted from the aft baggage  compartment at station 246 to the forward compartment at  station 118. The total airplane weight is 4,709 pounds. How  much does the CG shift?  

1. 	 Determine the number of inches the baggage is shifted:  $(246)(-)(118)(=)\;128$  2. 	 Use this formula:  $\begin{array}{l l}{\Delta\ \mathrm{CG}=\frac{\mathrm{weight~shifted}\times\mathrm{Dissipation~weight~is~shifted}}{\mathrm{Total~weight}}}\\ {\ }\\ {(50)(\times)(128)(\div)(4709)(=)\ 1.36}\end{array}$  

# Determining Weight Shifted to Cause Specified ΔCG  

How much weight must be shifted from the aft baggage  compartment at station 246 to the forward compartment  at station 118 to move the CG forward 2 inches? The total  weight of the airplane is 4,709 pounds.  

1. 	 Determine the number of inches the baggage is shifted:  ${\mathrm{Weibt~shift}}={\frac{\mathrm{Total~weight~shift}\times\Delta\;{\mathrm{CG}}}{\mathrm{Distance~weight~is~shift}}}$  2. 	 Use this formula:  $(2)(\times)(4709)(\div)(128)(=)73.6$  

Moving 73.6 pounds of baggage from the aft compartment  to forward compartment shifts the CG forward 2 inches.  

# Determining Distance Weight Is Shifted to Move  CG a Specific Distanc  

How many inches aft does a 56 pound battery need to be  moved to shift the CG aft by 1.5 inches? The total weight of  the airplane is 4,026 pounds.  

Use this formula:  

Total weight   × ∆ CG Distance weight is shifted  $=$                                                    Weight shifted  

$$
)(\times)(4026)(\div)(56)(=)107.8
$$  

Moving the battery aft by 107.8 inches shifts the CG aft 1.5  inches.  

The CG is shifted forward 1.36 inches.  

![Figure 10-8.  Specifications for determining the lateral CG of a helicopter. ](images/9880bf23d154fd32d2ee42a4221983adcb4eaa766babb7ff9389f274a661b4b3.jpg)  

# Determining Total Weight of an Aircraft With a  Specified ΔCG When Cargo Is Move  

What is the total weight of an airplane if moving 500 pounds  of cargo 96 inches forward shifts the CG 2.0 inches?  

Use this formula:  

Weight shifted × Distance weight is shifted Total weight  $=

$                                                        ∆ CG  

(500)(×)(96)(÷)(2)(=) 24,000  

Moving 500 pounds of cargo 96 inches forward causes a  2.0-inch shift in CG of a 24,000-pound airplane.  

# Determining Amount of Ballast Needed to Move  CG to a Desired Location  

How much ballast must be mounted at station 228 to move  the CG to its forward limit of   $+33?$   The airplane weighs  1,876 pounds and the CG is at  $+32.2$  , a distance of 0.8 inch  out of limit.  

Use this formula:  

Aircraft empty weight  $\times$    Dist. out of limits  Ballast weight  $=$  	 	         Distance ballast to desired CG  

$$
(1876)(\times)(.8)(\div)(195)(=)\;7.7
$$  

Attaching 7.7 pounds of ballast to the bulkhead at station  228 moves the CG to  $+33.0$  .

# Glossary  

A note on glossary terms: over the years there has been a  proliferation of aircraft weight and balance terms. This is  the result of many factors, such as the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) certification regulation under which  an aircraft was constructed; the FAA regulation under which  the aircraft is being operated; manufacturer standardization  agreements or a combination of these and others. Examples  of such terms are empty weight, licensed empty weight, basic  empty weight, operational empty weight, etc.  

Many of these terms may have similar meanings or sound  similar. Pilots and aircraft mechanics must ensure they  understand the terminology and are applying the correct  values based on the procedure and situation dictating the  calculations undertaken.  

Occasionally, the acronym “GAMA” follows the glossary  term. This indicates that it is part of the standardized format  adopted by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association  in 1976, known as GAMA SpecificationNo.1. These aircraft  are usually manufactured under Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 23 and differ from aircraft  manufactured under the earlier certification rule Civil Air  Regulation (CAR) part 3 for weight and balance purposes  in the condition under which empty weight was established.  

Aircraft certific ted under 14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, and 29  establish their certificated empty weight as required in the  appropriate section of these regulations, which states that the  empty weight and corresponding center of gravity (CG) must  be determined by weighting the aircraft with:  

• 	 Fixed ballast • 	 Unusable fuel • 	 Full operating flu d, including oil, hydraulic flu d,  and other fluids required for normal operation of  the aircraft systems, except potable water, lavatory  precharge water, and water intended for injection in  the engine(s).  

In contrast, aircraft certificated under the older CARs  established certifi ated empty weight under similar conditions  as the newer aircraft, with the important exception that the  aircraft weight did not include full oil, only undrainable oil.  Mechanics and repair stations should consult the appropriate  certification rule when reestablishing empty weight
