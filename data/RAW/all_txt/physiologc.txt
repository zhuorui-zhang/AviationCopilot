# FAA Aeromedical Training Programs for Civil  Aviation Pilots  

Physiological Training Course.  The FAA Civil Aerospace  Medical Institute (CAMI) offers a 1-day training course to  familiarize U.S. civil aviation pilots and flight crews with the  physiological and psychological stresses of flight.  

Why Is Training Necessary?  Pilots who are knowledgeable  about physiological phenomena encountered in the aviation  environment are better prepared to deal with such potentially  fatal inflight events as:  

• loss of cabin pressure 

 • hypoxia 

 • spatial disorientation 

 • trapped gas problems 

 • decompression sickness 

 • acceleration forces leading to gray-out, black-out, or even   unconsciousness 

 • noise, vibration, and thermal stress 

 • self-imposed stresses that can magnify any of the above  physiological events.  

Flying Above 10,000 Feet?  The U.S. Code of Federal Re­ gulations, Title 14, Part 61.31 (g)(1-3) prescribes the know­ ledge and skill requirements for the various airman certifica­ tes and ratings. Several civil aviation airframes are capable  of flight in the high-altitude environment. Pilots operating  aircraft in the high-altitude environment must receive certain  knowledge in the critical factors regarding the physiological  aspects of flight operations.  

For these reasons, CAMI offers physiological training for civil  aviation pilots, FAA flight crews, and FAA aviation medical  examiners at our facilities in Oklahoma City, Okla. In additi­ on to the basic academic contents, this course offers practical  demonstrations of rapid decompression (8,000 to 18,000 feet  AGL), hypoxia (25,000 feet AGL), and visual acuity (18,000  feet AGL) in a hypobaric (altitude) chamber or the ability to  experience hypoxia in a normobaric hypoxia training device  that simulates altitude by reducing oxygen percentage wihout  reducing atmospheric pressure. Also included in this course is  a safe, practical demonstration of spatial disorientation in the  General Aviation Spatial Disorientation Demonstrator.  

Night Vision.  Demonstrations and orientation to night visi­ on devices.  

Scheduling.  To schedule your training, we will need the fol­ lowing information:  

• Full Name 

 • Date of birth 

 • Mailing Address 

 • Daytime phone number 

 • Country of origin (if other than U.S.)  

Applying.  When you are assigned a training date, you will  receive a confirmation letter. Bring the notification letter and  your current medical certificate on the day of training.

The Spatial Disorientation Simulator is used to demonstra­ te the effects of vertigo in a safe, ground-based environ­ ment. Students use this trainer as part of the physiology  training course. It is also often seen at airshows and  special aviation events across the U.S. Built for the Civil  Aerospace Medical Institute, the trainer is awaiting your  clearance to “take off” on a personal training mission to  improve your vertigo awareness.  

Restrictions.  Participation in an altitude chamber flight will  not be permitted if the applicant:  

• does not hold a valid class I, II, or III medical certificate 

 • has an acute respiratory and/or systemic infection 

 • has a beard 

 • has been scuba diving within 24 hours 

 • has donated one unit   $(500~\mathrm{ml)}$  ) of blood within 24 hours or  donated more than one unit of blood within 72 hours of  the scheduled training  • has consumed any alcoholic beverage within eight hours or  is under the influence of alcohol  • is less than 18 years of age  

Certificate.  Upon completion of the course, you will receive  a certificate noting that you have completed the FAA’s Phy­ siological Training course. This training does not satisfy all  requirements for the high-altitude endorsement; no logbook  annotation is made.  

Basic Survival Skills for General Aviation Pilots.  CAMI’s  Aerospace Medical Education Division offers a free survival  course for general aviation pilots at its facilities in Oklaho­ ma City, Okla. Topics included in this 8-hour introductory  course:  

• basic knowledge and skills to cope with common survival  scenarios

 • psychology of survival 

 • hotland and coldland environments 

 • signaling and fire starting methods 

 • how to easily assemble and use a personal survival kit

Survival practice in a realistic outdoors setting.  

Practice sessions are conducted using a thermal chamber, a  ditching tank, and an emergency smoke evacuation aircraft  simulator (as available).
