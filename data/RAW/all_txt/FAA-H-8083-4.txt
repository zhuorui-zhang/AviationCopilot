# Helicopter Instructor’s  Handbook  

2012  

# Preface  

The Helicopter Instructor’s Handbook is designed as a technical manual for applicants who are preparing for their flight  instructor pilot certificate with a helicopter class rating. This handbook contains detailed coverage of aerodynamics, flight  controls, systems, performance, flight maneuvers, emergencies, and aeronautical decision-making. Topics such as weather,  navigation, radio navigation and communications, use of flight information publications, and regulations are available in  other Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications.  

This handbook conforms to flight instructor pilot training and certification concepts established by the FAA. There are  different ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations in the explanations  of aerodynamic theories and principles. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action  is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of  the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from www.faa.gov.  

This handbook is published by the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Airman  Testing Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125.

# Introduction to  Flight Training  

# Purpose of Flight Training  

It is the helicopter instructor’s responsibility to discuss the  overall purpose of flight training with the student. Explain  that the goal of flight training is the acquisition and honing  of basic airmanship skills that provide the student with:  

•	 An understanding of the principles of flight. •	 The ability to safely operate a helicopter with  competence and precision both on the ground and in  the air.  

•	 The knowledge required to exercise sound judgment  when making decisions affecting operational safety  and efficiency.  

Ensure the student understands that a helicopter operates in  a three-dimensional environment and requires specific skills  to control the aircraft:  

•	 Coordination—the ability to use the hands and feet  together subconsciously and in the proper relationship  to produce desired results in the helicopter control. •	 Control touch—to develop the ability to sense and  evaluate the varying pressures and resistance of  the control surfaces and/or the instructor’s input  transmitted through the cockpit flight controls and  apply inputs in response to those pressures. •	 Timing—the application of muscular coordination  at the proper instant to make maneuvering flight a  constant smooth process. •	 Mental comprehension of aerodynamic state, power  required versus power available, and hazards present.  

Keep in mind that an accomplished pilot demonstrates the  ability to assess a situation quickly and accurately and to  determine the correct procedure to be followed under the  circumstance; to analyze accurately the probable results of  a given set of circumstances or of a proposed procedure; to  exercise care and due regard for safety; to gauge accurately  the performance of the aircraft; and to recognize personal  limitations and limitations of the aircraft and avoid  approaching the critical points of each. The development  of airmanship skills requires effort and dedication on the  part of both the student and the flight instructor. It begins  with the first training flight when the instructor encourages  proper habit formation by introducing and modeling safe  operating practices.  

While every aircraft has its own particular flight characteristics,  the purpose of primary and intermediate flight training is not  to learn how to fly a particular make and model of helicopter;  it is to develop skills and safe habits that are transferable to  any helicopter.  [Figure 1-1]  Basic airmanship skills serve as  a firm foundation for this. Acquiring necessary airmanship  skills during training and demonstrating these skills by  flying with precision and safe flying habits allows the pilot  to transition easily to more complex helicopters. Remember,  the goal of flight training is to become a safe and competent  pilot, and that passing required tests for pilot certification is  only the first step toward this goal.  

# Practical Flight Instructor Strategies  

As discussed in Chapter 8 of the Aviation Instructor  Handbook, certificated flight instructors (CFIs) should  remember they are a role model for the student. The flight  instructor should demonstrate good aviation air sense and  practices at all times.  

![](images/44d2d4730efcdf888b0122725e95793d173d92f606404ec18d064f75bbf28b5f.jpg)  
Figure 1-1.   As part of flight training, a pilot instructs a student on  proper techniques for landing at an airport.  

For the helicopter CFI, this means:  

•	 Before the flight—discuss the procedures for the  exchange of controls, establish scan areas for clearing  the aircraft, and establish who is responsible for  initiating immediate action in an emergency. •	 During flight—prioritize the tasks of aviating,  navigating, and communicating. Instill the importance  of “see and avoid” and utilizing aircraft lighting to be  more visible in certain flight conditions. •	 During landing—conduct stabilized approaches,  maintain proper angle and desired rate of closure on  final. Use aeronautical decision-making (ADM) to  demonstrate good judgment for go-arounds, wake  turbulence avoidance, traffic, and terrain avoidance.  •	 Always—remember that safety is paramount.  

Flight instructors have the responsibility of producing the  safest pilots possible. For that reason, CFIs should tirelessly  encourage each student to learn as much as he or she is capable  of and keep raising the bar toward the ultimate goal. When  introducing lesson tasks, flight instructors should introduce  the student to the Practical Test Standards (PTS) and discuss  that the minimum acceptable standards for passing a given  maneuver are stated therein. The CFI must stress to the student  that these are only the minimum standards and that he or she  should strive for much higher performance.  

The PTS is not a teaching tool. It is a testing tool. The overall  focus of flight training should be on learning, which includes  gaining an understanding of why the standards exist and how  they were determined.  [Figure 1-2]  Use the PTS as a training  aid. Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  does require specific training for the PTS endorsements, but  this should not be presented to the student at the end of the  training. The CFI should take into consideration all of the

Figure 1-2.   Practical Test Standards.  

necessary training and strategically plan that training so the  student has time to practice and prepare. It is the ultimate goal  of the CFI to produce the safest, most competent pilot from his  or her course of instruction and take pride in knowing that the  student not only passed the test standards but exceeds those  standards when conducting any and all helicopter procedures,  on the ground or in the air.  

# The Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)  

# Role  

It is imperative that a new student be introduced and become  familiar with the role of the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) in aviation. For the new student, this includes  introducing him or her to the parts and subparts of 14 CFR that  relate to flight training and pilot certification. To be included  are pertinent handbooks, the PTS, and any references the  CFI determines to be valuable to the student pilot learning  experience. For transitioning pilots, the PTS for the helicopter  is a key reference. The student should also be introduced to the  Knowledge Test Guides that can be found at www.faa.gov.  

An online session at the FAA website provides the CFI  with an opportunity to introduce the new student and/or  transitioning pilot to the many resources now available  around the clock. The site has easy-to-access handbooks,  regulations, standards, manuals, references, and even online  courses. With the advent of the Integrated Airman Certificate  and/or Rating Application (IACRA), the FAA can process  airman certification documents via the Internet, interfacing  with multiple FAA national databases to validate data  and verify specific fields. IACRA automatically ensures  applicants meet regulatory and policy requirements and  forwards the FAA Form 8710-1 application and test results  to the FAA Airmen Certification Branch.  [Figure 1-3]   While many younger students interface easily with the  Internet, a CFI trains pilots of all ages. Ensuring the student  is comfortable using the FAA’s Internet resources is part of  a good training program.

# FAA Reference Material  

The reference materials described below, as revised, can be  used by the CFI to assemble a handout for the student. An  example of such a handout can be found in Appendix A.  

•	 Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25)—provides essential knowledge for  pilots as they progress through pilot training. Useful  to beginning pilots, as well as those pursuing more  advanced certificates.  •	 Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21)—  designed as a technical manual for applicants who  are preparing for their private, commercial, or flight  instructor pilot certificates with a helicopter class  rating. The handbook contains detailed coverage of  aerodynamics, flight controls, systems, performance,  flight maneuvers, emergencies, and ADM specific to  helicopter flight, which makes it a valuable training  aid. Helicopters are rotorcraft as are gyroplanes.  

Gyroplanes and helicopters are the two classes of  aircraft in the rotorcraft category. Therefore, to  differentiate between the classes of aircraft with  different skill requirements, the FAA issues rotorcraft  helicopter ratings or rotorcraft gyroplane ratings.  

•	 Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15)—  designed for use by instrument flight instructors  and pilots preparing for instrument rating tests, this  handbook is a valuable training aid for CFIs as it  includes basic reference material for knowledge  testing and instrument flight training.  [Figure 1-4]  

![](images/a22ebeba1b3b7065226887c4082ebb8f8f4435d66887a067c750ff7487521155.jpg)  
Figure 1-4.   The Instrument Flying Handbook is one of many training  aids provided by the FAA Airman Testing Standards Branch.  

•	 Risk Management Handbook (FAA-H-8083-2)—  provides tools to help pilots determine and assess each  situation for the safest possible flight with the least  amount of risk. This handbook presents methods pilots  can use to manage the workloads associated with each  phase of flight, resulting in a safer, more enjoyable,  and less stressful experience for both themselves and  their passengers.

 •	 Advanced Avionics Handbook (FAA-H-8083-6)—  provides general aviation users with comprehensive  information on the advanced avionics equipment  available in technically advanced aircraft. 

 •	 Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)—Chapter  10 of the AIM includes items that specifically pertain  to helicopter operations. The AIM also provides the  aviation community with basic flight information and  Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures for use in the  National Air Space (NAS) of the United States. It also  contains items of interest to pilots concerning health/ medical facts, factors affecting flight safety, etc.  

•	 Airport/Facility Directory—containing information  on public and joint use airports, communications,  navigation aids, instrument landing systems, very  high frequency (VHF) omnirange navigation system  (VOR) receiver checkpoints, preferred routes,  Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS)/Weather  Service telephone numbers, Air Route Traffic Control  Center (ARTCC) frequencies, part-time surface areas,  and various other pertinent special notices essential to  air navigation, the directory is now available in digital  format at www.faa.gov.  

•	 Practical Test Standards—the Rotorcraft (Helicopter  and Gyroplane) PTS establishes the standards for pilot  certification practical tests for the rotorcraft category,  helicopter, and gyroplane classes. FAA inspectors  and designated pilot examiners (DPEs) conduct  practical tests in compliance with these standards.  Flight instructors and applicants should find these  standards helpful during training and when preparing  for the practical test. More detailed information can  be found at www.faa.gov. Refer the new student to  page 3 of the PTS which provides a list of references  used to compile the standards under which he or she is  tested. This list identifies the publications that describe  the various tasks that need to be mastered prior to the  test. While explaining the PTS, be sure to review the  Rotorcraft Practical Test Prerequisites.  

An applicant for the Rotorcraft Practical Test is required by  14 CFR part 61 to:  

1. 	 Be able to read, speak, write, and understand the  English language. (If there is a doubt, use Advisory  Circular (AC) 60-28, English Language Skill  Standards.) 2. 	 Have passed the appropriate pilot knowledge test since  the beginning of the 24th month before the month in  which the practical test is completed. 3. 	 Have satisfactorily accomplished the required training  and obtained the aeronautical experience prescribed. 4. 	 Possess a current Medical Certificate. 5. 	 Have an endorsement from an authorized instructor  certifying that the applicant has received and logged  training time within 60 days preceding the date  of application.  

6. 	 Also have an endorsement certifying that the applicant  has demonstrated satisfactory knowledge of the  subject areas in which the applicant was deficient on  the airman knowledge test.  

# Role of the Examiner  

The subject of the PTS also offers the CFI an opportunity  to discuss the role of the examiner who plays an important  role in the FAA’s mission of promoting aviation safety  by administering FAA practical tests for pilot and flight  instructor certificates and associated ratings. To satisfy  the need for pilot testing and certification services, the  FAA delegates certain of these responsibilities to private  individuals who are not FAA employees.  

Appointed in accordance with 14 CFR section 183.23,  a designated pilot examiner (DPE) is an individual who  meets the qualification requirements of the Pilot Examiner’s  Handbook, Order 8710.3, and who:  

•	 Is technically qualified. •	 Holds all pertinent category, class, and type ratings  for each aircraft related to their designation. •	 Meets requirements of 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.56,  61.57, and 61.58, as appropriate. •	 Is current and qualified to act as pilot in command  (PIC) of each aircraft for which they are authorized. •	 Maintains at least a third-class medical certificate if  required. •	 Maintains a current flight instructor certificate, if  required.  

Designated to perform specific pilot certification tasks  on behalf of the FAA, a DPE may charge a reasonable  fee. Generally, a DPE’s authority is limited to accepting  applications and conducting practical tests leading to the  issuance of specific pilot certificates and/or ratings. The  majority of FAA practical tests at the private and commercial  pilot level are administered by DPEs, following FAA  provided test standards.  

DPE candidates must have good industry reputations for  professionalism, integrity, a demonstrated willingness  to serve the public, and adhere to FAA policies and  procedures in certification matters. The FAA expects the  DPE to administer practical tests with the same degree of  professionalism, using the same methods, procedures, and  standards as an FAA aviation safety inspector (ASI).  

# Role of the Certificated Flight Instructor  (CFI)  

The FAA places full responsibility for student flight training  on the shoulders of the CFI, who is the cornerstone of aviation  safety. It is the job of the flight instructor to train the student  in all the knowledge areas and teach the skills necessary for  the student to operate safely and competently as a certificated  pilot in the NAS. The training is not limited to airmanship  skills, but includes pilot judgment and decision-making and  good operating practices.  

A pilot training program depends on the quality of the ground  and flight instruction the student receives. A competent  instructor must possess a thorough understanding of the  learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of teaching,  and the ability to communicate effectively with the student.  He or she uses a syllabus and teaching style that embodies  the “building block” method of instruction. In this method,  the student progresses from the unknown to the known via  a course of instruction laid out in such a way that each new  maneuver embodies the principles involved in the performance  of maneuvers previously learned. Thus, with the introduction  of each new subject, the student not only learns a new principle  or technique, but also broadens his or her application of those  principles or techniques previously learned.  

Insistence on correct techniques and procedures from the  beginning of training by the CFI ensures the student develops  proper habit patterns. Any deficiencies in maneuvers or  techniques must immediately be emphasized and corrected.  A CFI serves as a role model for the student who observes  the flying habits of his or her flight instructor during flight  instruction, as well as when the instructor conducts other  pilot operations. Thus, the CFI becomes a model of flying  proficiency for the student who, consciously or unconsciously,  attempts to imitate the instructor. The CFI’s advocacy and  description of safety practices mean little to a student if the  instructor does not demonstrate them consistently. For this  reason, CFIs must observe recognized safety practices, as  well as regulations during all flight operations.  

An appropriately rated CFI is responsible for training the  pilot applicant to acceptable standards in all subject matter  areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in the tasks  within the appropriate PTS. Because of the impact of their  teaching activities in developing safe, proficient pilots, flight  instructors should exhibit a high level of knowledge, skill, and  the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to students.  

Additionally, the flight instructor must certify that the  applicant is able to perform safely as a pilot and is  competent to pass the required practical test. Throughout the  applicant’s training, the CFI is responsible for emphasizing  the performance of effective visual scanning, collision  avoidance, and runway incursion avoidance procedures.  

Anyone who enrolls in a pilot training program commits  considerable time, effort, and expense to earn a pilot  certificate. Many times an individual judges the effectiveness  of the flight instructor and the success of the pilot training  program based on his or her ability to pass the requisite FAA  practical test. A truly professional flight instructor stresses to  the student that practical tests are a sampling of pilot ability  compressed into a short period of time. The goal of a CFI is  to train the “total” pilot.  

# Flight Safety Practices  

A major component of the FAA’s mission is to improve  the nation’s aviation safety record by conveying safety  principles and practices through training, outreach, and  education. The goal to reduce the number of accidents in  the ever increasingly populated airways means safe flight  practices are an important element of flight instruction. It is  the CFI’s responsibility to incorporate flight safety into the  program of training.  

Do not become complacent about safety while instructing.  The CFI must always be vigilant about safety and must instill  a safety-first attitude in the student. According to statistics  from Helicopter Association International’s (HAI) Five-Year  Comparative U.S. Civil Helicopter Safety Trends, the ratio  of instructional/training-related accidents to total accidents in  the United States has increased more than 18 percent between  January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2006. Interestingly  enough though, the total number of helicopter flight hours has  increased by 37 percent, while the accident rate per 100,000  flight hours has drastically decreased—by 42 percent in the  same time period. The entire U.S. Civil Helicopter Safety  Statistic - Summary Report can be found at www.rotor.com.  

Accidents happen quickly during flight instruction, as  this recent National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  accident report reveals:  

During a training flight, a helicopter collided with terrain.  Weather was visual flight rules (VFR) with no flight plan filed.  This was the CFI’s first instructional flight with this student.  They conducted the preflight inspection of the helicopter  together, started up, and departed for the practice area.  

Once the student had a general understanding of the controls,  they did an approach that terminated in a hover. The CFI  set up the helicopter for a slight right quartering headwind  to compensate for translating tendencies, then allowed  the student to manipulate the controls. During hover, the  helicopter exhibited pendulum action that is common for  new students learning to hover. During one of the right lateral  oscillations, the helicopter unexpectedly lost altitude. The  right skid contacted the ground, and the helicopter rolled  over onto its right side. Within seconds, it ignited. Both pilots  exited immediately.  

Since the helicopter and engine had no mechanical failures  or malfunctions during the flight, the accident might have  been prevented by:  

•	 Maintaining a proper skid height during instruction at  all times. •	 Stopping the lateral and aft movement sooner.  •	 Restricting hovering flight to later lessons after the  student has gained some insight and appreciation  of the control responsiveness and sensitivity of the  helicopter.  

The CFI also should have stayed on the controls longer to  give the student more time to become familiar with them.  The CFI violated the building block principle of simple  to complex. The student had no experience to build upon.  Helicopter students learn best by beginning in the air where  there is a greater margin of error and then learning to fly  closer to the ground.  

Accident data at the NTSB offer CFIs excellent scenario  material for safety discussions. Updated daily and located at  www.ntsb.gov, descriptions of more than 140,000 aviation  accidents can be searched by a variety of factors, such as  date or aircraft category.  

# Helicopter Hazards  

During the entire training program, CFIs should emphasize  safe operation of the aircraft. The student must be introduced  to and completely understand the flight characteristics of the  type helicopter being flown. Loss of tail rotor effectiveness  (LTE), dynamic rollover (DRO), and the meaning of and  how to interpret the height velocity diagram are three topics  of discussion for continuous review. By virtue of its many  moving parts, the helicopter presents numerous hazards.  [Figure 1-5]  It is the responsibility of the CFI to teach safe  operating practices in and around the aircraft.  

A CFI should draw to the attention of the student the hazards  that include, but are not limited to the following:  

•	 For single rotor helicopters, students should be taught  from the beginning that it is preferred to approach  

# SAFETY  AROUND HELICOPTERS  

Approaching or Leaving a Helicopter  

Do not approach or leave without the pilot’s visual acknowledgement. Keep in pilot’s field of vision  at all times Observe helicopter safety zones  (see diagram at right).  

![](images/761bce6f1e4c23c0593afa4e398a7d65c719cf455ef87ddf945207717239d509.jpg)  

On sloping ground, always approach or leave on the  downslope side for maximum rotor clearance.  

If blinded by swirling dust or grit,  STOP —crouch lower, or sit down and await assistance.  

![](images/9712ac6d1dd5c2eb91af21e26ce7c8d04dabffa96b5c98e0c3e52585d5da6835.jpg)  

If disembarking while helicopter is at the hover, get out and  off in a smooth unhurried manner.  

![](images/0cb7c69b43a9d98ba722c115c0b6eb530e8390ff0eb6fda714fbff76a3d52e6b.jpg)  

Do not approach or leave a helicopter when the engine and rotors are running down or starting up.\*  

Proceed in a crouching manner for extra rotor clearance. Hold onto hat unless chin straps are used.  Never , reach  up or chase after a hat or other articles that blow away.  

Carry tools, etc., horizontally below waist level—never upright or on the shoulder.  

\* It is common in some operations to leave a running helicopter to refuel or load passengers or cargo. If doing so, the controls must 

   be frictioned down to prevent movement from the selected position and usually, the engine is brought back to the idle setting. The 

   pilot must be extremely carfeul in exiting and entering the cockpit so as to not move the controls. The pilot should ensure that their

   headset is unplugged or properly stowed so as to remain clear of the flight controls. Seatbelts and doors should not be left flapping 

   in the rotor wash. and exit the helicopter from the sides but that the  forward quarter is acceptable. If approaching or  exiting a helicopter that is on a slope, always exit on  the downward side to avoid contact with the rotor  blades. Limited access to the near aft portion of the  fuselage is acceptable for some helicopters, such as  the BO-105 and BK-117, in which the tail rotor has  been elevated and loading is in the rear of the fuselage.  CFIs should advise students to always consult with  the pilot or trained personnel before going aft of the  cockpit doors. This instills in the students the preferred  direction to enter and exit the rotor disk area so the  pilot can maintain eye contact with personnel around  the aircraft. During preflight, the CFI should teach  students to do a proper walk-around before moving  any control surfaces to ensure that nothing is in the  way of the main or tail rotor blades.  

•	 Always avoid the tail rotor by approaching from the  sides. The rotor disk should be tipped so the students  understand just how low the main rotor blades may  dip in winds and as a result of exaggerated control  movements.

 •	 Hands and fingers can be pinched by rotor hubs and  hinges during preflight and postflight inspections.

 •	 Main and tail rotor blades pose significant hazards  for those unaccustomed to being around helicopters  during ground operations.

 •	 Any moving blade is dangerous and can cause injury  or damage while under power or during the start up  and coast down periods after engine power has been  removed. 

 •	 Wind or a control input can easily cause slow moving  blades to droop or flex, reducing clearance for people  standing underneath the rotor disk. 

 •	 If the helicopter must be moved from the hangar,  students should be cautioned on the hazards of having  a piece of machinery raised off the surface and the  correct methods of raising and lowering the aircraft.  Since helicopters may be taller than an equal size  airplane; the student should be taught to ensure plenty  of vertical clearance for the aircraft as it is moved. Trip  hazards, such as ground wires, should be explained as to  requirements, storage, and attachment at end of flights.

 •	 The movement of the helicopter for flight should  include preplanning to prevent the hangar from filling  with grass, dirt, and excessive wind in the facility. The  direction of the wind and airflow around the building  should be considered before selecting a takeoff point  for the helicopter.

 •	 Jewelry, especially rings, should be removed before  preflight and postflight to ensure that they will not  be caught on any fasteners or sharp objects. Loose  clothing should be secured, and objects in pockets  should be removed if the pockets cannot be fastened.  

In hover flight, the CFI should emphasize the hazards that  rotor wash presents to persons or light aircraft nearby. Dust  and debris cause eye injuries and vortices damage light  aircraft. A tail rotor is another source of significant hazard  because it is out of sight of the pilot. Instructors should ensure  the student is aware of the requirement to keep the tail rotor  area cleared. Hazards such as those listed above are but a few  of the hazards unique to the helicopter. The observant CFI  identifies potential hazards during the lesson, corrects the  deficiency immediately with an explanation, and develops  them as teaching points.  

# Instructional Hazards  

Flying a helicopter offers a different set of physical and  mental challenges for a student. The stress of learning how  to fly is coupled with the physical demands of flying the  helicopter. The constant vibration of the aircraft, as well  as the continually need to make control inputs to “fly”  the aircraft, make helicopter flight a more physically and  mentally strenuous type of flying. The vibration, noise, and  stress can lead to fatigue, which can have a detrimental effect  upon the ability of the student not only to fly a helicopter but  to absorb instruction. To combat this hazard, limit the length  of the lesson to less than an hour until the student becomes  accustomed to the demands of this type of flying. For further  discussion of medical factors associated with flying, refer to  the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  

As shown in  Figure 1-6,  the CFI must remain vigilant  when the student has control of the helicopter because the  student’s knee may get in the way of the cyclic movement.  The student’s size cannot be changed, but it is the CFI’s  responsibility to teach the student to be aware of how their  size may affect the flight controls input.  

The instructor should always ensure that all of the flight  controls are unencumbered. Students are so focused on  the task at hand when learning to fly and often times will  unknowingly obstruct the flight controls. For example,  water bottles, clothing and cameras can get stuck under the  collective levers preventing movement, or anti-torque pedals  can get blocked from movement by the students boot or shoe.  

Another potential instructional hazard stems from the ability  of helicopter rotor blades to strike the terrain or objects in  a  $360^{\circ}$   arc. This unique capability of the helicopter must be  stressed when teaching a student who is transitioning from  fixed-wing aircraft. A fixed-wing pilot is accustomed only  to the idea that one wing will hit if the aircraft is banked too  

![](images/0c06f33665a71e3559bd75f5451b3ab9fdb24f630de682ca491fc8d963bf9b02.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.   Robinson Helicopter R-22.  

far. If teaching someone who is transitioning from airplanes,  the CFI needs to stress to the student the speed of the rotor  and its close proximity to the ground.  

# Collision Avoidance  

While pilots often believe that having a CFI on board  minimizes the possibility of a midair collision (MAC),  FAA research reveals that flight instructors were on  board the aircraft in 37 percent of the accidents studied.  From a collision perspective, flight training is one of the  most dangerous missions—an especially frightening fact,  considering that flight instructors comprise less than 10  percent of the pilot population.  

# See and Avoid  

As discussed in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, the CFI  must ensure from the start of flight training that the student  develops the habit of maintaining airspace surveillance at  all times.  [Figure 1-7]  If a student believes the instructor  assumes all responsibility for scanning and collision  avoidance procedures, he or she will not develop the habit  of maintaining the constant vigilance essential to safety.  Establish scan areas and communication practices for keeping  the aircraft cleared as outlined in the AIM, paragraphs  4-4-15 and 8-8-6c. For example, “Clear left? Cleared left.  Turning left.” should be verbalized in conjunction with  the actual scanning. In addition to clearing left and right,  a helicopter pilot must also clear directly above and below  since the helicopter has the ability of climbing and descending  

![](images/66a68f7165beca04215cd7c4feca51a671dd395ce809146d412dd53460c9aa70.jpg)  
Figure 1-7.   Collision avoidance, both in the air and on the ground, is one of the most basic responsibilities of a pilot flying in visual  conditions.  

vertically. This ability has resulted in helicopters climbing  directly into overhead hangar doors and power lines. Any  observed tendency of a student to enter flight maneuvers  without first making a careful check for other air traffic must  be corrected immediately. In addition to the statistic quoted  above, recent studies of midair collisions determined that:  

•	 Most of the aircraft involved in collisions are engaged  in recreational flying, and not on any type of flight plan. •	 Most midair collisions occur in VFR weather  conditions during weekend daylight hours. •	 The vast majority of accidents occurred at or near  nontowered airports and at altitudes below 1,000 feet. •	 Pilots of all experience levels were involved in midair  collisions, from pilots on their first solo ride to 20,000- hour veterans. •	 Most collisions occur in daylight with visibility greater  than three miles.  

It is imperative to introduce 14 CFR section 91.113, Right- of-Way Rules: Except Water Operations,” for the “see and  avoid” concept immediately to the student. Practice the “see  and avoid” concept at all times regardless of whether the  training is conducted under VFR or instrument flight rules  (IFR). A CFI and student can review the FAA’s suggestions  for how to contribute to professional flying and reduce the  odds of being involved in a midair collision, at www.faa.gov. Other references that contain collision avoidance information  for both the CFI and student are AC 90-48, Pilot’s Role in  Collision Avoidance; FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge; and the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM) (all as revised) located online at www.faa.gov.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

Incident/accident statistics indicate a need to place additional  emphasis on the exchange of control of an aircraft by  pilots. Numerous accidents have occurred due to a lack of  communication or misunderstanding as to who actually had  control of the aircraft, particularly between students and  flight instructors. Establishing the following procedure during  initial training ensures the formation of a habit pattern that  should stay with students throughout their flying careers.  They are more likely to relinquish control willingly and  promptly when instructed to do so during flight training.  

During flight training, there must always be a clear  understanding between the student and the flight instructor  of who has control of the aircraft.  [Figure 1-8]  Prior to flight,  a briefing should be conducted that includes the procedure  for the exchange of flight controls. A positive three-step  process in the exchange of flight controls between pilots is  

![](images/a2678b23b2fc45de3cb4ea30ede9bda546a5d6c4b8aff08f4fc727b9e3296af1.jpg)  
Figure 1-8.   There should never been any doubt about who is flying  the helicopter.  

a proven procedure and one that is strongly recommended.  During this procedure, a visual check is recommended to see  that the other person actually has the flight controls. When  returning the controls to the instructor, the student should  follow the same procedure the instructor used when giving  control to the student.   There should never be any doubt as  to who is flying the aircraft.  

CFIs should always guard the controls and be prepared to take  control of the aircraft. When necessary, the instructor should  take the controls and calmly announce, “I have the flight  controls.” If an instructor allows a student to remain on the  controls, the instructor may not have full and effective control  of the aircraft. Anxious students can be incredibly strong and  usually exhibit reactions inappropriate to the situation. If a  recovery is necessary, there is absolutely nothing to be gained  by having the student on the controls and needing to fight for  control of the aircraft. Students should never be allowed to  exceed the flight instructor’s limits. Flight instructors should  not exceed their own ability to perceive a problem, decide  upon a course of action, and physically react within their  ability to fly the aircraft.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management  (SRM)  

According to data presented at the 2005 International  Helicopter Safety Symposium, the helicopter accident rate  is 30 percent higher than the general aviation (GA) accident  rate. Reducing this rate is an industry wide goal and the CFI  plays an important role in reaching it by stressing single-pilot  resource management (SRM) and risk management during  flight training.  

As discussed in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook and the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, SRM is the  art and science of managing all resources (both onboard the  aircraft and from outside sources) available to a single pilot  (prior and during flight) to ensure the successful outcome  of the flight. SRM grew out of the airline industry’s crew  resource management (CRM) training for flight crews that  was launched in an effort to reduce human factors-related  aircraft accidents. SRM is the effective use of all available  resources: human, hardware, and information to ensure a safe  flight. The CFI must keep in mind that SRM is not a single  task; it is a set of skill competencies that must be evident in  all tasks. Aviation resource management charges the flight  instructor with the responsibility of teaching the student a  safety mindset that enhances his or her decision-making skills.  

SRM depends upon teaching the student higher order thinking  skills (HOTS) as discussed in Chapter 2 of the Aviation  Instructor’s Handbook. HOTS are taught from simple to  complex and from concrete to abstract. To teach HOTS  effectively involves strategies and methods that include:  

• 	 Using problem-based learning (PBL) instruction,  •	 Authentic problems, •	 Student-centered learning, •	 Active learning, •	 Cooperative learning, and •	 Customized instruction to meet the individual learner’s  needs.  

These strategies engage the student in some form of mental  activity, have the student examine that mental activity and  select the best solution, and challenge the student to explore  other ways to accomplish the task or the problem.  

Student understanding of risk management and judgment  is enhanced when the instructor includes the student in all  preflight practices and procedures, as the instructor shares  the logic behind decisions whether to fly or not to fly. If the  instructor uses the performance charts every time before  flying to ensure sufficient power, control authority, and lift  is available, then the student will probably acquire that habit.  If the instructor always prompts the student to call for a  weather, NOTAMS, and TFR briefing, then the student will  learn proper preflight planning techniques. If the instructor  determines what the student wants to be able to do with the  helicopter, then the instructor can makes plans to ensure  that the hazards inherent to those operations are covered  completely and emphasized during training.  

# Risk Management  

The FAA is committed to reducing the number of helicopter  accidents and promoting risk management as an important  component of flight training. The objective of risk  management is to provide a proper balance between risk and  opportunity. Two elements define risk management: hazard  and risk. Hazard is a real or perceived condition, event, or  circumstance that a pilot encounters. Risk is how the pilot  views the potential impact of the hazard.  

Risk management is the method used to control, eliminate,  or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level. The individual  pilot is unique to risk management. An acceptable level of  risk to one pilot may not necessarily be the same to another  pilot. Unfortunately in many cases, the pilot perceives that  his or her level of risk acceptability is actually greater than  their capability, thereby taking on risk that is dangerous.  

For example, prior to entering a helicopter, the CFI must  establish his or her own limitations. How far is the CFI  willing to allow the student to drift during a hover? Once  personal limitations are established, the CFI must fly within  them. The CFI should always ensure that the helicopter is  never allowed to depart the instructor’s comfort zone and  maneuvering limitations. In reality, the instructor is observing  the maneuvering of the helicopter and monitoring the control  movements by sight or feel. The helicopter instructor has  to be very familiar with that particular helicopter and it’s  responses to control inputs and winds, especially at a hover  with a wing with an airspeed of  $^{400+}$   knots flying while at  3 feet landing gear height above the surface. A split second  delay in correcting an errant control input can be disastrous.  

References and resources for risk management include:  

•	 Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  FAA-H-8083-25  •	 Pilot risk management brochures located at www.faa. gov (brochures include tips for teaching practical risk  management)  [Figure 1-9] •	 Risk Management Handbook, FAA-H-8083-2  

Since the DPE evaluates the applicant’s ability to use good  ADM procedures in order to evaluate risks throughout  the practical test, it is important the CFI incorporates risk  management into the flight lessons as soon as possible. The  scenarios should be realistic and within the capabilities of  the helicopter used for the practical test.  

To teach risk management, CFIs must understand system  safety flight training occurs in three phases. First, there  are the traditional aircraft control maneuvers. In order to  apply critical thinking skills, the student must first have a  high degree of confidence in their ability to fly the aircraft.  Basic airmanship skill is the priority during this phase of  flight training. The CFI accepts the responsibility of risk  management until the student is able to accept more tasking.

Figure 1-9.   Brochure available from the FAA website for teaching practical risk management.  

In the second phase, the CFI teaches the student how  to identify hazards, manage risk, and use all available  resources to make each flight as safe as possible. This can  be accomplished through scenarios that emphasize the skill  sets being taught. For example, the CFI could inform the  student that they were going to do some photography in  the mountains for a survey. The instructor could give the  student two temperatures and one elevation for the areas.  Then, the instructor would assist the student in reviewing  the performance charts for the two temperatures and  have the student determine the differences in helicopter  performance with those temperatures and how to determine  any maneuvering restrictions from those temperatures.  “Does the lack of OGE hover restrict anything?” could be  one question. Then hopefully, the CFI and student would fly  up to some point for the student to have a safe and real-life  experience of the difference in aircraft performance in higher  temperatures and higher density altitudes.  

In the third phase, as the student is completing the course of  training, the instructor should begin exposing the student to  practical scenarios of helicopter flight and enable the student  to discern the hazards associated with each profile. Using  the “simple to complex” method at all times, the student is  introduced to scenarios demanding focus on several safety- of-flight issues.  [Figure 1-10]  

The CFI must present the subject of risk management as it  relates to helicopter operations for the level of instruction  being presented. For example, a new helicopter student  has different requirements from those of a prospective  commercial Emergency Medical Services (EMS) pilot.

# Training Procedures  

The introduction to training procedures offers the certificated  flight instructor (CFI) an opportunity to better ascertain  the student’s experience and background, which influence  training. At this time, the CFI explains the general safety  procedures, lay out of the school, the course syllabus and how  it is used. This includes how, when, and where instruction  will take place. The CFI also discusses the role of preflight  and postflight briefings in the training program, as well as  how he or she monitors the student’s progress. Additionally,  the introduction to training should be used to determine the  student’s motivation for flight training and learn what their  goals are. By understanding what the student would like to  gain through flight training, the CFI will be better prepared  to tailor their training plan to the needs of the student.  

# Introduction to the Helicopter  

Walking the student through a preflight provides an excellent  opportunity to introduce or review the main components  of the helicopter.  [Figure 2-1]  Refer the student to the  Helicopter Flying Handbook for in-depth information on  the rotor systems, landing gear, and flight controls. During  the discussion, the CFI should demonstrate how to enter and  exit the helicopter properly while the rotors are turning. This  is also a good time to explain or review:  

•	 General helicopter hazards, such as main and tail rotor  blades. A simple demonstration of how low main rotor  blades can droop is possible by manually pulling down  on the tip of a static blade. In aircraft equipped with  retractable droop stops, the CFI must explain that  actual droop can be greater once the stops retract with  greater rotor revolutions per minute (rpm). Ensure that  all demonstrations comply with restrictions found in  the appropriate rotorcraft flight manual.  

![](images/7b91b84d54f600f51d2dd4fe118ca342550db2f4a11979e354a6af678b6ab8d4.jpg)  
Figure 2-1.   A CFI provides an overview of the helicopter to  introduce the main components and discuss how to enter and exit  a helicopter properly.  

•	 Emergency egress.

 •	 Foreign object damage (FOD) hazards associated with  items, such as hats, jackets, and loose paperwork.  

•	 Seat belt use at all times during flight.  

• 	 Proper wear and use of the headset.  

• 	 Proper sitting posture and position of the hands and  feet.  

•	 Positive exchange of controls procedures and  acknowledgments.  

•	 The see-and-avoid concept.  

•	 The clock method of reporting aircraft and other  hazards to flight to the other crewmember.  

•	 The need for clothing suitable for the location and  weather. It is always good practice to have sufficient  clothing for walking back to the starting point.  Helicopters can readily take a pilot far beyond  populated areas. The pilot should always have enough  resources to survive or to wait for a repair crew to  arrive, in case of emergency. (Please refer to Chapter  12, Helicopter Emergencies.)  

• 	 Suitable eye protection, such as good sunglasses  to protect the eyes from harmful rays that produce  cataracts in later years. Helicopters admit much  more sunlight than almost any other aircraft, due  to the bigger bubble or cockpit plexiglas area and  chin window areas. Additionally, many helicopters  fly with the doors off in warmer climates, thereby  exposing the student’s eyes to much more radiation.  

• 	 Seat and pedal adjustment in the helicopter to achieve  full control travel.  

• 	 Headset and commonly used noise-canceling  microphone function, so that the headset and  microphone can be properly fitted and adjusted. The  student should know how to adjust the volume of  the headset and be able to understand the instructor  and radios through the headset. If a voice-activated  intercom is installed, the student should be taught  what the squelch control function does and how  to adjust it when necessary. Headsets not utilized  should be disconnected and stowed away to prevent  unwanted noise and reduce the risk of FOD. Also,  loose items such as seatbelts, bags, jackets, hats, and  flight publications should be stowed.  

• 	 Controls and buttons located on the cyclic and  collective. Most of this preflight instruction should  be done in as quiet a location as possible before  engine start. After engine start, student perceptions  will probably be overloaded quickly with new  experiences and sensations from their first helicopter  flight. Effective instruction would have the ground  instructor bringing the class out to the helicopter  after every lesson to have them locate, examine, and  describe the function of each part described in that  lesson. The students should be able to explain the  relationship between a component of the helicopter  and the aerodynamics requiring that component.  

The importance of good prebriefings can never be overstated.  In almost every case, if the student does not learn from  the briefing what is expected and the contents of the flight  lesson for that day before going to the helicopter, then that  student will not learn after getting into and starting the  helicopter. Instructors forget that the new student pilot is  constantly barraged by new information. Newly experiencing  the sights, sounds, vibrations, and other sensory inputs of  helicopter flight, the beginning student has great difficulty  understanding and remembering what the instructor says.  If the instructor merely reinforces what the student learned  in the classroom, the student is more likely to recall the  instructions and procedures for the maneuvers amid the new  experiences.  

Likewise, during the prebriefing, the student should be  introduced to the flying area. The time required for a review  of the chart to be used depends on the experience level of the  student and when charts and maps were taught during the  training. The instructor should also remember that the student  may not remember as well if the student is always on the flight  controls. The instructor may need to relieve the student of the  flight controls for a few moments near each boundary marker  or checkpoint for the student to have time to fully absorb the  view and relate the sight to the chart or map being used.  

If the student has airplane experience, the instructor should  be aware of negative transfer of airplane skills to helicopter  flying. The first flight should set the stage for the remainder  of the flight course. A shorter flight is always better than a  long flight. If the student becomes warm or hot, the likelihood  of airsickness is greater. Some students have an aversion  to heights, which can be overcome by determination and  gradual exposure.  

The instructor has the duty always to give the student  just enough—just enough encouragement, or just enough  challenge for that stage of training, or just enough critique— for the student to learn but not to discourage. The instructor  should always have enough understanding of the student’s  progress to discuss the student’s problems and explain how  or why the error is occurring and what corrective or different  action to take to have a better outcome. Especially on the  ground, the instructor should always strive for the student  to comprehend, not just remember and perform by rote  memorization.  

# Introduction to Flying  

For the first flight, the instructor should give the student just  enough flight experience to make the student want to come  back for more. During the first flight, the CFI should allow the  student to fly the aircraft and have fun doing it. An enjoyable  introductory flight builds student motivation and the student  will be more ready to learn. Solo flight comes after more  flight experience, so there is plenty of time for the student  to learn local landmarks.  [Figure 2-2]  This flight should be  an introduction to flying itself and should follow the pattern  of learning simple tasks before more complex tasks. The  student should learn to fly first, and then learn where to fly.  

![](images/2b4a73540061b16500136ebb6f622ace4e74ed0f360c986919321bfd0d73464e.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.   During an introductory flight, a student pilot receives  the first helicopter flight experience while being shown the general  functions of the controls and instruments and is also introduced to  the local landmarks and the layout of the airfield.  

The CFI must show the student that flying can be fun, and  then introduce the student to the local flying area. During this  flight, seat the student at the pilot’s seat. (Seat the new student  at the copilot’s seat for the first few flights if access to engine  starting or flight control friction is not easily accessible from  the copilot’s seat.) Explain the general function of the controls  and instruments. Demonstrate adjustment of the controls  for comfort and safety, as applicable to the make and model  of helicopter being flown. Relate this flight to the student’s  flying background and level of experience. For example, a  new student’s introductory flight can also be used to discuss  basic air traffic control (ATC) functions and procedures.  

A brief “hands on” for the student during cruising flight  helps the CFI further evaluate the student’s level of ability.  If at all possible, the first flight or at least the first portion of  the first flight should be conducted in a calmer environment,  such as in the morning or at a higher altitude, so the student  has a chance to experience the helicopter flight without the  turbulence that is often confusing to the student.  

This flight also provides the CFI with an opportunity to  evaluate the student’s attitude, tolerance, and temperament.  The student should enjoy this first trip, creating a positive  foundation for the rest of the course. Explain that procedures  that seem complicated at this time become easier with more  exposure and training.  

Try to avoid confusing the student by presenting too much  detailed information at this early stage in training. As  discussed in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, students  tend to acquire and memorize facts when exposed to a new  topic. As learning progresses, they begin to organize their  knowledge to formulate an understanding of the things they  have memorized. Progressing further still, students learn to  use the knowledge they have compiled to solve problems  and make decisions. Encourage and praise such behavior  whenever students exhibit the pilot in command (PIC)  input. Keep in mind that student performance should not be  criticized or corrected at this stage; explain in general terms  what occurs during flight to clarify student’s understanding.  

In the early stages of flight training, the traditional lesson  plan (see the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook) provides  the CFI with a teaching delivery method more in tune with  the student’s level of knowledge. Scenario-based training  (SBT) works better with learners who have mastered the  basic knowledge needed to make more advanced decisions.  The samples used in the early chapters utilize the traditional  lesson plan.  

The most important lesson for helicopter pilots to learn is to  be wary. As training progresses, the instructor can incorporate  discussions of documented helicopter accidents related to the  lesson of the day. The instructor can offer techniques and  procedures that would prevent that type of incident from  happening. While it is important to relate some of these  stories to student pilots, the instructor should avoid too many  accident discussions early in the training as they may instill  fear in students that may not understand the details. Respect  for the dangers in aviation can aid a student’s progression,  but fear acts as a barrier to learning.  

Instructors in the debriefing after the flight should always  discuss what was satisfactory and then discuss what  improvements the student could make and, even more  important, how to make improvements. It does not help the  student to say the flight was unsatisfactory that day if the  instructor cannot describe in detail how the student could  correct any responses or maneuvers.  

After the debriefing, most successful instructors begin to  brief the student on the contents of the next day’s training  flight. This allows:  

1. 	 The student time between flights to study and think  about the next maneuver to learn at their own pace. 2. 	 The student to recall questions from the current flight  about a specific point during the flight. 3. 	 The student to formulate questions concerning  practices or procedures for the instructor to address  before the next flight. 4. 	 The instructor to relate the current flight to the  upcoming flight’s goals and maneuvers to further  the student’s understanding of the relationship of the  procedures.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 For the airplane pilot transitioning to helicopters,  remind the student that a helicopter is very different  from an airplane and much negative transfer is possible  if they do not continually remind themselves of which  aircraft that they are flying at the time. Helicopters  are designed and built to be controllable. Airplanes  are designed and built to be stable. Helicopter flight  controls are considerably more sensitive than those  in an airplane, which can be difficult for a former  airplane pilot to adjust to. CFI’s must also explain  the aerodynamic effects that must be controlled by  the helicopter pilot due to the main rotors’ blade tip  speed.  [Figure 2-3]  The Helicopter Flying Handbook  is a good reference for detailed explanations on the  calculations of the main rotors’ blade tip speeds and  the magnitude of the aerodynamic effects that must  be controlled by the helicopter pilot.  

•	 Avoid sudden or violent maneuvers that might make  a newcomer to flying nervous. Emphasize how little  movement is required on the cyclic and collective  controls. This is critical for prior airplane pilots and  can be demonstrated by calculating and explaining  the blade tip speed to emphasize the magnitude of the  aerodynamic effects controlled by a helicopter pilot.  Introduce the pedal requirement immediately with  short quick inputs rather than slow and long inputs.  Demonstrate and point out to the student which part  of the body should be used and are necessary in order  to achieve the proper input.  

• 	 Monitor the student pilot’s hand grip pressure on  the flight controls, foot position on the pedals, body  posture, and eyes regularly for clues of nervousness,  lack of progress, improper reaction to the situation,  and situational unawareness.

•	 Always practice positive transfer of control procedures  and acknowledgments. This is particularly important  in the early stages of training to instill good habits  and safety when either the student or the CFI is on  the controls for a long period of time. • 	 Helicopters are not acrobatic in the general sense.  Therefore, positive “G” loads are the normal condition.  All good helicopter pilots are smooth flyers because  they know smooth flight is good for the machine and  passengers/cargo. • 	 Sudden or violent maneuvering is usually the precursor  for main rotor or tail rotor strikes. The helicopter pilot  should always be planning the flight path to avoid  close, tight situations requiring rapid maneuvering.  

The helicopter instructor should be relating the ongoing  training to student plans for after they earn their certificates.  This encourages learning and help students relate the training  to a positive personal goal.  

The goals of the first flight should be for the student to  recognize flight attitude of the helicopter relative to the  horizon and to relate the control inputs necessary to achieve  changes in the aircraft’s attitude. On the first flight, acquaint  the student with the basic flight instruments, such as the rotor  tachometer, engine tachometer, compass, airspeed indicator,  altimeter, and power gauge (manifold pressure or torque).  Additionally, show the student how the helicopter responds  to pedal inputs at a hover versus in forward flight, and how  the power changes depending on tail rotor power demands.  

The first helicopter flight should be rewarding, and not  overwhelming or boring. If possible, one day should be the  detailed preflight and prebriefing and the next the regular  preflight and actual first flight.  

Another item to include on the first flight is the engine cooling  time, including the reasons the student sees airplanes come  to a full stop and kill the engines immediately, while the  helicopter pilot must sit for some minutes before the engine  can be shut down. Explain that a helicopter requires relatively  more power to hover taxi than an airplane requires to ground  taxi. Helicopters require more of their available power to  hover so the powerplant is relatively hotter and requires a  longer cool-down period. Generally, airplane engines begin  to cool during descent to landing and require little or no time  to cool down after landing.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provided the CFI with the objectives of an  introductory flight. It also set the stage for the future training  sessions, leading to the development of a competent, safety  conscious, and cordial pilot.  

# Chapter 3 Aerodynamics of Flight  

# Introduction  

All helicopter pilots must have a basic knowledge of the  aerodynamic principles that enable helicopter flight. While  the principles that apply to a helicopter are the same as those  that apply to other aircraft, the application of these principles  is more complex due to the rotating airfoils. Chapters 2 and  3 of the Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21) and  Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook (FAA-H-8083-1),  form the foundation for this chapter.  

As with any training, begin the presentation of new material at  the student’s level of understanding. This can be determined  throughout the introductory meeting with the student simply  by engaging conversation about helicopters and general  flight. Any previous flight experience will be apparent during  preflight and while flying. Written or oral testing on the first  day of flight school could deter a student from further flight  training. A proficient, certificated flight instructor (CFI)  should be able to determine the background and expertise of  a student by careful use of the initial introductory meeting.  

The student’s aviation background determines when to  introduce different aspects of aerodynamics. The student must  have the appropriate background knowledge to comprehend  the subject matter. Periodic reviews during the course of  instruction help the instructor tailor the lesson to the student’s  comprehension and arrange the material to fit the student’s  needs. Define new terms when first introduced.  

The overall objective of this chapter is to help the instructor  review the aerodynamics found in the Helicopter Flying  Handbook (FAA- 8083-21, as revised) and help the student  understand how those effects practically affect their  helicopter flight. In order to control a helicopter in flight,  the student must have the consistent ability to identify and  compensate for varying aerodynamic forces in flight.  

# Forces Acting on the Aircraft  

Define and discuss the four forces acting on an aircraft in  straight-and-level and unaccelerated flight. Give examples of  how the combinations of these forces act on the airframe.  

1.	 Thrust—the forward force produced by a powerplant/ propeller or rotor. It opposes or overcomes the force  of drag.   2.	 Drag—a rearward, retarding force caused by  disruption of airflow by the wing, rotor, fuselage, and  other protruding objects. Drag opposes thrust and acts  rearward parallel to the relative wind. 3.	 Weight—the combined load of the aircraft itself, the  crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. The earth’s  gravitational force, which creates the weight, pulls the  aircraft downward.  4.	 Lift—overcomes the downward force of weight to  allow flight to occur and is produced by the dynamic  effect of the air acting on the airfoil and acts vertically  through the center of gravity.  

# Lift  

A very easy way to confuse new flight students is to throw a  lot of obscure information at them with no concrete references  or examples.  Aerodynamics can be very difficult for the new  student to understand because it is difficult to visualize what  is happening to the rotor blades or tail rotor in flight.  When  teaching the student about lift and how the helicopter is able  to obtain lift, the instructor must be creative and find ways  to explain the theories, such as Bernoulli’s Principle and  Newton’s Laws of Motion, in direct relation to the helicopter  and how every flight control movement affects lift.  

# Bernoulli’s Principle  

Instructors should introduce Bernoulli’s Principle to the  student in simple terms and attempt to relate the theory  directly to the production of lift that is created from the  main and tail rotor blades. The discussion should begin with  Bernoulli’s initial discovery that air moving over a surface  decreases air pressure on the surface, and show the student  an example of the differences in air pressure when an object  moves through the air. Further discussion should include the  following points and examples:  

1.	 Show the student a picture of an airfoil and how the  air pressure changes when the air is disrupted. A  picture of an airfoil is usually a small cutout or slice  of the entire wing or rotor blade. The instructor should  explain that the entire rotor blade(s) are essentially one  large airfoil. 2.	 As airspeed increases, surface air pressure decreases  accordingly and this difference in pressure around the  airfoil is directly related to the flight of an aircraft.  3.	 As an airfoil starts moving through the air, it divides the  mass of air molecules at its leading edge. The distance  over the top of the blade with the angle of attack is  greater than the distance along the bottom surface of  the rotor blade. Air molecules that pass over the top  must move faster than those passing under the bottom  to meet at the same time along the trailing edge. The  faster airflow across the top surface creates a low- pressure area above the airfoil.  4.	 Air pressure below the airfoil is greater than the pressure  above it and tends to push the airfoil up into the area of  lower pressure. As long as air passes over the airfoil,  this condition exists. It is the difference in pressure that  causes lift. When air movement is fast enough over  a wing or rotor blade, the lift produced matches the  weight of the airfoil and its attached parts. This lift is  able to support the entire aircraft. As airspeed across  the wing or rotor increases further, the lift exceeds the  weight of the aircraft and the aircraft rises.  5.	 Not all of the air met by an airfoil is used in lift. Some  of it creates resistance, or drag, which hinders forward  motion. Lift and drag increase and decrease together.  They are affected by the airfoil’s angle of attack in  the air, the speed of airflow, the air density, and the  shape of the airfoil or wing.  

# Newton’s Laws of Motion  

Newton’s laws of motion provide the foundation for the  student’s understanding of basic aerodynamic principles.  The instructor should develop multiple ways of explaining  these laws to ensure that if the student does not comprehend  one explanation, the instructor has an alternate explanation  that relates to something that the student will understand.  Begin with relating the laws to helicopter flight, such as  the requirements for lift, thrust, and power to overcome  the effects of the three laws and the energy state of the  helicopter. If the student has a difficult time understanding  flight examples, try using an example that is more familiar,  such as a car or motorcycle. This helps the student better  understand the laws when the instructor applies it to flight.  

First Law—the Law of Inertia  

A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion remains  in motion at the same speed and in the same direction unless  acted upon by some external force. The key point to explain is  that if there is no net force resulting from unbalanced forces  acting on an object (if all the external forces cancel each  other out), then the object maintains a constant velocity. If  that velocity is zero, then the object remains at rest. And, if  an additional external force is applied, the velocity changes  because of the force.  

A helicopter in flight is a particularly good example of the  first law of motion. There are four major forces acting on an  aircraft: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. If we consider the motion  of an aircraft at a constant altitude, we can neglect the lift and  weight. A cruising aircraft flies at a constant airspeed and the  thrust exactly balances the drag of the aircraft. This is the first  part sited in Newton’s first law; there is no net force on the  helicopter and it travels at a constant velocity in a straight line.  

Now, if the pilot changes the thrust of the engine, the thrust  and drag are no longer in balance. If the thrust is increased,  the helicopter accelerates and the velocity increases. This is  the second part sited in Newton’s first law; a net external force  changes the velocity of the object. The drag of the helicopter  depends on the square of the velocity. So, the drag increases  with increased velocity. Eventually, the new drag equals the  new thrust level and at that point, the forces again balance out,  and the acceleration stops. The helicopter continues to fly at  a new constant velocity that is higher than the initial velocity.  We are again back to the first part of the law with the helicopter  traveling at a constant velocity.  

In this example, only the motion of the helicopter in a  horizontal direction is explained and as the student becomes  comfortable with aerodynamics, further discussions should  include the effects of the thrust on weight and on lift. For  example, increasing the throttle setting increases the fuel  usage and decreases the weight, and the increase in velocity  increases the lift as well as the drag. Each of these changes  effect the vertical motion of the helicopter.  

It is important to point out the role of engine power when  explaining the law of inertia. Power is used to accelerate  the helicopter, to change its velocity, and thrust is used to  balance the drag when the helicopter is cruising at a constant  velocity. When a helicopter is on a normal approach, the  power demand is generally in the middle range and the total  drag is at the lowest. As the aircraft decelerates to effective  translational lift airspeed and terminates to a hover, the  power demand is quite significant, generally the highest of  all maneuvers. An airplane makes minimal power demands at  the termination of its approach through the flare and landing.  

Second Law—The Law of Acceleration  

A change in velocity with respect to time. The force  required to produce a change in motion of a body is directly  proportional to its mass and rate of change in its velocity.  

For example, for a given helicopter, acceleration would be  slower when loaded to maximum gross weight than when  loaded to a lesser gross weight. During a normal takeoff, the  power margin available between maximum torque available  and hover power can be quite small based on helicopter  weight and environmental factors. During the transition  to forward flight and through effective translational lift  airspeed, acceleration is limited until the aircraft is in smooth  undisturbed air and the influence of induced drag begins to  subside. Once the aircraft reaches its maximum endurance/ rate of climb airspeed, acceleration potential is increased as  total drag is at its lowest point.  [Figure 3-1, Point E]  

![](images/d7e551696ebf41f3602c39f15d175adbe03cf9f0ae3705bf32fe584b1c815617.jpg)  
Figure 3-1.   Drag graph.  

Total drag is the sum of parasite drag and induced drag as  shown in  Figure 3-1, Point A and   $C$  .  The total drag curve  can also be referred to as the thrust required curve because  thrust is the force acting opposite drag. At the point where  total drag  [Figure 3-1, Point  $D J$   and thrust required are at a  minimum, the lift-to-drag ratio is maximum and is referred  to as  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  . At  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , the entire airframe is at its most  efficient, producing the most lift for the least drag. Maximum  endurance is found at  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , because thrust required and  thus fuel flow (fuel required) are at a minimum, giving  maximum time airborne.  

# Third Law—Action and Reaction  

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The  instructor should relate the third law to the amount of power  applied to the rotor system and the need for the antitorque  or tail rotor to supply the equal and opposite reaction to the  torque of the engine(s) applied to the main rotor. The rotor  system of a helicopter accelerates air downward, resulting  in an upward thrust. A single-rotor helicopter demonstrates  this law perfectly. Consider a helicopter on floats that is  not moored to a dock. As the main rotor begins to turn  counterclockwise during aircraft start, the fuselage reacts  by turning in a clockwise direction until the point at which  the tail rotor has reached sufficient rpm to provide the thrust  necessary to counteract that force.  

Torque effect is a result of Newton’s laws and an aspect of  helicopter flight that a student must thoroughly understand.  The turning of the helicopter’s main rotor blades in one  direction causes the helicopter to turn in the opposite  direction. In most helicopters, this is counteracted by the use  of a second rotor (tail rotor) to provide the thrust to limit the  rotation. Some helicopters use vectored air, while others use  a counterrotating main rotor system. All have one thing in  common—a method of counteracting the torque of the main  rotor system.  [Figure 3-2]  

![](images/25ceb344657490a8b8efdaf918aadf557d0a453f0fe4ed72e5997898332c7b7a.jpg)  
Figure 3-2.   Rotation direction.  

At some point in training, the instructor should have the  student bring the helicopter to a high hover and explain that  work load is greater and an increased left pedal requirement  exists to hold a constant heading. The opposite can be shown  at a lower hover with a decrease in left pedal requirement to  hold the same heading.  

# Weight  

As weight increases, the power required to produce lift needed  to compensate for the added weight must also increase. This  is accomplished through the use of the collective. Most  performance charts include weight as one of the variables  and students must be aware of the importance of managing  aircraft weight to obtain optimum performance. By reducing  weight, the helicopter is able to safely take off or land at  locations that would otherwise be impossible.  

Explain to students how maneuvers that increase the G loading  such as steep turns, rapid flares, or pulling out of a dive create  greater load factors and act as a multiplier of weight. The  load factor is the actual load on the rotor blades at any time,  divided by the normal load or gross weight.  [Figure 3-3]  At   $30^{\circ}$   of bank, the load factor is 1G, but at  $60^{\circ}$  , it is 1.8G, an  increase of 80 percent. If the weight of the helicopter is 1,600  pounds, the weight supported by the rotor in a  $30^{\circ}$   bank at a  constant altitude would be approximately 1,600 pounds. In  a   $60^{\circ}$   bank, it would be 2,880 pounds and in an   $80^{\circ}$   bank,  it would be 8,000 pounds. Emphasize to students that an  additional cause of large load factors is rough or turbulent  air. The severe vertical gusts produced by turbulence can  cause a sudden increase in angle of attack (AOA), resulting  in increased rotor blade loads that are resisted by the inertia  of the helicopter.  

![](images/060ea258c3ec1d7653979da3e98f0c00cc4a3fc377fd35e2559b43ac5957ce9d.jpg)  
Figure 3-3.   Load factor.  

# Thrust  

Thrust, like lift, is generated by the rotation of the main rotor  system. Point out to the student that in a helicopter thrust can  be forward, rearward, sideward, or vertical. The direction  of the thrust is controlled with the cyclic. If cyclic control  to produce thrust is too great, lift is lost and the aircraft  descends. Conversely, if too little cyclic control is made,  the aircraft begins a climb. Using visual aids, demonstrate  how the resultant lift and thrust determines the direction of  movement of the helicopter.  [Figure 3-4]  

Explain to the student that the tail rotor also produces thrust.  The amount of thrust is variable through the application of  

![](images/7e985debc8809533cdb4da10cbd61d1e223c5928ab21270c05b8215f43fa1ec2.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.   Thrust.  

the antitorque pedals and is used to control the helicopter’s  heading during hovering flight and trim during cruise flight.  

# Drag  

No discussion of aerodynamics is complete without its  defining the three types of drag, how drag is created, and its  effect on the aircraft. A certificated flight instructor (CFI)  must become intimately familiar with the drag chart and how  it relates to airspeed and power demands. Demonstrate this  during the performance planning phase as the student has  actual torque values to compare. Then, when the student is  flying the helicopter, apply the values that were computed  and show the effect on the helicopter. A technique is to  show how each flight control is affected by simple hover  flight maneuvers. Demonstrate the change in torque that  occurs between left and right pedal turns and explain why.  Discuss how the cyclic is utilized to hold position over the  ground, while the pedals rotate the fuselage and control  heading. When excess power is available, demonstrate how  the collective pitch can be applied to vary the hover height,  or to accelerate the helicopter. It would be prudent to discuss  here that if no excess power is available, application of the  collective then may be used to control the rotor rpm. This is  done by changing the pitch in the blades. Over application  of the collective in a low power margin setting results in  rotor rpm decay and a loss of lift. Rotor rpm is the key to  sustaining the aircraft in a steady state profile and should  never be allowed to decay below minimum operating levels.  It is the key to life for a helicopter pilot!  

# The types of drag are:  

1.	 Parasite drag—drag created by the fuselage or any  nonlifting components (e.g., strut, skin friction,  interference).  

2.	 Profile drag—caused by the frictional resistance of  the rotor blades passing through the air.  3.	 Induced drag—results from producing lift. a.	 Blade tip vortices—pressure differential at tips of  blades trying to equalize and produce a stream of  vortices (turbulence). b.	 Induced flow—causes lift and total aerodynamic  force to tilt further rearward on the airfoil. c.	 Total aerodynamic force tilted further backward  at higher angles of attack. 4.	 Total drag—sum of induced, profile, and parasite.  

Use a graph that depicts drag/power relationship, and have  the student identify the power requirements to overcome drag  at various airspeeds.  [Figure 3-1]  

The following describes the relationship of each of the  different types of drag to the airspeed of the aircraft.  

1.	 Parasite drag—lowest point at a hover, but increases  with airspeed. The major source of drag at higher  airspeeds.  2.	 Profile drag—remains relatively constant at low  airspeed, but increases slightly at higher airspeed  ranges. 3.	 Induced drag—major source of drag at a hover, but  decreases with forward airspeed. 4.	 Total drag—the sum total of induced, profile, and  parasite drag. a.	 Total drag decreases with forward airspeed  until best rate of climb speed is reached.  [Figure 3-1, Point E] b.	 Speeds greater than best rate of climb causes a  decrease in overall efficiency due to increasing  parasite drag.  

Once the student understands the forces acting on the  helicopter, provide examples of balanced and unbalanced flight  forces. For example, when hovering stationary in calm wind  at a constant altitude, thrust is equal to drag and lift is equal to  weight. The aircraft is not moving vertically or horizontally.  The aerodynamic forces are balanced.  [Figure 3-5]  

The student will also notice during hovering flight in a calm  wind condition that with smaller American made helicopters  like the Robinson R-22, Bell 206, and Schweizer 300, the left  side of the aircraft will probably hang lower than the right.  This is due to the direction of the tail rotor thrust and the  engineered mast tilt to compensate for translating tendency.  

![](images/703c5eb0915cdcbd5cae29ac4253578f18afa0e4a8040ce0ba29b8b3d6e55409.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.   Balanced forces in hover.  

On much larger helicopters such as the BH-205, S-76, and  BK-117, in which an additional gearbox is used to raise the  tail rotor up to the main rotor plane, the tilting of the fuselage  is not as prevalent.  

The pitch attitude will vary depending on the loading of the  helicopter. Many helicopters when flown single pilot will be  nose high at a hover. Conversely, they may be nose load when  fully loaded. The center of gravity (CG) of the helicopter  determines which portion of the landing gear will come off  the ground first. The CFI must pay particular attention to the  attitude of the helicopter as the student lifts it off the ground.  If excess power is applied in other than a level attitude, the  helicopter may proceed to roll beyond its dynamic rollover  limits. When lifted off the surface correctly and safely, the  pilot has the opportunity to lower the collective if a portion  of the landing gear is attached or hung on the surface, thus  preventing a rollover incident from occurring. It is imperative  that the CFI closely monitor the attitude of the helicopter  and not the actions of the student. This simple action may  determine whether or not the helicopter is allowed to stray  beyond the comfort level of the instructor to recover from a  particular action by the student. Never allow a student to go  beyond your comfort level.  

Several inputs are required simultaneously as the aircraft is  brought to a hover. Stress to the student that these actions  must occur without delay or coordinated flight will not  occur. For example, as the collective is increased to lift the  helicopter off the surface, the throttle must also be increased.  Even if a governor accomplishes that action, the pilot still must  monitor the power instruments to ensure that no limits are  exceeded. With the increase in power, there is also an increase  in torque and the tendency for the nose to turn to the right. The  pilot must apply sufficient left pedal to maintain the helicopter  heading. While this is occurring and the lift in the rotor system  is changing, the pilot must apply cyclic to maintain position  over the ground and not allow the helicopter to drift in any one  direction. The helicopter bank attitude might not be level due to  crosswinds and translating tendency. The pitch attitude might  not be level due to tailwinds or CG. The pilot must ensure that  the tail rotor is clear of all obstacles and is not allowed to hang  so low that it impacts the ground or other objects.  

For example, in steady state flight, the aircraft is maintaining  a constant airspeed and constant altitude. The aerodynamic  forces are balanced. Although the helicopter is moving, it is  not accelerating or climbing.  [Figure 3-6]  

![](images/4b8ef0e6cb99051d635635f1fc2dfb08245e6c7e18eda98393906e1de0d92dc1.jpg)  
Figure 3-6.   Steady state—balanced forces.  

Any time opposing forces become unequal (unbalanced),  acceleration results in direction of the greater force. If lift is  greater than weight the helicopter climbs. If thrust is greater  than drag, the helicopter moves horizontally. Point out that  thrust can occur in any or all directions. For example, if the  helicopter is moving sideways or backwards, thrust is in the  direction that it is moving.  [Figure 3-7]  

# Airfoil  

Define and discuss the different types of airfoils with the  student and stress the importance of using standardized  terminology. An airfoil is a curved surface body or structure  designed to produce a lift or thrust force when subjected to an  airflow. An instructor can check the student’s understanding  of airfoils and the terminology used to describe them by  having the student draw and label the parts of an airfoil.  [Figure 3-8]  Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge and the Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-  8083-21) for definitions and illustrations of airfoil design.  

# Blade Twist  

Explain to the student that the rotor blade of a helicopter  is designed with a twist to relieve the stresses on the blade  

![](images/3620ca6cea9ac7a55b11d054f42887df604adbbf21aa8de48090253d26ab9df2.jpg)

Figure 3-8.   Elements of an airfoil.  

and distribute lifting force more evenly along the blade due  to the lift differential along the blade. Blade twist provides  greater pitch angles at the blade root where velocity is low  and smaller angles at the tip where blade velocity is higher.  This increases the induced air velocity and blade loading near  the inboard section of the blade.  

# Rotor Blade and Hub Definitions  

The CFI must be familiar with the following basic terms and  be able to explain them to the student.  

1.	 Hub—the attachment point of the rotor blades. 2.	 Tip of the blade—the farthest outboard section of the  rotor blade. 3.	 Root of the blade—the section of the blade closest to  the hub and where the attachment point is located. 4.	 Twist—the change in blade angle with respect to the  angle at the hub outward to the tip. 5.	 Taper—the change (decrease) in blade chord with  radial distance.  

These terms related to the rotor hub and blades are best  discussed in the classroom and identified on the aircraft  during a preflight.  

# Airflow and Reactions in the Rotor  System  

When introducing and describing the airflow in a rotor  system, the instructor must first identify the types of relative  wind. By defining and explaining the various air movements  in a rotor system  [Figure 3-9]  and the relationship of air  movement to an airfoil, the instructor establishes a foundation  for more detailed discussions of aerodynamic principles.  

![](images/41c59540c1f15485b6300ad03f798e968e14e8bfa528ca28690cfedaef10795c.jpg)  
Figure 3-9.   Air movements in a rotor blade system.  

•	 The movement of a rotor blade through the air creates  relative wind. Relative wind moves in a parallel but  opposite direction to the movement of the rotor blade. •	 The flow of air parallel to and opposite the flightpath  of an airfoil is rotational relative wind. It always meets  the airfoil at a  $90^{\circ}$   angle. •	 The component of the total relative wind velocity  created by forward flight velocity/airspeed is airspeed  relative wind.  

•	 Induced flow (downwash) is a downward component  of air that is added to the rotational relative wind. •	 Resultant relative wind is the airflow from rotation  (rotational relative wind) that is modified by induced  flow. •	 Up flow (inflow) is airflow approaching the rotor disk  from below as the result of some rate of descent. Up  flow also occurs as result of blades flapping down or  an updraft.  

A demonstration of the airflow in the following instances  helps the student understand the concept of relative wind:  

•	 Airfoil moving in one direction •	 Rotating rotor blades •	 Advancing blade •	 Retreating blade •	 Relative winds are the same for tail rotor  

# Rotor Blade Angles  

Angle of incidence is the acute angle between the chord line  of the airfoil and the plane of rotation (tip path plane) or the  angle between the chord line of a blade and the relative wind.  Sometimes, this is referred to as the blade pitch angle. The  angle is changed through rotation of the rotor blade around its  spanwise axis, which is known as feathering.  [Figure 3-10] An instructor can use training aids to discuss the angle of  incidence in the classroom, but it is best demonstrated at  the aircraft. Show the student how the angle of incidence  

![](images/987a6897a844842db639c54ba459c7313665e770014b434244ffa2d27c2a4ca6.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.   Rotor blade feathering.  

is changed on all blades (except tail rotor) simultaneously  by using the collective pitch control. Define this action as  collective feathering and explain how it affects the overall  lift of the rotor system.  

Demonstrate how the cyclic pitch control causes a differential  change in the angle of individual blades (except tail rotor)  and define it as cyclic feathering. Stress to the student that  cyclic feathering changes the attitude of the rotor system but  does not change the amount of lift.  [Figure 3-11]  

Point out how the angle of incidence for the tail rotor is  changed on all tail rotor blades simultaneously by using the  antitorque pedals.  

•	 Stress that angle of incidence is a mechanical angle.  [Figure 3-12] •	 Remind the student that the AOA is the acute angle  between the chord line of an airfoil and the resultant  relative wind. It can change with no change in the  angle of incidence due to blade flapping and up/down  drafts. •	 Stress that angle of attack is an aerodynamic angle.  [Figure 3-12]  

Discuss lift at different AOAs. With the use of diagrams, an  instructor can explain how the AOA affects the amount of  lift. An easy demonstration of how the AOA affects lift is to  remind the student of what happens if an arm is extended out  of the window of a moving vehicle. Using guided discussion  and demonstration, ask the student what happens when the  palm of the hand is parallel to the ground and when it is  rotated forward. Show the student how the hand rises until  reaching the point at which it stalls and is just pulled rearward.  Emphasize the following principles:  

1.	 Larger angles of attack create more lift on an airfoil. 2.	 Smaller angles of attack result in a reduction of lift on  the airfoil. 3.	 Exceeding the maximum (critical) angle can produce  a stall. Maximum angle of attack is  $15^{\circ}$   to  $20^{\circ}$   on most  airfoils.  

# Hovering Flight  

It is essential for the student to understand the aerodynamics  of hovering. Explain that for a helicopter to hover, lift  produced by the rotor system must equal the total weight of  the helicopter. An increase of blade pitch through application  of collective increases the angle of incidence and generates  the additional lift necessary to hover. As forces of lift and  weight are in balance during stationary hover, those forces  must be altered through application of collective either to  climb or to descend.  

![](images/34e7fcaf82a417c1f4174e39b53aded08a8d4528f29049ffff95e6a54e7f2f7b.jpg)  
Without Cyclic Feathering  

![](images/d5435d085605b1b60f693f1fd0746076f17a717575fb4a17debc1b538e8cc1f4.jpg)  
Figure 3-11.   Rotor blades with and without cyclic feathering.  

Describe to the student how, at a hover, the rotor-tip  vortex reduces effectiveness of the outer blade portions.  [Figure 3-13]  Vortices of the preceding blade affect the lift  of the other blades in the rotor system. When maintaining  a stationary hover, this continuous creation of vortices  combined with the ingestion of existing vortices is the primary  cause of high power requirements for hovering. Rotor-tip  vortices are part of the induced flow and increase induced drag.  Ensure that the student understands that, during hover, rotor  blades move large amounts of air through the rotor system in  a downward direction. This movement of air also introduces  induced flow into relative wind, which alters the AOA of the  airfoil. If there is no induced flow, relative wind is opposite  and parallel to the flightpath of the airfoil. With a downward  airflow altering the relative wind, the AOA is decreased  so that less aerodynamic force is produced. This change  requires an increase in collective pitch to produce enough  aerodynamic force to hover.

Figure 3-13.   Air movements in a rotor blade system.  

# Translating Tendency or Drift  

Explain to the student that the thrusting characteristics of  a tail rotor during hovering flight create a tendency for  the helicopter to drift laterally, which is called translating  tendency. A single-rotor helicopter with a counterclockwise  rotating main rotor tends to drift laterally to the right. Stress  the cause: thrust exerted by the tail rotor compensates for  main rotor torque. Translating tendency is to the left in a  helicopter with a clockwise rotation of the main rotor.  

Explain to the student that the helicopter fuselage will remain  relatively level to slightly left side low. The amount of  fuselage tilt varies between types and design of helicopters.  The tip path plane of the main rotor will not be level and will  have to be adjusted accordingly with cyclic to counteract  translating tendency and adverse wind conditions. The  ability to tilt or adjust the wings of the helicopter allows the  helicopter to maintain its position over the ground.  

Describe the methods used to correct for translating tendency:  

1.	 Flight control rigging may be designed by the  manufacturer so the rotor disk is tilted slighted when  the cyclic control is centered to compensate for drift.  2.	 Transmission may be mounted so the mast is tilted  slightly when the helicopter fuselage is laterally level.  3.	 Pilot applies cyclic in the opposite direction to arrest  the drift.  

# Pendular Action  

Pendular action is the result of the CG being below the  supporting structure (rotor system). Tilting the rotor in one  direction results in the fuselage swinging in the opposite  direction. Stress to the student that this swinging is normal  for helicopter operation since the helicopter fuselage is below  the rotor system and overcontrolling can result in exaggerated  pendular action and should be avoided. The cyclic should  always be moved at a rate that allows the main rotor and  fuselage to move as a unit. Emphasize that the student should  use slow, smooth, cyclic inputs while hovering. The student  must understand that it is the relationship of the tip path  plane to the horizon, and not the position of the fuselage, that  determines the helicopter’s direction of travel.  

# Coning  

Coning is the upward flexing of the rotor blades. Point out  to the student that coning is a normal phenomenon in all  rotors producing lift. The amount a blade cones is a resultant  between lift and centrifugal force. When lift is stronger than  centrifugal force, the blade cones upward. When centrifugal  force is stronger than lift, the blade moves downward,  reducing the coning angle.  [Figure 3-14]  

![](images/f0f19e83f29483b5b23b0c53fa93c72b96ce5f21a44f232be2376a247d9f088f.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.   Effect of centrifugal force and lift.  

Explain the relationship between lift and excessive coning  and describe the causes of excessive coning to the student:  

•	 Low revolutions per minute (rpm)—less centrifugal  force •	 High gross weight—more lift needed •	 High G maneuvers—more lift needed •	 Turbulent air—point out to the student that any  maneuvers requiring additional lift could lead to  excessive coning.  

Give examples of excessive coning. Ensure the student  understands:  

•	 Flight conditions that require large amounts of lift may  lead to an excessive coning condition in the rotor. •	 As lift forces increase in the rotor, they overcome  the rigidity produced by centrifugal force. The rotor  blades begin flexing upward, which could lead to an  excessive coning angle.  

![](images/76a3901b81142e4d03a75eeebaabd19ee984fb9ae980506ca1b35ac1a92430b8.jpg)  
Guide the student in identifying the adverse effects of  excessive coning in the rotor system.  [Figure 3-15]  

1.	 Loss of disk area. 2.	 Loss of total lift available. 3.	 Stress on blades. 4.	 Excessive stress forces in the rotor could lead to blade  cracking or blade separation from the rotor system. 5.	 Excessive coning combined with low rotor rpm may  cause the blades to droop much lower than normal.  This condition is likely to occur at the end of an  autorotation and may allow the rotor blades to damage  or remove the tail boom. 6.	 Excessive coning may become unrecoverable in flight.  

# Coriolis Effect (Law of Conservation of  Angular Momentum)  

The law of conservation of angular momentum states that  the value of angular momentum of a rotating body will not  change unless external torques are applied. Explain to the  student that, in other words, a rotating body continues to  rotate with the same rotational velocity until some external  force is applied to change the speed of rotation. Angular  momentum can be expressed by the formula:  

# Mass Angular  $\times$    Velocity  $\times$   Radius Squared  

Discuss how changes in angular velocity, known as angular  acceleration or deceleration, take place if the mass of a  rotating body is moved closer to or further from the axis of  rotation. The speed of the rotating mass increases or decreases  in proportion to the square of the radius. These forces cause  acceleration and deceleration.  

Tell the student that the coriolis effect may be stated in the  following terms.  

A mass moving radically—  

•	 Outward on a rotating disk exerts a force on its  surroundings in the direction opposite to rotation.  •	 Inward on a rotating disk exerts a force on its  surroundings in the direction of rotation.  

The major rotating elements in the system are the rotor blades.  As the rotor begins to cone due to G-loading maneuvers, the  diameter of the disk shrinks. Due to conservation of angular  momentum, the blades continue to travel the same speed even  though the blade tips have a shorter distance to travel due to  reduced disk diameter. This action results in an increase in  rotor rpm. Most pilots arrest this increase with an increase  in collective pitch.  

Conversely, as G-loading subsides and the rotor disk flattens  out from the loss of G-load induced coning, the blade tips now  have a longer distance to travel at the same tip speed. This  action results in a reduction of rotor rpm, and is corrected  by reducing collective pitch.  

# Ground Effect  

Define ground effect for the student as the increased  efficiency of the rotor system caused by interference of the  airflow when near the ground. Discuss how ground effect  permits relative wind to be more horizontal, the lift vector  to be more vertical, and induced drag to be reduced, all  allowing the rotor system to be more efficient. Maximum  ground effect is achieved when hovering over smooth hard  surfaces. When hovering over such terrain as tall grass, trees,  bushes, rough terrain, and water, ground effect is reduced.  Explain the two reasons for this phenomenon: induced flow  and vortex generation.  [Figure 3-16]  

![](images/a4174234f83882668c1ce0c63ee328b6709a65f924d4035562b09202a9f4ffb8.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.   Airflow at altitude of one rotor disk diameter or less.  

# Gyroscopic Precession  

Explain to the student that precession occurs in rotating  bodies that manifest an applied force  $90^{\circ}$   after application in  the direction of rotation. Point out that although precession  is not a dominant force in helicopter aerodynamics, pilots  and designers must consider it since turning rotor systems  exhibit some of the characteristics of a spinning gyro.  Figure 3-17  illustrates effects of precession on a typical rotor  disk when force is applied at a given point. A downward  force applied to the disk at point A results in a downward  movement of the disk at point B. Aircraft designers take  gyroscopic precession into consideration and rig the cyclic  pitch control system to create an input   $90^{\circ}$   ahead of the  desired action.

# Vertical Flight  

A student must understand that for climbing flight to occur,  lift must be greater than weight. This is true whether at a hover  or in steady state flight. Refer back to the forces acting on an  aircraft in flight when explaining this concept.  

# Forward Flight  

When explaining forward flight to the student, refer to the  section on forces acting on an aircraft in flight. Remind the  student that flight is the result of all forces, and that lift and  thrust must be equal to the result of weight and drag for steady  state flight. Point out that acceleration in forward flight is the  result of thrust being greater than drag.  

# Translational Lift  

Translational lift is the additional lift obtained from increased  efficiency of the rotor system with airspeed obtained either  by horizontal flight or by hovering into a wind. Describe  the airflow patterns during directional flight and explain the  causes of transitional lift.  

The relative wind entering the rotor system becomes more  horizontal and results in the following:  

1.	 A more vertical lift component 2.	 Less induced drag 3.	 An increased AOA 4.	 Less turbulent air entering the rotor system  

The airspeed range at which effective translational lift occurs  is approximately 16–24 knots. As rotor efficiency increases  and additional lift is produced due to more beneficial AOA,  the rotor disk flaps upward causing the nose to pitch up;  additional forward cyclic pressure is necessary at this point.  As the airspeed increases and more lift is produced in the aft  portion of the rotor disk, the nose tends to lower, requiring  some aft cyclic to maintain an accelerative attitude and safe  climb angle.  

Provide the student with a graph depicting drag at different  airspeeds. Using a graph like  Figure 3-1  and guided  discussion, ensure the student understands:  

1.	 Each knot of forward airspeed increases the  efficiency of the helicopter rotor system up to a  point where retreating blade stall aerodynamics  negate any further rotor system gains. 2.	 At effective translational lift (ETL), the rotor  system completely outruns the recirculation of  old vortices and begins to operate in smooth,  undisturbed air. 3.	 Induced drag and total drag are reduced and  overall rotor efficiency increases. 4.	 Increased efficiency continues with increased  airspeed until best climb speed is reached.  [Figure 3-1, Point E] 5.	 Airspeeds greater than best rate of climb speed  result in lower efficiency of the helicopter due to  increased parasite drag.  

# Translational Thrust  

Translational thrust occurs as the helicopter transitions to  forward flight and the tail rotor begins to operate in smooth  undisturbed air. As the takeoff proceeds, the pilot notices the  nose yaw (to the left in a counterclockwise turning system).  This is the result of the increased translational thrust. To  regain trimmed flight, a little right pedal is normally required.  At about this same aerodynamic point, the airflow begins  to smooth over the vertical stabilizer which carries some of  the antitorque load in forward flight. This allows for slightly  more reduction in tail rotor thrust, requiring further reduction  in left pedal application. If there is no governor, a throttle  change may be required to reduce the rpm slightly since the  power demand was reduced. Depending on the helicopters  position and airspeed, the rotor resultant rpm increase can  be controlled by a slight increase in collective to maintain  the rpm setting.  

# Induced Flow  

Explain to the student that, at flat pitch, air leaves the trailing  edge of the rotor blade in the same direction it moved across  the leading edge; thus, no lift or induced flow is being  produced. Demonstrate how, as blade pitch angle is increased,  the rotor system induces a downward flow of air through the  rotor blades, creating a downward component of air that is  added to the rotational relative wind. Point out that because  the blades are moving horizontally:  

•	 Some of the air is displaced downward. •	 The blades travel along the same path and pass a given  point in rapid succession.  

•	 Rotor blade action changes still air to a column of  descending air.  

This downward flow of air is called induced flow (downwash).  Emphasize that it is most pronounced at a hover under no- wind conditions.  

# Transverse Flow Effect  

Advise the student that in forward flight, air passing through  the rear portion of the rotor disk has a greater downwash angle  than air passing through the forward portion. Explain that  this difference in downwash angle is due to the fact that the  greater the distance air flows over the rotor disk, the longer  the disk has to work on it and the greater the deflection is  on the aft portion.  

Ensure the student understands:  

•	 Downward flow at the rear of the rotor disk causes a  reduced AOA, resulting in less lift.  •	 The front portion of the disk produces an increased AOA  and more lift because airflow is more horizontal.  •	 These differences in lift between the fore and aft  portions of the rotor disk are called transverse flow  effect. •	 Transverse flow effect causes unequal drag in the  fore and aft portions of the rotor disk and results in  vibration easily recognizable by the pilot.  •	 Transverse flow occurs between 10 and 20 knots.  

Stress to the student that transverse flow effect is most  noticeable during takeoff and, to a lesser degree, during  deceleration for landing. Demonstrate how gyroscopic  precession causes the effects to be manifested   $90^{\circ}$   in the  direction of rotation, resulting in a right rolling motion  requiring left cyclic input to maintain a more level fuselage  attitude and proper ground track.  

# Dissymmetry of Lift  

Dissymmetry of lift is the difference in lift that exists between  the advancing half of the rotor disk and the retreating half.  Explain to the student how to determine the total relative wind  velocity on the advancing and retreating blades.  

Discuss the relative wind velocity of blades at a hover and  during translational flight.  

# Hover  

At a hover, relative wind velocity is:  

•	 Approximately 400 knots at the tips. •	 Approximately 300 knots one-fourth of the way in  from the tips.  

•	 Approximately 200 knots one-half of the way in from  the tips. •	 Approximately 100 knots three-fourths of the way in  from the tips. •	 0 knots at the center of the hub.  

# Translational Flight  

In translational flight, relative wind velocity:  

•	 Is a combination of blade speed and airspeed. •	 Of the advancing blade is blade speed plus airspeed. •	 Of the retreating blade is blade speed minus airspeed.  

Develop the relative wind velocity for the advancing and  retreating blades in the  $090^{\circ}$   to  $270^{\circ}$   position.  [Figure 3-19] Show area of reverse flow. Emphasize that equal lift is created  by advancing and retreating blades.  

![](images/08712c4bb1de8aea3c66e32ec768e7a43f0db9c842d787293633180530e011d0.jpg)  
Figure 3-19.   Relative wind velocity in forward flight.  

1.	 Advancing blade—greater lift. 2.	 Retreating blade—less lift.  

Discuss roll and explain that American-designed helicopters  (counterclockwise rotation) would roll to the left and pitch up  if transverse flow and dissymmetry of lift were not overcome.  Explain main rotor method of overcoming dissymmetry of  lift (flapping).  

1.	 Advancing blade produces more lift; when flapping  up, AOA decreases due to an increase in induced  flow—loses lift. 2.	 Retreating blades produce less lift; when flapping  down, AOA increases due to a decrease in induced  flow—gains lift. 3.	 When blade flapping has compensated for dissymmetry  of lift, the rotor disk is tilted to the rear. 4.	 Cyclic feathering also compensates for dissymmetry  of lift (changes AOA) in the following ways: a.	 Cyclic feathering changes the angle of incidence  differently around the rotor system. b.	 Forward cyclic decreases angle of incidence on  advancing blade, resulting in reduced AOA, and  increases angle of incidence on retreating blade  resulting in increased AOA. 5.	 Tail rotor compensates for dissymmetry of lift  by both flapping and feathering at the same time,  accomplished by rotor design and mounting. A  delta hinge allows for flapping, which automatically  introduces feathering of the tail rotor.  

Exercise caution during a low-altitude, high-speed takeoff  as pitch attitude is very low. If an engine failure or partial  power condition were experienced, the pilot would not be  able to safely place the aircraft in an autorotative profile. A  quick review of the height velocity diagram would be very  useful here.  

# Sideward, Rearward, and Turning Flight  

Explain to the student that to accomplish these different  modes of flight, the rotor disk is tilted in the desired direction.  The forces acting on the helicopter remain the same, only  the resultant vectors are different. Sideward hovering flight  requires more pedal control to maintain heading. Depending  on the lateral speed of travel, some fuselage tilting can be  expected. Rearward flight must be accomplished slowly and  cautiously due to wind effects on the horizontal stabilizer  and the lowering of the tail rotor making surface contact  easier to occur.  

# Autorotation  

To help students better understand autorotation, divide it into  four distinct phases: entry, steady-state descent, deceleration,  and touchdown. Guide the student through each phase,  stressing how it is aerodynamically different from the others.  

# Entry  

Guide the student through the entry or first stage of  autorotation and explain that this phase is entered after loss  of engine power. The loss of engine power and rotor rpm  are more pronounced when the helicopter is at high gross  weight, high forward speed, or in high density altitude  conditions. Any of these conditions demand increased power  (high collective position) and a more abrupt reaction to loss  of that power. In most helicopters, it takes only seconds for  rpm decay to bring rpm to a minimum safe range, requiring  a quick collective response from the pilot. The entry into  autorotation must be immediate and smooth by lowering  the collective, adjusting the pedals for the loss of torque,  and adjusting the airspeed for the proper glide angle. The  instructor should never initiate an autorotation, or simulated  forced landing, unless there is suitable landing within glide  distance in the event of a powerplant or drive line failure.  

Discuss with the student the airflow and force vectors for  a blade in this configuration. Remind the student that lift  and drag vectors are large and the total aerodynamic force  (TAF) is inclined well to the rear of the axis of rotation. An  engine failure in this mode causes rapid rotor rpm decay.  Inform the student that to prevent this, a pilot must lower  the collective quickly.  

Explain to the student that as the helicopter begins to descend,  the airflow begins to flow upward and under the rotor system.  

# Steady-State Descent  

A irflow is now upward through the rotor disk because of the  descent. Once equilibrium is established, rate of descent and  rotor rpm are stabilized, and the helicopter is descending at  a constant angle. Angle of descent is normally   $17^{\circ}$   to   $20^{\circ}$  ,  depending on airspeed, density altitude, wind, and type of  helicopter. The instructor should guide the student through  any RFM procedures or charted values for minimum rates  of descent versus maximum glide distance if provided for  that helicopter.  

During this phase of the autorotation, the aircraft is  maneuvered to reach a safe landing area by adjusting airspeed  and making turns as appropriate while maintaining rotor rpm  at the proper range for the type of helicopter. Checklist items  are also completed as time permits and a Mayday call made.  

Explain to the student how the loss of engine power during  the autorotation requires the pilot to use the pedal controls  to keep the helicopter in trim throughout the descent until  the deceleration and touchdown point is reached, otherwise  the increased drag would greatly increase the rate of descent.  Also explain how the fuselage tends to weathervane into the  wind due to the vertical fin.  

# Deceleration  

Explain to the student that to make an autorotative landing,  the pilot reduces airspeed and rate of descent just before  touchdown. Both actions can be partially accomplished by  applying aft cyclic, which changes the attitude of the rotor  disk in relation to the relative wind. During this maneuver,  the goal of the pilot shifts from maintaining an airspeed to  attaining a minimum ground speed for touchdown while  decreasing the rate of descent. Ensure the student understands  that this attitude change:  

•	 Inclines the lift vector of the rotor system to the rear,  slowing forward speed.  •	 Increased airflow results in increasing rpm, which  must be controlled with the collective.  •	 The lifting force of the rotor system is increased and  rate of descent is reduced.  • 	 During this stage of the autorotation, the lack of torque  is noticeable and the aircraft fuselage may rotate  counterclockwise with application of the collective  due to frictional drag in the transmission, drive train,  associated pumps, and generators (depending on type  of helicopter). Pedal application will be required to  maintain a heading aligned with the touchdown area.  Any crosswind also causes the nose to weathervane into  the wind due to lift produced by the vertical fin.  

# Touchdown  

During this final phase of the autorotation with the airspeed  at a minimum as required for the conditions of the landing  area, the cyclic stick is moved forward to place the aircraft in  a landing attitude while applying collective pitch to cushion  the landing. The height at which this phase is entered depends  on the size of the helicopter and the length of the tailboom.  The landing attitude varies between helicopter designs from  touching the aft portion of the landing gear first as in an  airplane, to a level attitude with all surfaces touching down  at once. Each manufacturer has a preferred landing attitude  that must be used to. Heading control must be maintained  with the pedals to preclude the aircraft from rolling over once  ground contact is made.  

The instructor must ensure several conditions are met to allow  the helicopter to arrive at this point:  

1.	 The rate of descent, rotor rpm, and airspeed are all  within established parameters, as well as landing area  alignment and positioning. If any of these conditions  are not within limits, re-engage the engine and make  a power recovery or go-around. 2.	 The landing gear is and stays aligned with the ground  track of the helicopter.  3.	 The decelerating flare did not result in an increase in  altitude (ballooning) or was not begun at too high of  an altitude.  4.	 The student cannot be allowed to increase the  collective too soon, and the student must be prompted  to use available collective to cushion the landing soon  enough.  5.	 The collective must be used to cushion the touchdown,  but the student should not be allowed to hold the  helicopter off the surface.  6.	 The student must not be allowed to retain an excessive  decelerating attitude at too low an altitude allowing  a tailboom or tail rotor strike. The student must be  taught how to begin the flare and then decrease the  nose high attitude to a landing attitude.  7.	 The student cannot be allowed to move the cyclic  aft after touchdown. This generally allows the rotor  blades to dip aft over the tailboom and when occurring  at the same time as the actual touchdown, results in a  tailboom strike.  

8.	 The student cannot be initially allowed to lower the  collective after touchdown. Once the helicopter is  completely down and no longer subject to bouncing  and flexing, some helicopter RFMs allow a slight  decrease in collective to aid stopping and to decrease  low rpm blade flexing.  

For a detailed description and illustration of autorotation,  refer to chapter 11 of the Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-  8083-21, as revised).

# Helicopter Flight Controls  

# Introduction  

When introducing a student to the flight controls of a  helicopter, the instructor must ensure the student understands  how each control affects the flight of the aircraft.  [Figure 4-1]   The student may not be comfortable with the helicopter  controls for some time, but must understand the function  of each control and the reactions of the other controls when  control movements are made. For example, if increasing the  collective pitch increases power. If the engine is manually  controlled, the throttle must be adjusted to maintain  

![](images/70ca7ced3686b1af8d1b4c7a08aa2c8f51845d4c4c3652f895633004afc5e640.jpg)  

revolutions per minute (rpm). If the helicopter powerplant  has a governor, then the pilot must ensure that power stays  within limitations. If the cyclic is moved, then the collective  must be moved to maintain altitude because lift has now  been redirected into thrust for travel. Anytime the collective  is moved, the pedals must be adjusted for heading or trim.  Training for this control coordination can be accomplished  by using a simulator or a helicopter. Use of a simulator for  this instruction reduces student stress levels and may enhance  learning. If a simulator is not available and instruction takes  place in a helicopter, the instructor should ensure the student  understands the location and function of each control. It is also  imperative that the instructor stay close to the flight controls  during all phases of flight.  

Flying a helicopter is inherently demanding due to all of the  moving parts and the controls available to the student and  the instructor alike. It is paramount that the instructor be  able to manipulate the controls to keep the aircraft in a safe  flight profile at altitude and as the student is moved to flight  modes requiring increasingly more vigilance, such as a hover  in proximity to the ground, other aircraft, and personnel.  As the instructor, develop a safety-focused teaching style  while being inconspicuous to the student. This is called the  “instructor pilot ready position.” It is recommended that  the instructor be very close to the controls so the student  cannot move the controls too far or the controls will hit  the instructors waiting hand or foot. A good instructor  forms a boundary area around the controls in which the  student can operate the controls without interference from  the instructor’s fingers and feet. This boundary formation  should ensure the helicopter stays within the instructor’s  personal limits, yet allow the student to develop a control  touch without interference. The instructor should always  judge the situation by the flight status and condition of the  helicopter, not by what the student is doing. It is what the  helicopter is doing that is important.  

Whether using a simulator or helicopter, beginning the flight  instruction at altitude is a good way to allow the student  to manipulate all of the controls at one time and with a  larger margin of error than beginning the flight instruction  at a hover. As the student’s proficiency increases and the  flight control inputs become smaller, the student can then  be allowed to fly lower and slower, ultimately terminating  an approach to a hover. A less preferred but widely used  technique is to let the student operate one control at a time  while the instructor operates the others so the student can  get the feel of a control and its function in flight. Always  emphasize making smooth, coordinated control inputs.  

# Collective Pitch Control  

Explain to the student that the collective changes the pitch  of the main rotor blades (angle of incidence) and, as a result  of that pitch angle change, is used to increase or decrease the  blade angle of attack (AOA). This is accomplished through  a series of mechanical linkages that changes the angle of  incidence of all blades simultaneously, or collectively.  [Figure 4-2]  Demonstrate on a static helicopter how pulling  up on the collective increases the pitch of the rotor blades  while lowering the collective decreases the pitch. Explain  how the collective is used to increase both lift and thrust by  changing the lift vector.  

Stress to the student that the collective must be kept free  of obstructions at all times. The instructor must ensure the  student understands the importance of ensuring the collective  is free to move through its full range of travel and is kept clear  of anything that could limit movement, such as a thigh, map,  cell phone, camera, or even an article of clothing.  

An instructor may demonstrate how to use the collective  to initiate takeoff, climb, and descent. One technique for  practicing the application of collective pitch occurs during  flight. Climb to a safe altitude and allow the student to operate  the collective to climb, descend, and maintain altitude during  a turn. Explain the proper application and use of collective  friction. Demonstrate how the collective is used to maintain  a constant altitude during accelerations and decelerations.  During this demonstration, the instructor initially maintains  level flight with the other controls and gradually allows the  student to have the others controls as proficiency is gained.  

# Throttle Control  

A student must thoroughly understand the intricacies of  the helicopter being flown. While some helicopters have  a governor to control the engine revolutions per minute  (rpm), or a correlator to increase/decrease throttle inputs  automatically to an acceptable range that generally requires  some pilot input, other models rely solely on the pilot’s  manual input of twisting the throttle.  [Figure 4-3]  Even  when rpm is controlled by a governor or fuel control system,  emergency procedures require manual operation of the  throttle to control engine and, ultimately, rotor rpm.  

![](images/8324833de5fa0fafead657985bd6af6e3b72d09697875adc80ab56e49b964326.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.   There are four major controls in the helicopter that the pilot must use during flight: collective pitch, throttle, cyclic pitch,  and antitorque.  

![](images/6dae8133ad8a2cf89092c53e6142198175c294eb78ae7f663dc6e98a9ac295a5.jpg)  
Figure 4-3.   A typical throttle that requires manual twisting.  

Manual operation of a nongoverned throttle can be explained  and demonstrated during instruction on the collective. A  simple explanation that students may be able to relate to  is comparing the manually controlled engine to a manual  car transmission and a governed engine to an automatic  transmission. Proper use of the throttle is an integral part  of maintaining both engine and rotor rpm during flight.  Explain the use of throttle friction in reducing the sensitivity  of the throttle. While students who have experience riding  motorcycles or other powered recreational type vehicles are  familiar with the concept of a twist-grip throttle, instructors  must guard against twisting the throttle in the wrong direction  for a given application. Training on governor override  or manual throttle operation should be explained, but a  demonstration and practice should occur only after the student  has mastered all the control inputs required to fly. Explain that  revision to the manual mode of operation is an abnormal, or  emergency, procedure and is almost exclusive to reciprocating  powered helicopters. Few large turbine powered helicopters  have a manual override function suitable for training.  

Stress to the student the importance of checking the throttle  during the preflight. The throttle, whether governed or not,  must have freedom of movement from stop to stop. There  should be no binding or excessive stiffness in the operation  of the throttle. Point out that throttle control friction must be  decreased before checking the throttle.  

Special attention should be given to ensure that the throttle/ power lever is set in the “start” position prior to starting.  This position varies between aircraft design and is explained  in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual for the particular helicopter  being flown. Improper throttle or power lever settings can  lead to overspeed of a reciprocating engine due to the clutch,  or engine temperature exceeding limits with turbine powered  helicopters.  

# Cyclic Pitch Control  

A student should understand that moving the cyclic  control tilts the rotor system in the direction the cyclic is  displaced whether it is fore or aft, or in a side to side motion  thereby providing thrust in the direction the rotor is tilted.  [Figure 4-4]  This cyclic movement from the pilot’s right  

![](images/25057631bab96df29d00f28b33223281915ac17b4a40f3c44aba050071167e06.jpg)  
Figure 4-4.   Cyclic control stick position and the main rotor disk position relative to pilot in helicopter.  

hand results in the aircraft moving in the direction the pilot  desires as the cyclic is displaced. Any movement from the  cyclic has a corresponding effect on the pitch of each blade  either increased or decreased pitch as they move or cycle thru  every rotation  $360^{\circ}$  . This enables the aircraft to move in the  direction the pilot desires.  

Emphasis must be placed on keeping the cyclic free of  obstructions. Students must understand the importance of  ensuring the cyclic is free to move its full travel and to  keep it clear of anything that could interfere with or limit its  movement such as knee boards or passenger legs.  

Demonstrate the cyclic input required to hover. Initiate a  takeoff and climb to a safe altitude. Demonstrate how the  cyclic is used to maintain the pitch and bank attitude of the  helicopter and maintain a constant airspeed during climbs,  descents, and turns. Explain the use of the cyclic trim system  to relieve cyclic pressures and reduce pilot fatigue.  

During the preflight inspection, demonstrate movement of  the cyclic in all quadrants and allow the student to observe  the inputs made to the swashplate and main rotor system.  

# Antitorque Control  

Discuss the primary purpose of the antitorque system: to  counteract the torque effect created by the rotation of the  main rotor system. The antitorque system could consist of  vectored thrust from the engine or be provided by a tail  rotor. Explain that in either case, the function is the same.  Most training helicopters will utilize a tail rotor for this  purpose.  [Figure 4-5]  Antitorque pedals change the pitch of  the tail rotor and provide the thrust required to counteract the  torque effect. Discuss how the pedals are used to maintain  coordinated flight during cruise flight, but are used for heading  control during hovering flight. Operation of the antitorque  pedals through the full range of travel allows the student to  observe the pitch change in the tail rotor. Always remind the  student of the safety hazards of pinching, moving parts and to  keep well clear while the controls are being moved.  

Explain to the student the importance of keeping the  antitorque pedals free of obstructions and having full range  of movement. Emphasize that loose objects that fall during  flight and are not retrieved could jam the pedals and reduce  aircraft controllability.  

![](images/ba5948801cace0be13de31380e853300b5a9fdca86e0644fd68570efacf44170.jpg)  
Figure 4-5.   When the right pedal is pressed or moved forward of the neutral position, the tail rotor blades change the pitch angle and  the nose of helicopter yaws to the right. With the left pedal pressed or moved forward of the neutral position, the tail rotor blades change  the pitch angle opposite to the right pedal and the nose of helicopter yaws to the left.  

Demonstrate pedal inputs during a hover.  [Figure 4-6]  Climb  to a safe altitude and allow the student to operate the pedals  to maintain coordinated cruise flight. Demonstrate how the  pedals are used during climbs, descents, and coordinated  turns in cruise flight. Explain that when increasing collective  pitch, antitorque requirements are greater; when reducing  collective pitch, antitorque requirements are less. During this  demonstration, the instructor maintains coordinated flight  with the other controls.  

# Practice  

Once the student has practiced with each of the controls  individually, while still at a safe altitude, gradually turn over  control of the aircraft one control at a time. Remember, STAY  CLOSE to the flight controls. When the student has a basic  understanding and demonstrates the ability to control the  aircraft at altitude in cruise flight, use the same procedures  to introduce aircraft control during hovering flight.  

Allowing a beginning student to fly down a runway or  taxiway, or other set ground track. Making slower and lower  approaches will almost naturally lead the student into the  hovering mode, allowing a better understanding of control  response while avoiding the overly early and frightening  attempts at hovering flight. This technique allows them  to learn the changes in the helicopter’s response to lower  airspeeds and ground effects at their own pace.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Always practice positive exchange of controls  procedures and acknowledgments by using a three  way positive transfer of controls.  [Figure 4-7]  This  is particularly important in the early stages of training  when either the student or the flight instructor is on the  controls for a long period of time. If the instructor or  the student is following along on the controls, ensure  that both understand who has ultimate control over  the flight controls. •	 Always emphasize making smooth, coordinated  control inputs. •	 Always stay close to the controls. Be ready to take  control of the aircraft and never underestimate the  student’s ability to make a mistake. •	 Always practice initial hovering over smooth surfaces,  free of any protrusions that might catch the landing  gear. A lack of protrusion may allow the landing gear  to slide freely in case of accidental ground contact.

# Helicopter Components,  Sections, and Systems  

# Introduction  

When introducing the student to helicopter components,  sections, and systems, the instructor must ensure that the  student is familiar with and understands the basic functions  and use of each system. Ideally, this is accomplished by  use of a static aircraft or a mock-up of the aircraft depicting  most of the parts. Allowing the student to touch and  explore these components, sections, and systems enhances  learning. Knowing the basics of each major component,  section, and system gives the student a better ability to  recognize malfunctions and possible emergency situations.  Understanding the interactions of these systems allows the  student to make an informed decision and take appropriate  corrective action should a problem arise. Point out to the  student what should be checked during preflight.  

In addition to introducing the student to the various helicopter  components and systems, the instructor should also educate  the student on the different types of materials that are used to  make the components and the positive and negative factors  of each. If the student understands the various factors of the  components, the information can begin to form the basis of  component condition knowledge. This should enable the  student to better determine the flight status of the components  and what failure modes can appear as well as what the  record of the material is. Instructors should be creative and  attempt to explore comparisons for all helicopter components  and systems. There are no two helicopters alike from one  manufacturer to another. Flying a helicopter new to the pilot  should always include some ground school instruction on the  systems and a flight checkout on the specific characteristics of  that helicopter. Students should never assume that knowledge  of one helicopter’s systems should transfer to another.  

# Airframe Design  

Airframe design is a field of engineering that combines  aerodynamics, materials technology, and manufacturing  methods to achieve balances of performance, reliability  and cost, which can affect both maintenance and flight.  Composites, for example, are very sensitive to ultraviolet  (UV) radiation from the sun and must be painted to protect  them, whereas aluminum has minimum UV degradation from  the sunlight but will corrode over time if flown around salt  water. Aluminum is light and reasonable easy to fabricate into  parts, but composites can be much stronger although more  difficult to manufacture. In addition, composite materials  seem to suffer from bonding failures. In some structures, this  appears as a thickening or expansion, sometimes forming a  bubble in an area.  

# Rotor Blade Design  

Wooden rotor blades have an infinite fatigue life provided that  moisture is kept out of them. The metal attachment fittings on  the wooden blade do have a fatigue life; therefore, a life limit  is placed on the blade. Although wooden blades are used, they  do not perform as well as modern metal or composite blades.  Another comparison is composite rotor blades versus metal  rotor blades. Composite rotor blades are closer to an “on  condition” replacement status, potentially saving thousands  of dollars for operations but are softer and at least require the  leading edge abrasion strip to be replaced. Metal blades are  generally less expensive to manufacture; composite blades  may perform better and last longer with less maintenance,  but at a higher initial cost.  

# Powerplant Design  

When discussing the powerplant, comparisons of reciprocating  and turbine engines can be explained. A reciprocating engine  uses much less fuel than a turbine engine does, but turbine  engines can produce much more power from a very light  powerplant for more flight hours. However, a turbine engine  can easily be ten times the cost of a reciprocating powerplant.  Turbine engines are usually much more reliable, but failures  are often much more dramatic with high-speed shrapnel  flying through other structures, causing tremendous damage  throughout the powerplant.  

# Antitorque System Design  

Enclosed antitorque tailrotor systems are usually more  resistant to foreign object damage but can be more complicated  to build and heavier, which causes them to perform less well  than open antitorque systems. Open tailrotors may perform  better aerodynamically with less weight and less cost but are  more vulnerable to damage and tend to produce more drag  when flown at higher cruise airspeeds.  

# Landing Gear System Design  

Wheel type landing gear systems are easier to retract for  increased cruise speeds with less fuel flow and are much  easier to store and move when conducting maintenance.  Wheel type landing gear systems are more expensive  compared to skid type landing gear with many more parts to  inspect, buy, and maintain. They usually have brakes, which  also require inspection, service, repair, or replacement. Skid  type landing gear is a simpler design, easier to manufacture,  and reasonably light in weight. Skid landing gear is a parasitic  drag source, which increases exponentially at faster airspeeds.  Skid landing gear are less expensive overall but more difficult  to move for maintenance or storage and always requires  additional equipment on the ground.  

Inform the student to use care when handling the actual  helicopter, training aids, and/or training devices. Moving  parts, sharp edges, protruding components, and/or hydraulic  pressures may cause hazardous situations. Material Safety  Data Sheets (MSDS) instruction should be reviewed during  preflight and postflight if the student comes in contact with  any of the fluids in or on the helicopter.

Airframe discussions should explain that the airframe, or  structure, of a helicopter can be made of different types of  material.  Figure 5-1  is an example of the many different  materials that are used in the construction of a helicopter.  The importance of learning the structures and construction  materials of the helicopter is to help the student to determine  the airworthiness of the helicopter and potential failures and  hazards to be found on pre and post flight inspections. The  goal is not to make the pilot into a helicopter aeronautical  engineer but rather a safe pilot who can understand the  full consequences of an unknown condition of a helicopter  component. Helicopters can be made of metal, wood, or

composite materials, or a combination of the two. A sample  piece of the airframe from the manufacturer is a good prop  for introducing the student to the different types of material(s)  used. Point out some of the areas that may be made of a  variety of materials. One such area is near the exhaust or  other areas that must withstand extreme heat for which  most manufacturers use titanium. The following is a list of  advantages and disadvantages of aluminum and composites  that help the student learn about each.  

# Aluminum Advantages  

•	 Predictable strength, which is certified by the  manufacturer of the metal and which is recorded with  each batch. •	 The metal conductivity enables a single-wire electrical  system to be used, which saves weight and complexity.  •	 The metal conductivity maximizes antenna reception  and transmission. •	 Recognized lightning strike properties and protection.  

•	 Minimal UV degradation from sunlight.

 •	 Controllable moisture problems, such as corrosion.

 •	 Will transmit loads and can bend without failure.

 •	 Good bonding techniques can eliminate P-static for  better radio reception.

 •	 Smoothness of construction is predetermined; no  extensive sanding or filling is required.

 •	 Paint chips do not materially affect the integrity of the  underlying aluminum.

 •	 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  readily accepts it as a construction medium and is  knowledgeable about its physical properties, causing  minimal delays in the certification process.  

# Disadvantages  

•	 Form blocks must be built to hydroform the metal in a  soft state, which then has to be heat-treated to regain  its strength.  

•	 Due to the setup of the hydro-form process, there  is a high per-unit-part cost unless large batches are  produced at one time, in which case inventory carrying  costs increase.

 •	 Thin aluminum, as used in general aviation aircraft,  cannot be compound curved and still carry structural  loads, thereby increasing drag in some areas if  improperly engineered.

 •	 Antennas need to be exposed for proper operation,  necessitating the use of very expensive, low drag  antennas for high speed.

 •	 It is almost impossible to build laminar flow wings  with the skin thickness used in general aviation  aircraft.

 •	 Any flexing of the structure promotes metal fatigue  and can suffer from structural failure. 

 •	 Operation under certain conditions (ocean salty air,  corrosive chemicals found in agricultural operations)  can lead to corrosion caused structural failures.  

# Composite Construction Advantages  

•	 Ease of construction in small lots. These planes are  typically assembled by individuals in their garages.

 •	 Low cost for one-off projects as minimal tooling is  required.

 •	 Can be compound curved for maximum drag reduction  and still carry structural loads.

 •	 Electronic transparency means antennas can be hidden  inside for streamlining without loss of reception.

 •	 Easier to get smooth surfaces for laminar flow designs,  which contributes to some additional speed.

 •	 Cracks do not usually propagate in composite  structures.

 •	 Structures can be stronger for light weight components.  

# Disadvantages  

•	 Strength varies from batch to batch. Difficult to detect  voids.

 •	 Since there is no metal frame, there is no common  ground; a two-wire electrical system is required.

 •	 Without any electrical conductivity, there is very poor  lightning strike protection.

 •	 Ultraviolet light degradation due to sunlight.

 •	 Delamination problems due to moisture.  

•	 Composites tend to break without warning at failure  loads, unlike aluminum which can bend and still  survive, and usually provide some warning prior to  failure. •	 Poor electrical bonding causes static interference with  radios. •	 Requires expensive paint maintained in perfect  condition (without chips or scratches) to keep sunlight  and moisture out; otherwise, composites degrade like  an old fiberglass boat. Poor acceptance by the FAA  due to unknown physical properties, such as aging  and delamination.  •	 Very labor intensive to construct repeatable  components. •	 Composites do not afford any fire or heat protection  and can be the source of deadly fumes in the case of  an accident or fire.  •	 Composites require new tools and machines to repair.  

# Fuselage  

Perhaps one of the best teaching devices for the fuselage  discussion is an actual helicopter. Better yet is a helicopter  with all or most outside panels removed or undergoing  major maintenance or inspection. This open view provides  an opportunity for the instructor to point out (literally) to  the student engine housing, transmission, avionics, flight  controls, and the powerplant. Also, the student can view the  seating arrangement for your particular helicopter as you  identify where the pilot, crew, passengers, and cargo are  seated or placed.  [Figure 5-2]  

# Main Rotor System  

Rotor blade design and theory can be very complex to a  new student. Discussion should begin with simpler designs  and then move towards the more complex as the students  understanding progresses. A cut-away of the main rotor  assembly is a useful tool for instructors in a classroom  environment. This allows students to see how each input  from the cyclic and the collective affects the hub assembly.  A static helicopter is also very helpful in demonstrating the  moving parts of the hub assembly. Explain to the student  that the purpose of the main rotor is to produce lift. Show  the student the main parts of the mast, hub, and rotor blades.  

The three basic classifications of main rotor system are rigid,  semirigid, and fully articulated. Main rotor systems are  classified according to how the main rotor blades are attached  and their movement relative to the main rotor hub. Show  which rotor system is installed on the student’s particular  helicopter and how it is identified.  

![](images/c1eb65071479bcf6f3ba1edcdb187b9a09f15ea81d526b964c3a6f414c7a4561.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.   Major components.  

Discussions with the student regarding the different types  of main rotor systems can be accomplished with additional  manufacturer drawings. Pay particular attention to the type  of main rotor system that the student will be flying. By now,  the student probably has read about the different types of  rotor systems but may not fully understand the differences.  Explain to the student identifiable characteristics of each  rotor system that make it different from the other system  types. Also, be ready to answer the student’s questions about  the advantages and disadvantages of each type of system,  cost, and maintenance requirements versus ride quality,  performance, reliability, and durability.  

# Rigid Rotor System  

When introducing the rigid rotor system, instructors should  explain that the system is mechanically simple, but structurally  complex because operating loads must be absorbed in  bending rather than through hinges.  [Figures 5-3  and  5-4] The rigid rotor was developed by Irven Culver (1911 to 1999)  of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to bring the simplicity of  fixed-wing flight to helicopters. In a rigid rotor system, the  blades, hub, and mast are rigid with respect to each other.  The rigid rotor system is mechanically simpler than the fully  articulated rotor system. There are no vertical or horizontal  hinges so the blades cannot flap or drag, but they can be  feathered. Operating loads from flapping and lead/lag forces  must be absorbed by bending rather than through hinges.  By flexing, the blades themselves compensate for the forces  that previously required rugged hinges. The result is a rotor  system that has less lag in the control response because the  rotor has much less oscillation. The rigid rotor system also  negates the danger of mast bumping inherent in semirigid  rotors. The rigid rotor can also be called a hingeless rotor.  

Explain the other advantages of the rigid rotor system to the  student (e.g., a reduction in the weight and drag of the rotor  hub, higher control loads). Without the complex hinges, this  rotor system is much more reliable and easier to maintain than  the other rotor configurations. Rigid rotor systems require  flexible rotor blades to produce a tolerable ride quality, but  allow better maneuverability.  

# Semirigid Rotor System  

Discuss with the student the main parts of the semirigid rotor  system. Explain that it was named for its lack of the lead- lag hinge that a fully articulated rotor system has. The rotor  system can be said to be rigid in plane because the blades  are not free to lead and lag; however, they are not rigid in the  flapping plane (through the use of a teeter hinge). Therefore,  the rotor is not rigid, but not fully articulated either; it is  

![](images/d15de5418da689ddf13a180c943d30ddfe617908566360d3249b43d8b130f847.jpg)

Figure 5-4.   Main rotor blade attachment joint on rigid main rotor system.  

semirigid. The parts of the semirigid rotor system that should  be identified are teeter hinge, blade grip, blade pitch change  horn, and pitch link. (NOTE: The swashplate assembly is  described on page 5-12.)  

Also, discus the difference between teetering (flapping)  versus feathering. On any rotor system, flapping occurs when  the blade moves up and down. On a rigid rotor system, this  occurs when the blade bends. On an articulated system, the  blade flaps up and down around a teetering hinge. On a two- bladed, semirigid teetering system, the blades flap in unison  around the flapping hinge, such as in a Bell 206.The semirigid  main rotor system is designed such that as the blades cone and  flap for different airspeeds, the rotor blade center of gravity  centers around the teetering hinge such that the flap down is  mostly cancelled out by flap of the other side.  

Examples of the semirigid rotor system are found on the  Bell 230, the Bell 222  [Figures 5-5, 5-6,  and  5-7],  and the  Bell 206.  [Figure 5-8]  Point out to the student that the Bell  206 head does not include coning hinges. Instead, the rotor  head is designed with a pre-cone angle to the blade retention  system, and other coning forces are simply dealt with by  bending of the blades.  

![](images/2d0d8ebf2f48bde85fa707f48bb1e837f5d3e2871191e1bdcf201c9f0b92ce71.jpg)

Figure 5-8.   Bell 206 semirigid rotor system.  

When discussing the semirigid rotor system, instructors  should explain that some are designed with an underslung  rotor system which mitigates the lead/lag forces by mounting  the blades slightly lower than the usual plane of rotation so  the lead and lag forces are minimized. As the blades cone  upward, the center of pressure of the blades are almost in the  same plane as the hub. Further explain that if the semirigid  rotor system is an underslung rotor, the center of gravity  (CG) is below the mast attachment point. This underslung  mounting is designed to align the blade’s center of mass  with a common flapping hinge so that both blades’ centers  of mass vary equally in distance from the center of rotation  during flapping. The rotational speed of the system tends  to change, but this is restrained by the inertia of the engine  and flexibility of the drive system. Only a moderate amount  of stiffening at the blade root is necessary to handle this  restriction. Simply put, underslinging effectively eliminates  geometric imbalance.  

# Fully Articulated Rotor System  

Fully articulated rotor systems can accommodate larger loads  and faster airspeeds with good ride quality. Because there are  more blades, the load can be spread among them resulting  in lower initial angle of attacks which allows the retreating  blade more margin above stall which allows increased  forward airspeed before  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  . They have increased expenses  due to the many parts that make up the rotor system, which  also make preflight more complicated. The fully articulated  rotor system is also susceptible of ground resonance if certain  factors coincide. As with the other types of rotor systems,  the student should have read about the fully articulated rotor  system.  [Figure 5-9]  The student should be able to use the  solidity ratio to explain how each blade carries only a portion  of the total load. It is about the wing loading (in pounds)  to the total area of the wing (in square feet). The instructor  may need to review with the student basic aerodynamics of  airfoils and airflows necessary to develop lift. Full articulation  is also found on rotor systems with more than two blades.  Using the rotor, show the student how the fully articulated  system allows each blade to lead and lag, flap up and down,  and feather.  [Figure 5-10]  

The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to absorb the  acceleration and deceleration of the rotor blades caused by  Coriolis Effect.  [Figure 5-11]  Older hinge designs relied  on conventional metal bearings. By basic geometry, this  precludes a coincidental flapping and lead/lag hinge and is  cause for recurring maintenance. Newer rotor systems use  elastomeric bearings, arrangements of rubber and steel that  can permit motion in two axes. Other than solving some of the  above-mentioned kinematic issues, these bearings are usually  in compression, can be readily inspected, and eliminate the  maintenance associated with metallic bearings.  

![](images/e1c4bbc8e309b0271a89126082ce753f8c4b71060e0023e3abb861d4acee57f6.jpg)  
Figure 5-10.   Fully articulated rotor system.  

Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear  is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older  bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this  design.  

![](images/c45a0586c7ba09c586115f8beb2a331a2e850aa828701f5b606c9f2a8a1e1ec3.jpg)  
Figure 5-9.   Bell 427 fully articulated rotor system. This system is often referred to as soft in plane; each blade operates independently  and leads, lags, and flaps in a controlled manner due to elastomeric construction.  

![](images/50412c7e6293478f705dce7163e10c4d84964d32c87ef48494aabade8ad091a3.jpg)  
Figure 5-11.   Lead/lag hinge allows the rotor blade to move back  and forth in plane.  

Coning or flapping hinges-allows the blades to flap up and  as airspeed is increased, allows the main rotor blades to flap  due to differences in the relative wind speeds.  [Figure 5-11]  

Feathering hinges allow the main rotor system blades to  change pitch individually as they cycle around the rotor disk  to allow for direction thrust control application.  

This is a good time to reiterate to the student what was  covered in the Helicopter Flying Handbook, Chapter 4,  Helicopter Flight Controls, and how each input from the  controls (cyclic and collective) independently or collectively  affects the rotor system.  

Figures 5-10  and  5-11  depict how the blade acts in its  rotation about the mast. Explain to the student that the blade  is normally kept in a horizontal plane during its rotation by  centrifugal force. However, high winds during runup or  shutdown when the blades are turning at a low speed could  affect this (and cause damage as well). The damage occurs  when the blades flex up or down greater than normal. Another  factor to consider is how the flapping force is affected by the  severe rigor of the maneuver (rate of climb, forward speed,  aircraft gross weight, hard landing, etc.).  

Coning or flapping hinges allow the blades to flap up and  as airspeed is increased, allows the main rotor blades to flap  due to differences in the relative wind speeds. The feathering  hinges allow the main rotor system blades to change pitch  individually as they cycle around the rotor disk to allow for  direction thrust control application.  

Explain to the student that modern rotor systems may use the  combined principles of the rotor systems mentioned above.  Some rotor hubs incorporate a flexible hub, which allows the  blade to bend (flex) without the need for bearings or hinges.  These systems, called flextures, are usually constructed from  composite material. Elastomeric bearings may also be used  in place of conventional roller bearings. Elastomeric bearings  are constructed from a rubber-type material and have limited  movement that is perfectly suited for helicopter applications.  Flextures and elastomeric bearings require no lubrication  and, therefore, require less maintenance. They also absorb  vibration, which means less fatigue and longer service life  for the helicopter components.  

# Bearingless Rotor System  

When discussing the bearingless rotor system, explain to  the student how the structures of the blades and hub are  manufactured differently to absorb stresses. Bearingless  rotor systems, such as the Eurocopter systems, have contact  surfaces or load points made of elastomeric composite  components that deform and twist to allow blade movement.  Most of these components are “on condition” life items  versus metal components which must be changed at certain  times due to metal fatigue. The composite components are  designed so that even if a portion fails, the aircraft can make  a safe landing.  [Figure 5-12]  

The hingeless (bearingless) rotor system functions much as  the articulated system does, but uses elastomeric bearings  and composite flextures to allow flapping and lead lag  movements of the blades in place of conventional hinges.  Its advantages are improved control response with less  lag and substantial improvements in vibration control. It  does not have the risk of ground resonance associated with  the articulated type unless the landing gear system needs  servicing. The hingeless rotor system is also considerably  a more expensive system.  

# Tandem Rotor  

On a tandem rotor helicopter, two rotors turn in opposite  directions at opposite ends of a long hull. The rotors are  usually synchronized through a transmission system so that  the main rotor shafts can be little more than a blade length  apart. Tandem rotor helicopters operate a little differently  from the single rotor variety. Tandem rotor helicopters have  no tail rotor, so there is no translating tendency to combat, but  there are pedals for directional control at a hover. The cyclic  control, which is used as it always has been in single rotor  helicopters, has not changed either.  [Figure 5-13]  

One deviation to the tandem rotor system is the side-by-side  twin rotor system.  Figure 5-14  shows an example of the  Kamen K-Max intermeshing (side-by-side) rotor system,  which dates back to the old H-4 Husky, and is a modified  tandem rotor system. It is optimized for external load  

![](images/bdee6e5b1a7f6793782c29c0e32f49ed04fb1d202fd6a1dc7829990b440384a8.jpg)

operations, and is able to lift a payload of over 6,000 pounds,  which is more than the helicopter's empty weight. The  K-MAX relies on the two primary advantages of synchropter  over conventional helicopters: 1) it is the most efficient of  any rotor-lift technology, and 2) it has a natural tendency to  hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work  in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter  is more responsive to pilot control inputs, making it easily  possible to sling a load thus to scatter seed, chemicals, or  water over a larger area.  

# Coaxial Rotor System  

Students should be shown the Coaxial rotor system, which  consists of a pair of helicopter rotors mounted one above the  other on concentric shafts, that is one shaft inside another  with the same axis of rotation, but that turn in opposite  directions.  [Figure 5-15]  Explain that this configuration  is a feature of helicopters produced by the Russian Kamov  helicopter design bureau. Coaxial rotors solve the problem of  angular momentum by turning each set of rotors in opposite  directions. The equal and opposite torques from the rotors  

![](images/56c63f88c290736de5e2f57457657a9da8e820f5aaf7964c760a6d3eb6fa7ba6.jpg)  
Figure 5-14.  Kaman K-Max with the modified tandem rotor system.  

upon the body cancel out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw  control, is accomplished by increasing the collective pitch  of one rotor and decreasing the collective pitch on the other.  This causes a controlled differential of torque.  

Coaxial rotors reduce the effects of dissymmetry of lift  through the use of two rotors turning in opposite directions,  causing blades to advance on either side at the same time.  One other benefit arising from a coaxial design include  increased payload for the same engine power. A tail rotor  typically wastes some of the power that would otherwise be  devoted to lift and thrust; all of the available engine power in  a coaxial rotor design is devoted to lift and thrust. Reduced  noise is a second advantage of the configuration. Part of the  loud slapping noise associated with conventional helicopters  arises from interaction between the airflows from the main  and tail rotors, which in the case of some designs can be  severe. Also, helicopters using coaxial rotors tend to be more  compact (occupying a smaller ‘footprint’ on the ground)  and consequently have uses in areas where space is at a  premium. Another benefit is increased safety on the ground;  by eliminating the tail rotor, the major source of injuries and  fatalities to ground crews and bystanders is eliminated.  

The coaxial rotor system has the following disadvantages:  

1.	 Mechanical complexity. 2.	 Poor hover performance characteristics of the smaller  rotor disk in higher altitudes and warmer climates.  3.	 Heavier, stiffer blades required to prevent the blades  from flexing into the other rotor rotating in the  opposite direction.  4.	 Heavier rotor head and hub components to control and  retain the heavier blades.  

# Swashplate Assembly  

Explain to the student that the rotating swashplate couples  stationary cyclic motion with rotating cyclic control  

![](images/c71057eee26c9caa17a6628b980c6176c871e179987d4ef461f903a710d496d2.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  A Kamov Ka-32A-12 has a coaxial rotor system.  

movements. The drive link ensures that the rotating swashplate  stays synchronized with the main rotor as it turns. The antidrive  link and lever are attached to the aft side of the inner ring and  swashplate support, preventing rotation of the inner ring. Point  out to the student where these controls are connected. Also,  point out (if installed) the stationary swashplate, rotating  swashplate, pushrods, antidrive link, uniball, and pitch horns.  [Figure 5-16]  During preflight inspect for obvious damage,  condition, and security of all components.  

![](images/8542db16bd1560389c5ca6c67687ca20e4e2dc61f1bd09cadfd138235bc940c2.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.   Stationary and rotating swashplates.  

Explain to the student that there are several different  mechanisms for transmitting cyclic and collective inputs  to the main rotor system. The Robinson R22 and R44  have the swashplate mounted on a monoball. This allows  the entire swashplate to slide up and down on the rotor  mast (for collective inputs) and tilt (for cyclic inputs).  Figure 5-17  shows how the swashplate slides up and down  to transmit a collective pitch change.  Figures 5-17  and  5-18 should be used by the instructor as references. Demonstrating  to the student the actual movements on the helicopter is a  better option, if available.  

Figure 5-17  depicts how collective inputs affect the  swashplate assembly. The red arrow is pointing to the bottom  of the swashplate (A), B shows the entire swashplate has  moved up the mast. Note the effect on the pitch links.  

Small hashed lines show that in B, the pitch link has moved  up along with the swashplate (compare the top of the pitch  link and the left-hand coning hinge bolt in the two pictures).  Since the entire swashplate has moved up without changing  its tilt, the pitch links have all moved up a set amount, but  continue to move up and down during rotation in response  to the tilt of the swashplate.  

Figure 5-18  depicts how the cyclic inputs affect the  swashplate assembly. Notice that the swashplate in A is  basically level, while in B it has been tilted. The tilt forces  the pitch link to move up as it travels to the right-hand side  of the picture, and move back down as it travels to the left-  hand side of the picture. As it moves up and down, the blade  pitch increases and decreases.  

NOTE: On some helicopters, the control rods were routed  internally up through the main rotor mast to protect them.  On those helicopters, the cyclic inputs come down from the  top of the mast and the swashplate is under the transmission,  where it is all covered and protected from wires (Enstrom).

# Antitorque Systems  

# Tail Rotor  

Explain to the student that the tail rotor is required on a single  rotor helicopter to overcome the torque effect. This torque  effect is the result of the fuselage turning in the opposite  direction of the main rotor system.  Figure 5-19  depicts the  main rotor blades turning counterclockwise and the fuselage  (torque direction) turning clockwise in order to compensate  for the unwanted torque of the fuselage. On a static aircraft,  show the student how the inputs of antitorque pedals effect  the pitch change in the tail rotor. Discuss with the student the  emergency procedures for loss of tail rotor authority, loss of  tail rotor thrust, loss of tail rotor components (forward CG  shift), a break in the tail rotor drive system, and fixed pitch  settings.  

![](images/2e4122132052d3b6588470edbc7cbdbdf4d68fb1dfa9a085d5fc22e131a56648.jpg)  
Figure 5-19.   Antitorque rotor produces thrust to oppose torque.  

Point out to the student the different parts of the tail rotor  (if installed), including the pitch change tube, pitch change  link, and the cross head assembly.  [Figure 5-20]  The Bell  model 427 tail rotor assembly shown in Figure 5-20 has an  internal control rod which is designed this way for protection.  Demonstrate that as the crosshead assembly moves in and out,  it will change the pitch angle of the tail rotor blades via the  pitch change link and pitch horns. When left pedal is applied,  control tubes are moved and the lever assembly retracts the  control tube. As the control tube retracts, the crosshead moves  closer to the yoke assembly; tail rotor blade pitch is increased.  

Show how the tail rotor is much like the main rotor, except it  is turned on its side and provides thrust instead of lift. Another  way to describe the tail rotor is to compare it to an airplane  propeller which also generates thrust and does not provide  lift. Reinforce to the student the importance of keeping the  antitorque pedals free of obstructions and having full range of  movement. Emphasize that if a loose object fell during flight  and were not retrieved, it could jam the pedals and reduce  aircraft controllability.  

# Other Types of Antitorque System  

Explain to the student that there are several different types  of anti-torque systems. One is the fenestron, or “fan-in- tail,” design. A fenestron is a fully enclosed tail rotor. It is  essentially a ducted fan. The housing is integral with the  tail skin, and, like the conventional tail rotor it replaces, is  intended to counteract the torque of the main rotor. Fenestrons  have between eight and eighteen blades. These may have  variable angular spacing so that the noise is distributed  over different frequencies and, thus, is quieter. The housing  allows a higher rotational speed than a conventional rotor,  

![](images/bc1af35877c4882e186d4ba7cc64aceba71305e630f72025a58cc57312f62b77.jpg)  
Figure 5-20.   Bell model 427 tail rotor assembly.  

allowing it to have smaller blades.  [Figure 5-21]  The smaller  diameter allows use of higher fan speeds and sometimes  requires higher fan rpm ranges to equal thrust from a much  larger unducted system. The housing, although somewhat  heavier, does offer some protection on the ground and is  more streamlined in forward flight. Discuss with the student  that propellers and rotors alike are designed to be less than  transonic at the tips.

Figure 5-21.   Fenestron, or “fan-in-tail,” antitorque system. This  design provides an improved margin of safety during ground  operations.  

The other type of tail rotor is the NOTAR  $^\mathrm{\textregistered}$   system (no tail  rotor). The NOTAR system represents the first significant  configuration change to conventional helicopters since 1939  when Igor Sikorsky flew the first conventional rotorcraft.  "The new system uses the Coanda effect of air flowing over  or around the surface of the tail boom to create lateral lift.  This counteracts the torque of the main rotor. The NOTAR  system shortens drive shafts, gearboxes, and the rotor unit  itself. This reduction in the parts count is a distinct advantage  over conventional tail rotor craft.  [Figure 5-22]  

![](images/7d6163ca5a6689135e4a897218c92c469f2c064ab44b154ab632ade1bf60f9f4.jpg)  
Figure 5-22.   The Coanda effect supplies approximately two-thirds  of the lift necessary to maintain directional control in a hover. The  remaining lift is created by directing the thrust from the controllable  rotating nozzle.  

In operation, the NOTAR system draws low-pressure air in  through an air intake located at the top of the airframe to the  rear of the main rotor shaft. A variable-pitch fan pressurized  the tail boom to a relatively constant 0,5 psi. The air is fed  to two starboard side slots and a direct jet thruster. The slots  provide the necessary antitorque force. The rotating jet  thruster provides direction control. The two slots are located  at 70 and 140 degrees and allow ejected air to mix with the  main rotor downwash to establish the Coanda effect. The  main rotor downwash is normally dissipated as essentially  symmetric separation on both sides of the tail boom in a  hover. The pressurized boom inject low-pressure air at 250  fps onto the Coanda surface (outer surface of the tail boom),  which results in the deflection and produces about two-thirds  of the required antitorque force. This force is predictable. It is  controlled by the appropriate location of the slot and control  of the air jet that exits from the slot.  

In other words, the tail boom reacts like an airplane wing,  only sideways. The increased air speed over the starboard  side of the tail boom causes lateral lift, pushing against the  torque forces trying to spin the helicopter clockwise. This is  the same result that a tail rotor achieves when it propels the  tail in a counterclockwise motion.  

The main rotor downwash skews as velocity is increased,  and the circulation control slot is uncovered, resulting in  proportional loss of antitorque force. The vertical tail surface  provides the directional stability with forward speed. In  sideward flight, the effective angle of attack is changed as  a function of the main rotor thrust and sideward velocity  inflow effects. When the downwash is altered by motion  other than hovering, the system reduces the Coanda effect,  and the thruster picks up more of the load. This keeps the  system forces balanced. The tail fin, which does not come  into play when hovering, also becomes effective when  flying forward.  

The direct thruster provides the remaining one-third of the  force needed to counter the torque of the main rotor. The  thruster rotates, moving the opening either to the right or  left. In this way, directional control is achieved.  

# Engines  

Discuss the different types of engine that may be found  on most modern helicopters: reciprocating (or piston)  and turbine. Discuss with the student the emergency  procedures for engine related problems, such as loss of power  (underspeed) or rapid increase in power (overspeed) while in  flight. Authorized fuel types for a specific engine should also  be topics of discussion at this time.  

# Reciprocating Engine (Piston)  

Explain that the reciprocating engine is the most widely used  powerplant in light helicopters and is designed to specific  standards of reliability. It must be capable of sustained high  power output for long periods. Explain to the student the  cycle of the reciprocating engine, as depicted in  Figure 5-23 Discuss the intake cycle (induction stroke, fuel/air mixture),  compression cycle (fuel/air mixture ignited by spark plug),  power cycle (burning mixture expands), and the exhaust  cycle (burned gases escape). The manufacturer may be  able to provide a diagram of the internal components of the  reciprocating engine. This allows further discussion with the  student of the internal workings of the engine.  

It is very important for instructors to teach the student to  understand what the engine is supposed to do, how it works  while flying and what happens when something breaks and  how the pilot should react. The instructor should be able to  discuss the octane requirements of a gasoline engine or jet  fuel classifications if teaching in a turbine engine powered  machine. Some engines require the settings to be changed  for different fuels. The instructor must ensure the student  can determine the difference between jet fuel and avgas  when sumping the tanks. Explain that besides smell and the  oiliness tests, there is the white paper test, where a drop is  placed on a piece of white paper or paper towel. Avgas will  leave a distinctive ring from the dye in the fuel whereas jet  fuel tends to leave an oily yellow ring.  

# Turbine Engine  

Explain to the student that the turbine engine is also widely  used today on larger and most all of the military helicopters.  Because turbine engines have a continuous combustion  process which allows more horsepower to be developed  form a smaller unit. Since the power is developed from  circular rotation instead of reciprocating motion, power is  smoother and engine stresses are reduced which contributes  to reliability. The expense comes from the high temperature  tolerant materials and close-tolerance manufacturing  processes needed to produce the turbine engine. A turbine  engine provides a high power-to-weight ratio, which a  reciprocating engine cannot provide. Some have a power- to-weight ratio three times that of the piston engine.  

![](images/ff152df5b8dcb107698f62f9742dcbd1e279784ef9b578052f3582bc9f128931.jpg)  
Figure 5-23.   The arrows indicate the direction of crankshaft and piston motion during the four-stroke cycle.  

Turbocharged or supercharged piston engines can operate  well at high altitudes. Weight per horsepower and reliability  are the main factors favoring the turbine engine. Explain that  the working cycle of the turbine engine is similar to that of  the piston engine (i.e., induction, compression, combustion,  and exhaust). One other difference is the fact that the piston  engine combustion (power) is intermittent; in the turbine  engine, each process (cycle) is continuous. The manufacturer  may be able to provide a diagram of the internal components  of the turbine engine. This will allow further discussions with  the student regarding the internal workings of the engine.  Figure 5-24  is an example of a turbine engine.  

The instructor should also explain the increased fuel usage in  a turbine engine is due to the continuous combustion process  and the fact that approximately the first 50-60 percent of the  engine’s power is required to sustain the engine’s induction  and systems such as the oil system and electrical generator.  This accounts for a turbine engines high idle speed. A turbine  engine may idle at   $16{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$   and generate maximum  power at   $38{,}000\ \mathrm{rpm}$  . Turbine engine power curves are  very steep and it may need 6-10 seconds or longer to begin  generating large increased power demands. There is very  little extra power available at close to idle settings from  turbines. Usually, turbine engines must be above   $80.90\%$  rpm to develop moderate power output. This is the reason to  keep turbine engines under power loads to have the power  available if needed.  

Show the student the main parts of the turbine engine  (compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and accessory  gearbox assembly). Then, discuss what each section is  doing during flight or 100 percent power, as depicted in  Figure 5-24 . Many helicopters use a turboshaft engine to  drive the main transmission and rotor systems. The main  difference between a turboshaft and a turbojet engine is  that most of the energy produced by the expanding gases  is used to drive a turbine (turboshaft engine) rather than  producing thrust through the expulsion of exhaust gases  (turbojet engine). The instructor should fully understand and  be able to explain that the turbine and four-stroke helicopter  engines both have four cycles: intake, compression, power,  and exhaust. This continuous combustion process is the main  limitation due to material limitations. The extreme heat and  centrifugal forces place tremendous stress on the rotating  parts of the combustion section.  

When operating helicopters with turbine engines, instructors  should teach the student about starting batteries and the  different characteristics of a lead acid and Ni-cad (nickel- cadmium) batteries. Lead acid batteries generally do not  have the energy density per pound of the Ni-cad batteries,  but cost much less and have much lower maintenance costs.  Lead acid batteries also tend to have a sloping power output  curve that can allow the operator to perceive impending  failure and replace the battery; however, lead acid batteries  must be specially designed to withstand the deep charge that  happens during a turbine engine start. The student should  be reminded of the differences between the start times of  a reciprocating engine (a relatively short period of time)  and the prolonged turbine starting sequence (lasting 30–60  seconds not counting a cooling period if the internal engine  

![](images/37db592438b58dd6534b605d4b83e6a700081ec40686dc5c74778c2cfa4aea55.jpg)  
Figure 5-24.   Turbine engine.  

temperatures are initially too high). Additionally, the battery  for a turbine engine installation must be designed with  sufficient residual reserve to furnish cooling rotation in the  event of an aborted or hot start.  

Ni-cad batteries have much higher energy densities for their  weight and, most significantly, can withstand the long, very  high current drain necessary to start a turbine engine in  cold temperatures. One advantage of Ni-cad batteries is the  almost flat output power curve. The uniform output provides  consistent turbine starter activation. Unfortunately, Ni-cad  batteries produce a very flat consistent discharge power  output which suddenly and rapidly decreases at the end  of its charge, and this means that it can be very difficult to  determine if the battery is at full capacity or towards the end  of the charge curve.  

To receive proper service and consistent turbine starts,  battery voltage and battery charge indications must be closely  and consistently monitored for long-term, gradual changes  and be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s  recommendations. This usually requires completely  discharging and charging the individual battery cells. Most  manufacturers then require that batteries be reassembled with  equal output cells for best results. For more information on  starter batteries, the instructor should review chapter 10 of  the Aviation Maintenance Technician—General Handbook.  

# As a reminder:  

1.	 The compressor draws air into the plenum chamber  and compresses it. 2.	 That air is directed to the combustion section where  fuel is injected into it. 3.	 The fuel-air mixture is ignited and allowed to expand. 4.	 This combustion gas is then forced through a series  of turbine wheels, causing them to turn. 5.	 Turbine wheels provide power to both the engine  compressor and the accessory gearbox. 6.	 Power is provided to the main rotor and tail rotor  systems through the freewheeling unit, which is  attached to the accessory gearbox power output gear  shaft. 7.	 During the starting process, follow the manufacturer’s  requirements closely for hot or slow starting  procedures. A fully charged battery will help in most  cases. 8.	 Always follow the manufacturer’s cool down  procedures to allow internal parts to settle to cooler  uniform temperatures as much as possible before  engine shut off.  

Now, briefly explain what each section comprises and any  emergency actions related to each one.  

# Compressor  

The compressor is similar to a fan. As air is drawn inward,  stator vanes act as a diffuser at each stage, decreasing air  velocity and increasing air pressure. The high pressure air  then passes through the compressor manifold where it is  distributed to the combustion chamber via discharge tubes.  

Discuss with the student the phenomenon of a compressor  stall (engine surges). Explain to the student how reducing the  airflow might correct the condition. This is accomplished by  activating the bleed air system, which vents excess pressure to  the atmosphere and allows a larger volume of air to enter the  compressor to unstall the compressor blades. Help the student  understand the compressor air control system installed in the  helicopter and explain the probable failure modes. If the inlet  guide vanes fail closed or if a bleed air valve fails open, the  pilot will notice much higher engine combustion temperatures  at lower power settings with the maximum power available  being very limited. If the guide vanes fail open or the bleed  air valves fail closed, high power operations will probably be  normal but compressor stalling and possible flameouts may  occur as the power demand is reduced.  

# Combustion Chamber  

The combustion chamber is where the fire takes place anytime  the engine is running properly. An igniter plug connected to  the combustion chamber ignites the fuel/air mixture only when  starting the engine. If installed with an auto-relight, the igniter  may attempt to automatically relight the fuel/air mixture in  an engine flame-out condition. Discuss with the student what  is done if the engine should flame out during flight. Altitude  and time available should be mentioned as well.  

# Turbine  

Discussions about the turbine need to be tailored to the specific  helicopter that is being flown as each there are differences  in how the two sections of the turbine are coupled to the  drive line. For example, the Rolls-Royce (formerly Allison)  (Bell JetRanger and BO-105), Lycoming engines (Astars),  and Pratt and Whitney (BH-212) are free turbine engines  with separate shafts for compressors and power turbines.  Older Gazelle and Alouettes use a single-shaft turbine with  a centrifugal clutch to allow starting, much like the older  and often larger reciprocating-engine-powered helicopters.  Turbines will always have the two sections of compression  and combustion. What varies is how the sections are coupled  to the drive line. Common in most helicopters now is the  free turbine design, which uses one inner shaft from the  combustion section turbine to drive the accessory gearbox,  oil pump, fuel pump, starter/generator and the compressor  to sustain the engine. This is typically called the N1(NG).  A separate outer shaft around the inner shaft driven by the  power output turbine wheel usually goes through the gearbox  to be reduced in rpm and support the output drive shaft. This  is typically called the N2 and is dedicated to driving the main  rotor, tail rotor, drive system, and other accessories such as  generators, alternators, and air conditioning (if installed).  

Help the student correlate possible emergencies, such as  NR/NG overspeeds, to what is happening in the turbine  and ensure that the student understand why the steps being  taken for the emergency procedures help alleviate or control  the problem so that they can safely land the helicopter.  Memorizing emergency procedures is part of the beginning  learning process for students, but the ultimate goal should  be to help them recognize the onset of a system/component  failure and then how to properly react to ensure a safe landing.  

# Transmission System  

Explain to the student the purpose of the transmission system.  It transfers the work done by the engine to the main rotor,  tail rotor, and other components of the helicopter that rely  on engine propulsion. Discuss the main components of the  transmission and where they are located on the helicopter:  

1.	 Main rotor transmission 2.	 Antitorque drive system 3.	 Clutch 4.	 Freewheeling unit 5.	 Rotor brake (if installed)  

Point out the location of the oil level sight gauge. Also, point  out the location of chip detectors that are associated with the  transmission and engine (if detectors are installed). Identify the  location of the warning lights on the pilot’s instrument panel.  

Chip detectors give advance warning of possible excessive  engine or transmission wear, which could prevent an  impending failure. This early warning can also greatly  reduce the cost of engine and transmission overhaul. The  chip detectors illuminate warning light(s) when metal chips  bridge the gap in the magnetic probe of the chip detector.  

NOTE: Some helicopters use chip detectors that have burn-  off capability (fuzz burners). When a metal chip(s) bridge the  gap in the magnetic probe a warning light is illuminated on  the instrument panel. The chip(s) are automatically charged  with an electrical current with the ability to eliminate most  small particles.  

# Main Rotor Transmission  

Explain to the student that the main rotor transmission is  designed as a gear reduction, reducing engine power to rotor  revolutions per minute (rpm). With a horizontally mounted  engine, the transmission changes the axis of rotation from the  horizontally mounted engine to the vertical axis of the rotor  shaft. In many helicopters, the transmission also supports or  carries the entire weight of the helicopter. Because of this,  the transmission brackets should be checked on preflight for  stability and condition.  

Explain to the student that the rotor rpm is kept at a  predetermined setting during normal flight. During  autorotation, the rotor rpm must be maintained by the pilot  to continue a normal rate of descent. Remember, very low  rotor rpm is unrecoverable as the blades will fold up and  airflow will not increase the rpm.  

Discuss with the student that a high rotor rpm during  autorotation increases the rate of descent. Low rotor rpm  initially slows the rate of descent; however, if rpm is  allowed to decrease excessively, the helicopter may fall  almost vertically. Little or no collective is available at the  bottom of the autorotation. Maintaining the autorotation  rpm that is set by the helicopter manufacturer is important.  Figure 5-25  depicts various types of tachometer used to  maintain/monitor the rotor rpm.  

![](images/8cafad61ebc2b4d843550deecb9da6f568c1de760345535635b7783ed5e37195.jpg)  
Figure 5-25.   There are various types of duel-needle tachometers;  however, when the needles are superimposed or joined, the engine  rpm ratio is the same as the gear reduction ratio.  

# Antitorque Drive System  

Explain to the student that the drive system may be exposed or  placed inside of a covered tail boom depending on the type of  helicopter. Point out to the student the different parts of the tail  rotor drive system, (if installed) such as the hanger bearings,  flex couplings, input seal, and output seal. Also, point out  what to look for during preflight (leaks, loose fittings, or  obvious damage). The instructor should ensure the student  understands the common failure modes and weak links. For  example, the witness pins on the shafts at the couplings,  coupling packs, slippage marks, and metal particles indicating  a movement between the surfaces (around a loose rivet). The  tail rotor gear box should also be covered at this time. Fluid  levels and attaching hardware are important preflight items  to check.  [Figure 5-26]  

![](images/9fc7d434bf6b8f8f530b06bf944988fd1a4a0a7102bdadb94750ec2175709e17.jpg)  
Figure 5-26.   Tail rotor and tail gearbox of a Robinson 22.  

# Clutch  

Explain to the student the purpose of the clutch (if installed)  on the helicopter, and how a centrifugal clutch works. A  centrifugal clutch is a clutch that uses centrifugal force to  connect two concentric shafts, with the driving shaft nested  inside the driven shaft. The input of the clutch is connected  to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft,  chain, or belt. As engine rpm increases, weighted arms in  the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage.  The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially  mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On  the center shaft, there are assorted extension springs, which  connect to a clutch shoe. When the center shaft spins fast  enough, the springs extend, causing the clutch shoes to  engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake  in reverse. When the engine reaches a certain rpm, the clutch  activates, working. This results in waste heat but, over a broad  range of speeds, it is much more useful than a direct drive in  many applications. Those using the belt clutch system must  be very careful to ensure full engagement and engagement  procedures. Excessive throttle can quickly ruin an engine  because there is no load during the initial starting, so the  engine can speed past its rpm redlines very quickly. Those  events require expensive teardowns and overhauls. Most  large helicopters use a clutch during the start sequence and  then gradually engage the rotor system to normal operating  rpm.  

Free-turbine engines do not need a clutch because there is  little load from the rotor system. The rotor slowly starts  turning during the start sequence and gradually achieves  normal operating rpm.  

Explain to the student that there are three main types of clutch  found on reciprocating helicopters.  

1.	 Centrifugal clutch—briefly explain how the centrifugal  clutch operates and how to determine if the clutch is  operating normally, using the rotor tachometer. 2.	 Belt drive clutch—briefly explain how the belt drive  clutch operates and how to determine if the clutch is  operating normally using the rotor tachometer. Show  the student the location of the pulley belts and that  the pilot must check for frays, tears, or cracks on the  belt(s) during preflight of the helicopter. 3.	 Sprag clutch—explain how the sprag clutches have  inclined ramps and rollers. If the drive shaft is faster  than the driven shaft, the rollers are forced against the  ramps and the clutch locks up and transmits full power.  If the driven shaft is turning faster than the driving  shaft, the rollers retreat down the incline and allow the  driven shaft to rotate freely, hence the freewheeling  clutch.  

NOTE: A clutch is used to disconnect the engine from the  rotor load to enable a starter motor to turn the engine for  starting. Some turbine helicopters have a centrifugal clutch  (Gaszelle) that engages the rotor system above about 28,000  rpm. Also, the R-22, R-44, and HU-269 series use belt  clutches to allow the engine to be started without excessive  loading. The older Hillers and Bell 47 series machines used  centrifugal clutches mounted above the engines.  

# Freewheeling Unit  

Explain to the student that all helicopters are fitted with  a form of freewheeling unit. Also, explain the purpose  of the freewheeling unit and where it is located on the  helicopter. The freewheeling unit makes autorotations  possible by disconnecting the dead or failed powerplant  from the transmission and removing the drag from the rotor  system. One of the most popular types is the sprag clutch.  The freewheeling unit allows the engine to drive the rotors  but does not allow the rotors to turn the engine. When the  engine(s) fail, the main rotor still has a considerable amount  of inertia and still tends to turn under its own force and  through the aerodynamic force of the air through which it is  flying. The freewheeling unit is designed to allow the main  rotor to rotate now on its own regardless of engine speed. This  principle is the same as being in a car and pushing the clutch  in, or putting it into neutral while the car is still moving—the  car coasts along under its own force. This occurs regardless  of what is done to the accelerator pedal.  

# Fuel System  

Explain to the student the parts and functions of the fuel  system.  Figure 5-27  illustrates a typical gravity feed fuel  system.  

![](images/d738000177a9dbba914ea2df8605efa68b953978538383080c75124464080aaf.jpg)  
Figure 5-27.   The components of a typical gravity feed fuel system  in a helicopter with a reciprocating engine.  

Show the student how to properly check the fuel for water or  other contaminants. Also point out to the student the location  of the fuel shutoff valve in case of an emergency. If installed,  show the student how to operate the hand-operated fuel  primer and why a primer if installed for a carburetor engine  must be closed and locked for proper engine operation.  

Explain to the student the purpose and part(s) of the engine  fuel control system and the location of the system. Each type  of helicopter (reciprocating or turbine engine) requires a  different type of fuel control, and each one also has a different  type of delivery for the fuel control.  

1.	 Reciprocating engines have a carburetor or are fuel  injected. 2.	 Turbine engines have several types of fuel control  systems: a.	 Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC)— engine is electronically controlled with no  mechanical connections. Requires electricity to  fully operate and function. b.	 Mechanical Units—no power is needed, it is all  mechanical and is reliable but not as efficient. c.	 Hydro/Mechanical hybrid units have some  characteristics of both. Usually older versions  of early attempts at FADEC type systems. Many  had a manual reversion capability.  

Show the student the major components of the fuel control  system, if installed. Two types of fuel control system that  are used today by most modern turbine helicopters are the  FADEC and analog electronic engine control (EEC).  

True FADECs have no form of manual override available (in  case of FADEC failure), giving the computer full authority  over the operating parameters of the engine. If a total FADEC  failure occurs, the engine fails.  

If the engine is controlled digitally and electronically but  allows for manual override, it is considered an EEC or  electronic control unit. An EEC allows the pilot to continue to  operate the engine with the throttle while in emergency mode  (manual mode). Electronic supervisory control allows the  pilot to override the digital side of the fuel control and operate  in the analog mode during emergency mode of operations.  

NOTE: Many turbines still utilize the older type electronic  fuel control systems, which may not be quite as efficient as  the newer systems, but operate without electrical power and  are quite reliable. Manual operation is easily possible.  

# Engines  

# Reciprocating Engines Carburetor  

Explain to the student the need to make adjustments to the  carburetor (“full rich” to “leaning the mixture”) and why.  Refer the student to the FAA-approved Rotorcraft Flight  Manual (RFM) and point out the specific procedures for a  particular helicopter.  

Discuss with the student what the indications are if the fuel  mixture is too rich (engine seems rough/reduced power)  or leaned out too much (high engine temperature, possibly  damaging). The mixture in most cases should be adjusted  on the ground because an overly lean mixture can cause the  engine to stop, resulting in a forced autorotation and attempt  to restart the helicopter in flight.  

# Carburetor Ice  

Figure 5-28  depicts how ice affects the carburetor. Discuss  with the student why ice may form on the internal surfaces  of the carburetor. Carburetor ice has two sources: 1) Venturi  cooling from air expansion and 2) fuel vaporization absorbing  heat. Both effects combine to cool moisture in the air to  below freezing. In some installations, the Venturi effect can  cause icing around the butterfly in fuel injection systems, but  it is a rare instance. Recommend reviewing FAA Advisory  Circular (AC) 20-113, Pilot Precautions and Procedures  To Be Taken in Preventing Aircraft Reciprocating Engine  Induction System and Fuel System Icing Problems. Also,  discuss the indications of carburetor icing (e.g., decrease in  engine rpm or manifold pressure, carburetor air temperature  gauge outside the safe operating range, and engine roughness)  and how to correct for the icing condition.  

![](images/64503906648c0ed859af638e9621ef5d5ae346a433cdda59c93d644c3b7b6942.jpg)  
Figure 5-28.   Carburetor ice reduces the size of the air passage to  the engine, restricting the flow of the fuel/air mixture and reducing  power.  

Point out to the student the FAA-approved RFM procedure  for carburetor heat. Engine rpm should decrease as hot air is  introduced into the engine because hot air is less dense. If the  engine rpm does not decrease, the flight should be canceled  until the defect is corrected and ensure that a deficiency  entry is made into the helicopter’s logbook or maintenance  tracking sheet. Explain to the student that  Figure 5-29  is a  depiction of how a typical carburetor heat system functions.  Remind the student at this time that if too little carburetor  heat is applied and ice kills the engine, the freewheeling unit  will prevent restarts of the engine without use of the starter.  

![](images/431a7ef0c04eb050d35309d60c77979c379e6132a12a66309b092bbbf1c79cb9.jpg)  
Figure 5-29.   When the carburetor heat is turned ON, normal air  flow is blocked, and heated air from an alternate source, usually  from the exhaust manifold, flows through the filter to the carburetor.  

# Fuel Injection  

Explain to the student how the fuel injection differs from the  carburetor system and why the system eliminates carburetor  icing. When there is no carburetor, airflow is controlled by  butterfly but no need for venture because the fuel is injected  under pressure which reduces the cooling effect. Also if  the fuel is infected at the intake port of the engine, the fuel  vaporization temperature drop doesn’t enter into the situation  at all. Even if the fuel is injected at the butterfly, it vaporizes  en route to the cylinder so the temperature drop occurs inside  the warm engine where there is plenty of heat.  

# Electrical Systems  

Show the student the electrical diagram that is provided by  the helicopter manufacturer and discuss with the student the  major components and functions of the electrical system.  

Explain how each system works with one another from the  start sequence through the power off sequence (shutdown).  At a minimum, show the student the location of the following  items (if installed) and most importantly explain the function  failure modes of the various components and enough about  the locations for a thorough preflight:  

1.	 Battery 2.	 Battery switch 3.	 Starting vibrator 4.	 Ammeter (discuss how to read it and what the numbers  indicate) 5.	 Starter switch 6.	 Starter 7.	 Alternator 8.	 Alternator switch 9.	 All circuit breakers and switches (Note: FAA policy  states that if a nonessential circuit breaker pops up  or opens, do not reset in flight. If it is an essential  circuit breaker, allow one reset only. Resetting  circuit breakers could result in an in-flight fire. For  more information, refer to the Special Airworthiness  Information Bulletin, CE-10-11R1.)  

For a student flying a turbine-powered helicopter, point out  the starter/generator. A starter/generator load indicator is  often located on the pilot’s instrument panel to indicate the  condition of the starter/generator system. A turbine helicopter  pilot should fully understand the difference between a  loadmeter and an ammeter and what the indications really  mean in order to understand what the real failure is and the  correct procedure to follow.  

Flight is still possible during a total loss of electrical power,  and students should be taught to remain calm and safely land  the helicopter. The engine continues to operate normally  without electrical power. The battery, if fully charged,  provides a limited time of power for items such as radio(s).  Also, discuss the steps to take in the event of electrical circuit  breakers tripping or fuses burning out. Electrical fire in flight  should be covered as well.  

# Hydraulics  

Hydraulic systems vary slightly with different helicopter  designs. Pilots must understand the system on the specific  helicopter that is being flown. Not all helicopters rely on  hydraulic assist for the control inputs, and smaller helicopters  usually do not use hydraulics in an effort to keep total weight  of the airframe down. Larger helicopters (light to heavy)  incorporate hydraulics to overcome high control forces.  The discussion should begin with showing the student the  manufacturer’s hydraulic schematic and indicating where  the pressure and return lines are located. Walk through the  entire hydraulic system, showing the student the location  of components and explain what the basic functions are of  each component.  

# Hydraulic System Components  

Always refer to the proper Rotorcraft Flight Manual for the  specific hydraulic system that the helicopter is equipped with.  The following is a list of hydraulic system components and  their functions with which the student should be familiar.  

Hydraulic reservoir—The reservoir has three lines: overboard  scupper drain, systems return line, and the pump supply  line. The pump supply line uses both gravity feed and pump  suction to keep the hydraulic pump supplied with fluid.  The reservoir may be pressurized to prevent cavitations for  helicopters that are capable of higher altitudes and to ensure  positive control pressure. The hydraulic reservoir is usually  located higher than the hydraulic pump to ensure adequate  fluid gravity flow to the pump  and is mounted on a bracket,  which is located near the transmission. A window is provided  on the cowling for inspection of the sight glass. A sight  glass is provided to determine when the reservoir needs  servicing. Normal fluid level is indicated when hydraulic  fluid completely fills sight glass or on some helicopters, is  filled to a set level on the sight glass.  

Hydraulic pump—provides the pressure to operate the servos  and the entire system pressure is regulated by the pump via  the pressure line. If the pump is driven off the transmission  and it fails, there is usually a shear shaft which breaks to  allow the transmission to keep rotating so that the helicopter  can be landed safely. Other systems drive the pump from  the engine. An engine failure will also include a hydraulic  failure. The pilot must understand the system on the specific  helicopter being flown.  

Quick disconnects—usually seen from the cabin roof and  need to be checked for security. What is important is that the  student understands how to ensure that the quick disconnect  fittings are fully seated and locked together. The quick  disconnects located on the pressure side are where fluid  flows through from the hydraulic pump. On the return side,  the quick disconnect is the last component through which  the fluid flows before returning to the hydraulic reservoir.  These components allow maintenance to isolate the hydraulic  reservoir and pump from the hydraulic system.  

Filter bypass indicator—the pressure and return filters both  have a pressure indicator that should be checked during  preflight. When the indicator is in the reset position, it will  be flush and not seen. An extended red indicator indicates  an impending filter stoppage. The system is also affected by  low temperature, pressure surges and excessive vibration.  The red indicator pops out when a set differential pressure  across the filter is exceeded. The difference in pressure is  not the same for all helicopters; therefore, instructors should  teach students what the pressure differentials are for the  helicopter being flown. Once the red indicator pops it will  remain extended until it is reset manually. Refer the student  the proper Rotorcraft Flight Manual for reset procedures.  

Bypass check valve—the helicopter is equipped with a bypass  system and there is an obstruction in the filter causing a  pressure differential (the differential point will be different  for each hydraulic system), the bypass valve will open and  allow unfiltered fluid to flow directly to the reservoir. This  feature allows the pilot to safely land the helicopter with the  hydraulic system still working.  

Relief valve—part of the hydraulic system, and located  between the pressure and return portions of the hydraulic  system. The unit protects the system from over pressurization  in the event of a hydraulic pump malfunction.  

Solenoid valve—designed to provide pressure to the system  when it is deenergized. The solenoid valve is de-energized  when the HYD SYS switch is in the HYD SYS position or  in the event of loss of electrical power to the valve. Placing  the HYD SYS switch to the OFF position will energize the  valve and pump pressure will be blocked with the system  pressure connected back to the reservoir.  

Hydraulic system switch—located inside the cockpit. When  the hydraulic switch is placed in the HYD SYSTEM position,  the solenoid is deenergized. The solenoid is then energized  when the hydraulic switch is placed in the OFF position. This  system is a “fail safe” system which requires power to disable.  Therefore, pulling the circuit breaker for the hydraulics might  restore the system if it happens to be an electrical control  problem. If the hydraulics have failed, it is most important  for the hydraulics to be switched off to ensure the hydraulic  system does not come back online when large control forces  are being applied. A gross over controlling situation could  result which could lead to damaging the helicopter.  

Pressure manifold—a distribution point that permits  hydraulic pressure to evenly flow to all actuators.  

Pressure switch—the switch opens if the hydraulic pressure  ever becomes low. The pilot should see an indication in the  cockpit that the hydraulic pressure is low.  

External check valves—prevent reverse flow of the hydraulic  fluid from the actuator when pressure is lost. The return line  check valve permits the return fluid from the directional  control actuator to flow out of the actuator, and then pack into  the inlet port. When hydraulic pressure is lost, this type of  design permits the directional control actuator to remain full  of fluid and prevents feedback forces in the flight controls.  

Servo actuators—varies with each helicopter design, but a  common hydraulic system will have four servo actuators:  one directional, one collective, and two cyclic.  

Return manifold—fluid leaves the actuators and travels  through the return manifold and recycles through the return  filter. The fluid then passes through the quick disconnect  coupling to the hydraulic.  

# Hydraulic System Failure  

Explain to the student what the procedures are if a hydraulic  system failure occurs. Discuss with the student the difference  in control after a hydraulic system failure while at a hover or  in forward flight. Hover is difficult because of the tendency  of overcontrolling the helicopter and the stiffness of the  controls. A run-on landing is a suitable option during a  hydraulic system failure.  

NOTE: Some hydraulic systems operate at pressures  exceeding 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi). Students  should be cautioned about searching for hydraulic leaks while  the system is still under pressure. The system accumulator  can have high system pressure for long periods of time after  shutdown and if any part of the human body is exposed to  such high pressure streams, those streams can act like a needle  and puncture the skin injecting the toxic fluid into the body.  

# Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS)  

The stability augmentation system (SAS) was developed from  an earlier method which prevented the cyclic from flopping  around, force trim, which would hold the cyclic control only  in the position at which it was released. Force trim was a  passive system that simply held the cyclic in a position which  gave a control force to transitioning airplane pilots who had  become accustomed to such control forces. Students should  learn that SAS is an active stabilization system that helps  the helicopter track the position of the cyclic relative to the  horizon. Some systems are designed to use as much as   $10\%$    of the total servo travel to control the helicopter. This is  achieved automatically without inputs from the pilot; with  this type of system installed, the pilot work load is reduced.  The helicopter is a bit more stable with SAS installed, and  it dampens unwanted helicopter movement during flight  and at a hover. Instructors should show the student the SAS  actuators, which are mounted on the hydraulic servos and  are fed information from gyros that sense the: pitch, roll,  and yaw axes of rotation. Important information to relay  to the student is that the SAS requires power, both for the  stabilization platform and for the actuators. Like any other  helicopter system, they are subject to failure and instructors  need to discuss emergency actions that may be required if  the system were to fail.  

# Autopilot  

Explain to the student that the more sophisticated SASs have  additional features, such as an autopilot. As suggested, the  autopilot can perform certain duties as selected by the pilot.  Some of the basic systems perform only basic functions, such  as heading and altitude.  

Some of the advanced systems perform certain functions,  such as climb/descent rate, navigation capabilities that track  to points and some fly instrument approaches to a hover  without any additional pilot input.  

Autopilot is widely used by the United States Coast Guard  to assist in search and rescue and to recover the helicopter  during adverse weather conditions, as well as in many  turbine powered helicopters which allows for single pilot IFR  operations.. NOTE: It is important to refer to the autopilot  operating procedures located in the RFM, if autopilot is  installed.  

# Environmental Systems (Heating/Cooling)  

Explain to the student that many smaller helicopters only have  doors as part of their environmental systems. Show where  the doors will be stored and how to properly store all loose  equipment and seat belts. Once the doors are removed, stress  the importance of a clean and secure cabin. Many accidents  have occurred when objects have blown from the cabin and  damaged both the mainrotor and tailrotor. Pilots have lost  maps, charts, sunglasses, cushions, jackets etc. from the cabin  or cockpit. Flapping seatbelts can also cause unnecessary  damage to the side of the helicopter in flight.  

Show how the ram air functions and the location of any levers  that are used to control ram air. If installed, show the location  and controls of the air conditioning unit. The pilot should be  well versed in the operation and restriction of use of the air  conditioning unit. Many units are restricted from use during  takeoffs and landing due to power demands. Ensure the  student refers to the RFM for the proper operating procedures.  

Discuss the cabin heating system with the student and locate  the heater ducts and switches that control them. Piston- powered helicopters use a heat exchanger shroud around  the exhaust manifold, and turbine-powered helicopters use  a bleed air system for cabin heat. Any other systems that use  forced air or heat should be discussed at this time, such as  defog blowers for the main windscreen.  

# Anti-Icing Systems  

First and foremost, students need to understand that anti- icing is the process of protecting against the formation of  frozen contaminant, snow, ice, or slush on a surface. Icing  can occur as the helicopter sits over night or during flight. In  either case, icing becomes a hazard and if not attended to can  be disastrous. Include the following topics when discussing  anti-icing systems: engine anti-ice, carburetor icing, preflight,  and deicing.  

# Engine Anti-Ice  

Discuss with the student the importance of using the engine  anti-ice system if certain conditions are encountered and  the loss of performance when the system is in use. The  instructor should be able to explain why the engine anti-ice  decreases power so much. The following information should  be explained to the student:  

1.	 Engine anti-ice uses bleed air to heat inlet. 2.	 The bleed air exits the inlet area into the inflow which  decreases the air density due to the high temperature  air.  3.	 Although the anti-ice may keep the engine operating,  everything else is still subject to icing. Real icing  conditions dictate an immediate exit from those  conditions.  4.	 The windshield is subject to icing on the exterior and  fogging on the interior from the crew and occupants  breathing. Rarely do helicopters have windshield anti- icing or deicing certification.  

# Carburetor Icing  

Carburetor icing can occur during any phase of flight, and it  is particularly dangerous when you are using reduced power,  such as during a descent. Explain that the pilot may not notice  it during the descent until trying to add power. Teach the  student about the possible indications of carburetor icing:  decrease in engine rpm or manifold pressure, the carburetor  air temperature gauge indicating a temperature outside  the safe operating range, and engine roughness. Because  changes in rpm or manifold pressure can occur for a number  of reasons, closely check the carburetor air temperature  gauge when in possible carburetor icing conditions. Show  the student that the carburetor air temperature gauges are  marked with either a yellow or green caution operating arc.  Instructors should refer the student to the FAA-Approved  RFM for the specific procedure regarding when and how  to apply carburetor heat. In most cases, you should keep  the needle out of the yellow arc or in the green arc. This  is accomplished by using a carburetor heat system, which  eliminates the ice by routing air across a heat source, such as  an exhaust manifold, before it enters the carburetor.  

# Preflight and Deicing  

Instructors should stress the importance of checking for  fuselage and component icing when doing the preflight with  the student. Rotorblades, pitot tubes, and engine parts are all  susceptible to icing and should be checked thoroughly before  starting the helicopter. Explain that de-icing is the process  of removing frozen contaminant, snow, ice, slush, from a  surface. Deicing of the helicopter fuselage and rotor blades  is critical prior to starting. If possible, show the student a  helicopter that has been sheltered from the elements and  then compare it to one that has not. Helicopters that are  unsheltered by hangars are subject to frost, snow, freezing  drizzle, and freezing rain all of which can cause icing of  rotor blades and fuselages, rendering them unairworthy until  cleaned. Asymmetrical shedding of ice from the blades can  lead to component failure and shedding ice can be dangerous  because it could hit any structures or people that are around  the helicopter. The tail rotor is vulnerable to shedding ice  damage. Thorough preflight checks should be made before  starting the rotor blades. If any ice was removed prior to  starting, ensure that the flight controls move freely. While  inflight, deicing systems (i.e., helicopters so equipped) should  be activated immediately after entry into an icing condition.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Always supervise the student when first introduced to  the helicopter.  [Figure 5-31] •	 Point out to the student the danger areas and the sharp  portions of the helicopter. •	 Show the student the “No Step” areas, if present. •	 Allow the student to touch each component of the  helicopter as it introduced and say the name of the  part. On the next preflight, the student should begin  to describe the function of each part, and on every  preflight after that, the student should be asked the next  component or components in order of the checklist  until the student has learned the functions of each  component of that specific helicopter. •	 If appropriate, tell the student well ahead of time  what will be covered during the next lesson and what  the student should study or reference. The student  should always be briefed in a quiet area so there are  no distractions that can take their attention away from  the discussion.  

# Chapter Summary  

The components, sections, and systems that were covered  in this chapter were described so you as the instructor can  convey this information to your student. This is your guide to  further create a lesson plan and teach the student the “whys”  of the helicopter components, sections, and systems. What  was not covered in this chapter was the responsibility of the  instructor to also introduce the student to the helicopter’s  service reports, what they mean, and how to obtain them.  

Helicopter Components, Sections, and Systems  

# Objective  

The purpose of this lesson plan is to introduce the student to the basic components, sections, and systems of the  helicopter. The student will demonstrate a basic knowledge of the location of components, sections, and systems 

 (if installed). The student will have a basic understanding of how the systems operate (if installed).  

# Content  

1. Preflight discussion:  

a. Discuss lesson objective and completion standards. b. Normal checklist procedures coupled with introductory material identifying the location of components, sections,  and systems.  

2. Review basic helicopter components, sections, and systems.  

# 3. Instructor actions:  

a. Use preflight as introduction to the basic helicopter components, sections, and systems. b. Have the student identify the components, sections, and systems. Cover at a minimum (if installed): airframe,  fuselage, main rotor, tail rotor, swashplate assembly, freewheeling unit, engine, transmission, fuel system,  electrical system, hydraulics, and anti-icing system. (Note: avionics and navigation systems could be included  in this list of systems.) c. Introduce only a few components at a time. Too much information too soon overwhelms students. d. Perform a check on learning once the student has had the opportunity to see and identify the components,   sections, and systems. Have the student point out and explain each of the systems.

# Postflight Discussion  

1. Review what was covered during this phase of training.

 2. Preview and assign the next lesson. Assign  Helicopter Flying Handbook , Chapter 5, Rotorcraft Flight Manual.  

# Chapter 6 Rotorcraft Flight Manual  

# Introduction  

An essential component of flight instruction is ensuring the  student becomes familiar with publications that provide  information required for flight. One of those publications,  the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM), not only contains  information critical to safe flight, it is also required to be  carried in the aircraft. Introduce students to this manual  and the material it contains at the beginning of the training  program.  [Figure 6-1]  

![](images/e7d290b074309e4381ef0ba5b6617dea121b1f1b5aafa95540e7f0f1b34038e7.jpg)  

![](images/033b9af9aa2c37a813c6b5c19b362a1f051a1dff49d0c0a825c014daa80b69bc.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.   Rotorcraft Flight Manuals.  

# Introducing the Manual  

When introducing the manual for a particular helicopter, a  good place to begin is the certification basis of the helicopter  as defined by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 27, Airworthiness Standards: Normal  Category Rotorcraft, or Part 29, Airworthiness Standards:  Transport category rotorcraft. The certification establishes  the framework for development of the helicopter itself as well  as the performance requirements for that certification level.  

Another method for introducing the RFM to a student is to  review the manual section by section. Discuss the information  contained in each section and why that information is  important to a pilot. Explain that some manufacturers use  the title Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH). If POH is used,  the title page must include a statement to the effect that  the document is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  approved RFM.  

Emphasis must be placed on the fact that no two RFMs are  exactly alike. Explain to the student that although the manual  format is standardized for the make and model of an aircraft,  some of the information contained therein relates to a specific  aircraft. The title page indicates the registration number and  serial number of the aircraft to which the manual applies.  Ensure the student understands that an after-market POH  does not meet the requirements of the RFM.  

Another piece of information to include would be the subject  of supplements to the RFM. Students need to be advised of  the need for RFM supplements when equipment not included  in the type certificate data sheet (TCDS) is installed into  the aircraft. The supplement often changes procedures and  limitations stated in the RFM and would be more restrictive  than the more general factory information.  

The TCDS is a formal description of the aircraft, engine, or  propeller. It lists limitations and information required for  type certification, including airspeed limits, weight limits,  thrust limitations, etc. Assist the student in finding the TCDS  on the FAA website and show the student the basis for the  building of that helicopter and where the limitations are  stated.  [Figure 6-2]  

# Sections of the Manual  

# General Information (Section 1)  

The general information section provides basic descriptive  information on the helicopter and the powerplant and is a  good place for the instructor to familiarize the student with  the aircraft being flown. Since this section provides the basic  dimensions of the aircraft, examples of how the student might  use the information can be incorporated into the lesson plan.  Discussion of the aircraft’s overall dimensions can be used  to calculate hangar area required. The diameter of the rotor  disk can be used to determine the altitude of aircraft for  ground effect.  

The dimensions of the helicopter primarily define the amount  of space needed for the helicopter’s landing and takeoff  areas. For example, the hover pad should be the main rotor  diameter plus the tailrotor’s diameter and some margin  for maneuvering error and enough distance to be able to  clear obstructions during takeoff and landings. Review the  takeoff and landing charts with the student so they have a  better understanding of the distances involved. Review the  aerodynamics so the student remembers why vertical takeoffs  and landings, even if possible, are not advised, and probably  are not the safest maneuvers usable.  

The instructor should teach the student that for part 27  helicopters, the charts are advisory. Whereas, the charts for a  part 29 helicopter may be limiting depending on the verbiage  in the limitations section of the RFM. However, should an  accident occur, operating outside given acceptable parameters  may be grounds for a careless and reckless determination.  

# Operating Limitations (Section 2)  

This section contains those limitations necessary for the safe  operation of the aircraft and should be thoroughly reviewed  with the student. Divide this section into subsections for  discussion purposes: instrument markings, operating limits,  loading limits, and flight limitations; explain each one to  the student. Show the student how the information related  to instrument markings is depicted on the instruments in the  aircraft. Make the information relevant by explaining the  markings and how exceeding the limits affects flight.  

![](images/c01a763d6b63c01d45b7cbecea37b8868cc9c3dc682c4c280cd357efd00fb986.jpg)  
Figure 6-2.   Type certificate data sheet.  

Show the student the flight limitations section and discuss  how the limitations relate to safe flight. Review the weight  and loading distribution section, emphasizing the information  concerning maximum certificated weights, as well as the  center of gravity (CG) range. Point out any prohibited  maneuvers or restrictions to flight.  

Do not assume a student knows what a placard is—show an  actual placard on the aircraft. Always relate what is written  in the RFM to what and where it is on the actual aircraft.  First, identify the tachometer and explain the markings.  Then, point out which needle indicates engine revolutions  per minute (rpm) on which scale and where to read the rotor  rpm.  [Figure 6-3]  The student should be well aware of the  importance of maintaining rotor rpm at all costs. For example,  in dealing with emergency procedures not necessarily  documented in the RFM, if the rotor tachometer fails in  flight, maintaining powered flight and monitoring the engine  tachometer should keep the rotor within the limitations.  However, this should never be used to allow takeoff with  an inoperative main rotor tachometer. The student should  appreciate that if the rotor is in the low green range, then  the glide distance will be somewhat farther, but too little  

![](images/db3a133dc757909ae215558204246aeba179463e25cd4e70db0bb888af445f0c.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.   Identify and explain all placards to students when  instructing on limitations.  

rotor rpm allows the blades to fold or bend upward in flight  with no chance of recovery, or little to no cushioning energy  during the touchdown phase of an autorotation. Excessively  high main rotor rpm can overstress the blade retention parts  leading to immediate blade loss or begin stresses which lead  to blade loss in the future.  

# Emergency Procedures (Section 3)  

Remind the student that while flight is generally safe, it does  include an element of risk. One of the risks associated with  flight is equipment malfunction or failure. These include  engine, tail rotor, or system failure, or fire. Explain that the  manufacturer has developed procedures for coping with  emergencies and includes those procedures in this section.  [Figure 6-4]  

Accidents and helicopter operating history proves that  training in emergency procedures in helicopters is beneficial,  although sometimes expensive. Experience indicates that  helicopter training is much more demanding than airplane  training due to the differences in the machines and failure  modes. However, with the proper training, helicopter flight  can as safe as airplane flight.  

Although the FAA does not encourage memory items for  checklist procedures, due to the complexity and aerodynamics  of the helicopter, the helicopter pilot must be better trained,  more attentive, and more responsive than the average airplane  pilot. In many situations, the helicopter pilot must react  almost instantly and accomplish the necessary items without  the aid of a checklist since the emergency may end before a  checklist can be located, read, and followed.  

For example, helicopters commonly fly at an altitude of  approximately   $1{,}000^{\circ}$   above ground level (AGL). If an  engine or driveline component fails at this altitude, the time  remaining aloft is only about 44 seconds for common 4 or 5  place reciprocating-engine powered helicopters with a power- off descent rate of 1,350 feet per minute (fpm).  

Remind the student that, in those 44 seconds (or less with  the entry into autorotation), the pilot must:  

1. 	 Achieve autorotation airspeed, 2. 	 Control the rotor rpm, 3. 	 Confirm the wind direction on the surface, 4. 	 Find a suitable landing area, 5. 	 Maneuver into the suitable landing area while missing  any obstructions (e.g., wires, fences, trees, and  towers), 6. 	 Indentify the actual landing spot during a low, quick,  reconnaissance and then  

7. 	 Complete the autorotative landing while:  

a. 	 Thinking about a mayday call and b. 	 Accomplishing checklist cleanup items (e.g., fuel  valve closure, battery switch to off, and activation  of the ELT).  

All of these tasks must be accomplished while using both  hands to fly and keeping the aircraft in trim with the pedals.  Imagine the helicopter descending faster than the power-off  descent rate of   $1{,}350~\mathrm{fpm}$  , and that most helicopter pilots  train in aircraft much lighter than gross weight. In the rare  event something fails, that emergency landing may be the  pilot’s first at that weight.  

Using the RFM, show the student how the manufacturer  distinguishes the emergency procedures section and makes  it easy to find. Review the various types of emergencies  included in the RFM and the manufacturer’s recommended  procedures. Explain that manufacturers identify the  immediate actions that aid the pilot in maintaining aircraft  control when coping with an emergency. These actions must  be completed instinctively, without reference to a checklist.  If the situation permits, immediate action should always  be followed by completing the full emergency checklist to  ensure all items have been covered.  

More in-depth discussion of helicopter emergencies can  be found in the Helicopter Flying Handbook, Chapter 12,  Helicopter Emergencies. Emphasize to the student that  procedures in the RFM take precedence when there are  differences between the RFM and other publications regarding  pilot actions.  

# Normal Procedures (Section 4)  

A student should understand that the normal procedures  section of the RFM is used more than any other section since  it includes checklists for all phases of the flight from the  preflight inspection of the aircraft to the postflight inspection.  Explain to the student how proper use of a checklist ensures  manufacturer’s procedures are followed. Demonstrate the  proper use of the checklist for preflight, engine start through  shutdown, and postflight. Remember, an instructor serves  as an important role model for the student. Never complete  a checklist from memory. Reviewing accidents in which  checklist items were missed is a good technique to help the  student understand the importance of checklists in day-to-day  helicopter operations.  

More information concerning normal flight operations  and procedures can be found in Chapter 9, Basic Flight  Maneuvers, and Chapter 10, Advanced Flight Maneuvers,  as well as the Helicopter Flying Handbook.  

![](images/304bc8166a06c1c7438346ded22caf4d0e255320c99d79b8e6c1addc4186f317.jpg)  

# Performance (Section 5)  

The performance section contains all the information  required by the regulations and any additional performance  information the manufacturer determines may enhance  a pilot’s ability to operate the helicopter safely. When  discussing this section, emphasize the importance of the  correct use of charts in preflight planning to determine fuel  consumption or power or torque available for the given flight  conditions. Explain the differences between the in ground  effect (IGE) and out of ground effect (OGE) hover charts.  The most important function of discussing OGE versus  IGE hover charts is the possible performance restriction(s)  

if the helicopter cannot meet OGE requirements. In those  instances, instructors should show the student how to plan  approaches more carefully and maneuver the helicopter to  maintain ETL at all times. The instructor should ensure the  student understands the performance limitations, even if the  information is “advisory” and not regulatory limiting.  

Ensure the student understands how to read the height/ velocity diagram and the importance of the information  obtained from the chart, as well as how not to fly in the avoid  areas of the chart unless the flight task specifically demands  that profile. Again, make the use of the charts meaningful  by giving examples of how the information contained in  this section is used in determining the parameters of a flight.  For example, if the student plans the flight using the highest  temperature forecast and the highest altitude expected, then a  practical expectation of the helicopter’s performance can be  derived. If IGE hover is not possible by the charts, then the  loss of translational lift will probably result in a landing— desired or not! Always plan to hover IGE. If IGE hover  is not possible according to the charts, is the flight really  necessary at that weight? The student should remember that  a helicopter needs power to stop, come to a hover, and take  off to clear obstructions. Maybe less fuel can be carried, or  more than one trip can be flown to move the people or weight  in a safe manner. Direct the student to the Helicopter Flying  Handbook, Chapter 8, Helicopter Performance.  

# Weight and Balance (Section 6)  

The weight and balance section should contain all the  information required by the FAA to calculate weight and  balance. Explain to the student the importance of determining  the weight and balance of the aircraft for each flight. Weight  balance is very important to a helicopter with its limited CG  range. More important than the structural maximum gross  weight may be the maximum gross weight for the altitude  and temperature. Since the helicopter uses almost maximum  power for hovering, the loss of power due to thinner air at  higher altitudes and temperatures can be especially critical  to helicopter operations above cool sea level points.  

Show the student how the information provided in this  section is used to make weight and balance calculations.  Make the information relevant by demonstrating how to  complete a weight and balance computation for a training  flight. Refer the student to the Helicopter Flying Handbook,  Chapter 7, Weight and Balance, or the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge, Chapter 9, Weight and Balance,  for more information regarding weight and balance.  

# Aircraft and Systems Description (Section 7)  

The Helicopter Flying Handbook, Chapter 5, Helicopter  Components, Sections, and Systems, contains a general  description of the various systems found on a helicopter.  Explain to the student that this section of the RFM contains a  specific description of the systems on the aircraft. Emphasize  that a good pilot becomes familiar with the systems on the  aircraft because detailed knowledge of the systems of an  aircraft is essential for determining whether flight is advisable.  Explain to the student the best way to become familiar with  the systems is to study the information in this section.  

# Handling, Servicing, and Maintenance (Section 8)  

The handling, servicing, and maintenance section describes  the maintenance and inspections recommended by the  manufacturer, as well as those required by the regulations,  and airworthiness directive (AD) compliance procedures.  Explain that an AD is a notification to owners and operators  of certificated aircraft that a known safety deficiency with a  particular model of aircraft, engine, avionics, or other system  exists and must be corrected. If a certificated aircraft has  outstanding ADs with which the operator has not complied,  the aircraft is not considered airworthy. Thus, it is mandatory  for an aircraft operator to comply with an AD. ADs usually  result from service difficulty reported by operators or from  the results of aircraft accident investigations. They are issued  either by the national civil aviation authority of the country of  aircraft manufacture or of aircraft registration. When ADs are  issued by the country of registration, they are almost always  coordinated with the civil aviation authority of the country  of manufacture to ensure that conflicting ADs are not issued.  

In detail, the purpose an AD is to notify aircraft owners that:  

•	 The aircraft may have an unsafe condition, or •	 The aircraft may not be in conformity with its basis  of certification or of other conditions that affect the  aircraft’s airworthiness, or •	 There are mandatory actions that must be carried out  to ensure continued safe operation, or •	 In some urgent cases, the aircraft must not be flown  until a corrective action plan is designed and carried  out.  

ADs are mandatory in most jurisdictions and often contain  dates or number of additional aircraft flying hours by which  compliance must be completed. ADs may be divided into two  categories; those of an emergency nature requiring immediate  compliance prior to further flight, and those of a less urgent  nature requiring compliance within a specified period of time.  The student should know where the AD compliance record  is located in the maintenance logs of the helicopter and the  proper way to check it. Owner/operators of an aircraft must  now request to receive ADs electronically as the ADs are  no longer mailed to owners of record; however, the owner/ operators are still responsible for AD compliance.  

Acquaint the student with how this section outlines the  service, maintenance, and inspection intervals for the different  components of the aircraft. Point out that it also establishes  time-between-overhaul (TBO) limits for components, such  as rotor blades and gear boxes.  

Explain to the student that this section also describes the  preventive maintenance required, as well as ground handling  and storage procedures. The pilot should always know what  type and brand of oils are being used. The RFM may specify  what is acceptable, but it is best to not mix brands in engines  and transmissions/gearboxes.  

# Supplements (Section 9)  

When acquainting the student with the supplements section,  explain that this section provides pertinent information  necessary for the installation and operational considerations  of optional equipment, such as floats or spray equipment.  [Figure 6-5]  Stress that the information may be provided  by the aircraft manufacture or the optional equipment  manufacturer, and that in either case, it becomes part of  the RFM when the equipment is installed. Other important  information located in the supplement section includes  any changes required in the normal, abnormal, and  emergency checklists; and servicing, preflight or maintenance  requirements. Additions or supplements should always be  placed in the Supplement Section of the flight manual so that  the owner/operator maintains all additions and changes in

# Chapter 7 Weight and Balance  

# Introduction  

This chapter is intended to help the instructor to teach the  student the basics of helicopter weight and balance and  how to compute the weight and balance forms. Definitions  are abbreviated slightly, as the instructor’s experience is  recognized when working with the weight and balance form  and records. It is not intended to instruct the student on the  actual weighing of aircraft.  

The student must understand the reasons for weight and  balance control. Listed in  Figure 7-1  are some of the  important topics of discussion. Discuss the list with the  student. Refer the student to the Aircraft Weight and Balance  Handbook, FAA-H-8083-1, as well as the Rotorcraft Flight  Manual for that specific helicopter.  

![](images/af97d9e14e14e27c87cd418c97b5cc06cdfe2944e4b2d502ab9e12361df29817.jpg)  

#  

# Weight  

1. Operating above the weight limit stated by the manufacturer  compromises the structural integrity of the helicopter and  adversely affects maximum performance. It causes more  wear than anticipated in the rotor system, driveline, and  structures that can lead to premature failure of a part or  parts.

 2. If the helicopter is overweight, a unknown larger than  normal takeoff and landing area is required, rate and angle  of climb are reduced by an unknown value, maximum speed  is reduced by an unknown value, and fuel burn rate is  higher.

 3. Reduced maneuverability.

 4. Instability.

 5. Time before overhaul (TBO) is designed given a certain  predicted usage cycle and flight profile. If this flight profile is  not strictly followed, the TBO schedule is affected and costs  begin to skyrocket, with a crash being the greatest expense!  

# Balance  

6. Balance is critical because, on some fully loaded  helicopters, center of gravity (CG) deviations as small as  three inches can dramatically change a helicopter’s  handling characteristics. If the helicopter is out of allowable  CG range, you may run out of cyclic control (any quadrant). 

 7. Hazardous flight conditions and accidents resulting from  these conditions can be prevented by adherence to the  principles of weight and balance.  

Note: The responsibility for proper weight and balance control  begins with the helicopter engineers and designers and extends  to the aircraft mechanics who maintain the aircraft and the pilots  who operate them. Discuss with the student the importance of  staying below the maximum weight of the helicopter. Explain  that the Laws of Physics are unbreakable; attempts to break  these laws through poor decisions such as overloading or simply  an error in calculations will instead result in the breakage of the  helicopter. Weight is important because it is the basis for  determining the maneuvering load with the G loading factored  onto the rotor system and transmission. Explain to the student  that the manufacturer, through the engineering and testing  process, has developed limitations to be applied for the safe  operation of the helicopter. Adherence to these limitations will  avoid placing excessive stress and fatigue on weak points  throughout the helicopter. The student should not assume what  the weak point or limiting factor is to exceed selected limitations.  Due to the distance and complexity of the drive train, the  antitorque system in many helicopters may be the actual  unstated weak point. Too much antitorque thrust over a period  of time has led to failures of the tail rotor blades, gearboxes,  pylon, and tail boom attachment points.  

Figure 7-1.   Weight and balance topics for an instructor to use in  discussions with students.  

# Weight  

The weight of a helicopter is critical during any and all flight  maneuvers. This chapter primarily considers the weight of  the loaded helicopter while at rest.  

# Definitions  

Discuss all the weight and balance terms with the student  which can be found in the Aircraft Weight and Balance  Handbook, FAA-H-8083-1. The student should have an  understanding of the terms in order to consistently and  successfully monitor weight and balance and complete weight  and balance forms.  

Never intentionally exceed the load limits for which a  helicopter is certificated. Operating above the maximum  weight could result in structural deformation or failure  during flight if excessive load factors, strong wind gusts, or  turbulence were encountered, as well as operating below a  minimum crew weight could adversely affect the handling  characteristics of the helicopter. Operations at or below  the minimum weight of the helicopter can also affect the  autorational characteristics of the helicopter.  

Other factors to consider when computing weight and balance  are high altitude, high temperature, and high humidity  conditions, which result in a high density altitude. As density  altitude increases, more power is required. Any adjustment  to gross weight by varying fuel, payload, or both, affects the  power required. For this reason, the maximum operational  weight may be less than the maximum allowable weight.  In-depth performance planning is critical when operating in  these conditions.  

Most small helicopters have some type of seating limitations.  Two examples are the Robinson R-22 and Robinson R-44.  The R-22 has a 240-pound seat limit (includes any cargo  below the seat). The R-44 has a 300-pound limit with a  50-pound cargo limit included within the 300 pounds.  Therefore, if 50 pounds of cargo were placed under a seat,  the passenger or pilot could weigh no more than 250 pounds.  Also, the external load limit includes the weight of the load  and the lifting slings and hardware.  

# Determining Empty Weight  

A helicopter’s weight and balance records contain essential  data, including a complete list of all installed optional  equipment. Use these records to determine the weight and  balance condition of the empty helicopter. Lead the student  through a weight and balance problem, as well as preflight  planning exercise before most flights. Once the student is  proficient at weight and balance, then he or she should be  allowed to reuse the previous planning information (provided  that the conditions did not change).  

When a helicopter is delivered from the factory, the basic  empty weight, empty weight CG, and useful load are  recorded on a weight and balance data sheet included in the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Rotorcraft  Flight Manual (RFM). If equipment is removed, replaced,  or additional equipment installed, these changes must be  reflected in the weight and balance records. Major repairs  or alterations must be recorded by a certificated mechanic.  When the revised weight and moment are recorded on a new  form, the old record is marked with the word “superseded”  and dated with the effective date of the new record.  

# Balance  

Some helicopters may be properly loaded for takeoff, but  near the end of a long flight with almost empty fuel tanks,  the CG may have shifted enough for the helicopter to be out  of balance laterally or longitudinally. Before making any  long flight, the CG with the fuel available for landing must  be checked to ensure it is within the allowable range. It is  essential to load the aircraft within the allowable CG range  specified in the RFM’s weight and balance limitations.  

# Center of Gravity (CG)  

The CG is defined as the theoretical point where all of the  aircraft’s weight is considered to be concentrated. Improper  balance of a helicopter’s load can result in serious control  problems.  

The allowable range in which the CG may fall is called the  CG range. The exact CG location and range are specified  in the RFM for each helicopter. In addition to making a  helicopter difficult to control, an out-of-balance loading  condition also decreases maneuverability since cyclic control  is less effective in the direction opposite to the CG location.  

Changing the CG changes the angle at which the aircraft  hangs from the rotor. When the CG is directly under the  rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontally; if the CG is  too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs with its  nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast, the nose  tilts up.  [Figure 7-2]  Discuss with the student some of the  reactions of the helicopter and problems associated with a  forward CG and an aft CG.  

# CG Forward of Forward Limit  

Forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger  take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the  rotor mast. This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are  located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the CG  continues to shift forward.  

Teach the student to assess the helicopter control response  prior to each flight. Have the student get the helicopter light  on the skids/gear and ensure helicopter is free of surface  obstructions or attachments and will ascend to a hover in  a nearly level attitude. Ensure that there is enough cyclic  control to continue. Once at a low hover, ensure the helicopter  remains nearly level. Point out to the student what a normal  hover attitude looks like, and that if things do not feel or  look right, then to lower the collective slowly and land  the helicopter. Attempt to determine why the helicopter is  responding in such a way. Adjustment or reduction of load  may be necessary.  

Do not continue flight in this condition. Decelerating  the helicopter in this condition may be very difficult or  impossible as well. In the event of engine failure and the  resulting autorotation, there may not be enough cyclic control  to flare properly for the landing.  

# CG Aft of Aft Limit  

Exceeding aft CG may occur when:  

•	 A lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of  fuel located aft of the rotor mast.  •	 A lightweight pilot takes off with maximum baggage  allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the  rotor mast.  •	 A lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of  baggage and substantial fuel, both of which are aft of  the rotor mast.  

![](images/df6be66ea9c34af391dc65b55ef110179536139aa81ebc3bd681ef11da8bd7cb.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.   The location of the CG strongly influences how the helicopter handles.  

Easily recognized when coming to a hover, the helicopter has  a tail-low attitude, and needs excessive forward displacement  of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition.  If there is a wind, even greater forward cyclic is needed.  

NOTE: One technique used in smaller helicopters is to show  the student what a tail-low (nose high) attitude looks like.  To do this, seat the student (pilot seat) in a parked helicopter  (engine off). Pull the tail boom down or lift the front skids  until the tail stinger or guard touches ground. Tell the student  to commit this helicopter position to memory and never allow  the helicopter to achieve this attitude while in flight.  

Gusty or rough air could accelerate the helicopter to a speed  faster than that produced with full forward cyclic control. In  this case, dissymmetry of lift and blade flapping could cause  the rotor disk to tilt aft. With full forward cyclic control  already applied, a pilot might not be able to lower the rotor  disk, resulting in possible loss of control or rotor blades  striking the tail boom.  

# Lateral Balance  

Discuss with the student the problems associated with lateral  balances.  

With small helicopters, it is generally unnecessary to  determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and  passenger flights. The cabins are relatively narrow and most  optional equipment is located near the centerline. If there is  an unusual situation that could affect the lateral CG, such  as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel on one side of the  helicopter, its position should be checked against the CG  envelope. Certain types of helicopters require a pilot to verify  the lateral balance often, such as external hoist operations  (hoist located on the side of the helicopter).  

Helicopter engineers determine the amount of cyclic control  that is available. They establish both the longitudinal and  lateral CG envelopes. This allows the pilot to load the  helicopter and still have sufficient cyclic control for all flight  conditions. Operating the helicopter outside these limits is  inadvisable and control of the helicopter may not be possible  in some conditions.  

# Ballast  

Ballast is some form of weight placed in a specific location  in an aircraft intended to maintain the CG within limits by  compensating for unfavorable weight and balance conditions,  thereby ensuring correct control margins. Two types are  permanent ballast and temporary ballast.  

1.	 Permanent ballast—the removal or addition of  equipment to the helicopter has an effect on aircraft  weight and balance. It may be necessary to install  

ballast weights to maintain the CG position within  the CG limits.  

2.	 Temporary ballast—such weights that may be  necessary to compensate for missing crewmembers  or equipment in order to maintain CG position. The  amount and location of temporary ballast required to  maintain safe flight is determined by the pilot or the  airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanics. Ensure  that any ballast is properly secured or strapped down to  prevent movement. When ballast moves, it compounds  the CG problem instead of relieving it.  

# Weight and Balance Calculations  

To determine whether a helicopter is properly loaded, ask  the following questions:  

1.	 Is the gross weight less than or equal to the maximum  

allowable gross weight? 	 Answer: Add the weights of the items comprising the  useful load to the basic empty weight of the helicopter  (pilot, passengers, fuel, oil (if applicable), cargo, and  baggage).  2. 	 Is the CG within the allowable CG range, and will  it stay within the allowable range throughout the  duration of flight including all loading configurations  that may be encountered? 	 Answer: Use CG or moment information from loading  charts, tables, or graphs in the RFM. Then using one  of the methods described below, calculate the loaded  moment and/or loaded CG and verify that it falls  within the allowable CG range shown in the RFM.  	 NOTE: Discuss with the student which direction the  CG shifts as fuel is burned. On some helicopters,  the fuel tanks are behind the CG, causing it to shift  forward as fuel is used. Under some flight conditions,  the balance may shift enough that there is not sufficient  cyclic authority to flare for landing. For these  helicopters, the loaded CG should be computed for  both takeoff and landing weights.  

Use CG or moment information from loading charts,  tables, or graphs in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual  (RFM). Calculate the loaded moment and/or loaded CG and verify that it falls within the allowable CG  range shown in the RFM.  

It is important to note that any weight and balance computation  is only as accurate as the information provided. Therefore,  determine passenger weight and add a few pounds to account  for the additional weight of clothing, especially during the  winter months. The baggage weight should be weighed on a  scale, if practical. If a scale is not available, compute personal  loading values according to each individual estimate.  

# Weight Versus Aircraft Performance  

Overloading an aircraft may cause structural failure or result  in reduced engine and airframe life. An increase in gross  weight has the following effects on aircraft performance:  

a. 	 Increases takeoff distance b. 	 Reduces hover performance c. 	 Reduces rate of climb d. 	 Reduces cruising speed e. 	 Reduces maneuverability f. 	 Reduces ceiling g. 	 Reduces range h. 	 Increases landing distances  

NOTE: Ensure that the student understands the importance  of not overloading the helicopter (operating at maximum  weights) and also understands how the helicopters weight  versus performance is also affected. Accurate performance  planning based on current and forecast environmental  conditions is critical in determining the helicopter’s actual  maximum operational weight for any given set of conditions  

Figure 7-3  indicates the standard weights for specific  operating fluids.  

![](images/198d7c0361134b89ba65265e985129746bc0bc1cbc311b92e161088080c8df2c.jpg)  

Figure 7-3.   When making weight and balance computations, always  use actual weights if they are available, especially if the helicopter  is loaded near the weight and balance limits.  

# Reference Datum  

Figure 7-4  indicates some of the different locations of the  horizontal reference datum. Balance is determined by the  location of the CG, which is usually described as a given  number of inches from the reference datum. The horizontal  reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane or point  arbitrarily fixed somewhere along the longitudinal axis of the  helicopter from which all horizontal distances are measured  for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its  location; it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the  

![](images/c35e2cebc633bd1d4a41410861a8dde52f1cb23c2a6830d42d3b698377258dc6.jpg)  
Figure 7-4.   While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere  the manufacturer chooses, some manufacturers choose the datum  line at or ahead of the most forward structural point on the  helicopter, in which case all moments are positive. This aids in  simplifying calculations. Other manufacturers choose the datum  line at some point in the middle of the helicopter, in which case  moments produced by weight in front of the datum are negative and  moments produced by weight aft of the datum are positive.  

helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter.  The lateral reference datum is usually located at the center  of the helicopter. The location of the reference datum is  established by the manufacturer and is defined in the RFM.  [Figure 7-5]  

The lateral CG is determined in the same way as the  longitudinal CG, except the distances between the scales  and butt line zero (BL 0) are used as the arms. Arms to the  right of BL 0 are positive and those to the left are negative.  The BL 0 (sometimes referred to as the buttock) is a line  through the symmetrical center of an aircraft from nose to  tail. It serves as the datum for measuring the arms used to  find the lateral CG. Lateral moments that cause the aircraft  to rotate clockwise are positive   $(+)$  , and those that cause it  to rotate counterclockwise are negative   $(-)$  .  

# Arm (Station)  

The horizontal distance from the datum to any component  of the helicopter or to any object located on the helicopter is  called the “arm” or “station.”  

# Moment  

If the weight of an object is multiplied by its arm, the result  is known as its moment. Think of a moment as a force that  results from an object’s weight acting at a distance. Moment  

![](images/c0dfe5887c11043dfca450ea038fcf250c8e172b5a74a8c3dc26ae9f603f7035.jpg)  
Figure 7-5.   The lateral reference datum is located longitudinally  through the center of the helicopter; therefore, there are positive  and negative values.  

is also referred to as the tendency of an object to rotate or  pivot about a point. The farther an object is from a pivotal  point, the greater its force.  

# Weight and Balance Methods  

Discuss with the student the two different methods  of obtaining the weight and balance of the helicopter:  computational and loading chart.  

# Computational Method  

The first method is the computational method, which uses  simple mathematics to solve weight and balance problems.  

1.	 Ascertain the total weight and total moment of the  helicopter and ensure it does not exceed the maximum  allowable weight under existing or forecast conditions.  In this case, the total weight of the helicopter is under  the maximum gross weight of 3,200 pounds.  	 Tip:  The empty weight CG can be considered the arm  of the empty helicopter. Use care in recording the  weight of each passenger and baggage. Recording  each weight in its proper location is extremely  important for the accurate calculation of a CG.  

2.	 Now, divide the total moment by the total weight. This  gives the CG of the loaded helicopter.  

The bottom of the chart in  Figure 7-6  lists the CG range for  this particular helicopter. Take the CG figure and compare it  to the allowable limits of 106.0 inches to 114.2 inches. The  CG’s location of 109.9 inches is within the acceptable range. NOTE: If the CG falls outside the acceptable limits, adjust  the loading of the helicopter.  

![](images/4b043a0857123380b75073669ae720b62ee81d99b1f383c53b3190c3f33de1ae.jpg)  

Figure 7-6.   In this example, the helicopter’s weight of 1,700 pounds  is recorded in the first column, its CG or arm of 116.5 inches in  the second, and its moment of 198,050 lb-in in the last. Notice that  the weight of the helicopter multiplied by its CG equals its moment.  

If adjustments need to be made to the loading, refer the  student to the Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook,  FAA-H-8083-1.  

# Loading Chart Method  

The second method is the loading chart method. Three sample  problems are given for this method. Take time to ensure the  student fully understands the weight and balance concept  and computations.  

Figure 7-7  is an example of a loading chart. To use this  chart, a pilot must:  

1.	 Subtotal the empty weight, pilot, and passengers. This  is the weight at which to enter the chart on the left.  2.	 The next step is to follow the upsloping lines for  baggage and then for fuel to arrive at a final weight  and CG.  

NOTE: Any value on or inside the envelope is within the  range.  

# Sample Problem 1  

The student may not understand how or why the numbers  are entered on the chart. (Explain the numbers to the student.  Most manufacturers provide samples with their charts;  

figuring the charts out is a matter of inputting your own  numbers.) The loading chart used in sample problems 1 and 2  is designed to calculate the loaded CG graphically and show  whether it is within limits, all on a single chart.  

Determine if the gross weight and CG are within allowable  limits under the following loading conditions for a helicopter  based on the loading chart in  Figure 7-7.  To use the loading  chart for the helicopter in this example, add up the items in  a certain order. The maximum allowable gross weight is  1,600 pounds.  

![](images/433f95676341833bed73c4e1292bbef3f7b45f7c0f6444a294b1765362c3cc1d.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.   Loading chart illustrating the solution to sample  problems 1 and 2.  

NOTE: In  Figure 7-7,  the helicopter weights are located on  the left side of the chart and the CG limits are located on the  top of the chart.  

ITEM	 	 	 WEIGHT (LB) Basic empty weight		 1,040 Pilot	 	 	    135 Passenger	 	 	    200 Subtotal	 	 	 1,375 (point A)  

1. 	 Follow the green arrows in  Figure 7-7.  Enter the graph  on the left side at 1,375 lb., the subtotal of the empty  weight plus the pilot and passenger weights. Move  right to Point A.  

Baggage compartment load	      25 lb Subtotal	 	 	 1,400 lb (Point B)  

2. 	 Move up and to the right, parallel to the baggage  compartment loading lines to 1,400 lb (Point B).  

Fuel load (30 gallons)	    180 lb Total weight	 	 1,580 lb (Point C)  

3. 	 Continue up and to the right, this time parallel to  the fuel loading lines, to the total weight of 1,580 lb  (Point C).  

Point C is within allowable weight and CG limits.  

# Sample Problem 2  

Assume that the pilot in sample problem 1 discharges the  passenger after using only 20 lb of fuel.  

ITEM	 	 	 WEIGHT (LB) Basic empty weight		 1,040 Pilot	 	 	    135 Subtotal	 	 	 1,175 (Point D)  

1.	 Follow the purple arrows in  Figure 7-7,  starting at  1,175 lb on the left side of the graph, then to Point D.  

Baggage compartment load	      25 lb Subtotal	 	 	 1,200 lb (Point E)  

Note the total weight of the helicopter is well below the  maximum allowable gross weight; however, point F falls  outside the aft allowable CG limit. As standard practice,  compute the weight and balance with zero fuel to verify that  a helicopter remains within the acceptable limits as fuel is  used. It is imperative that weight and CG be within allowable  limits for all phases of the flight or successive flights.  Weight  and CG change as loading configurations change; therefore,  more than one weight and balance calculation needs to be  accomplished.  Initial calculations are based upon a fully  loaded aircraft for the first takeoff; subsequent calculations  address loading configuration changes, such as passenger drop  off, fuel consumption and refueling. Addressing calculations  for all projected loading configurations ensures that weight  and CG remain within limits during all phases of the flight.  

Discuss with the student some options he or she could use  in order to fix the out-of-CG condition.  

Sample Problem 3 Calculate moments for each station.  

![](images/53b8dc684535f512bce1e4b160c7c1c8a0ab6e61cd63ea4762178c5669b90b8e.jpg)  

\* Use chart in  Figure 7-8.  

1. 	 Record the basic empty weight and moment. 2. 	 Record the weights of the pilot, passengers, fuel, and  baggage on a weight and balance worksheet. 3. 	 Determine the total weight of the helicopter. 4. 	 Determine if the helicopter weight is within limits.  (load limit on bottom of chart in  Figure 7-9 ) 5. 	 Determine the moments for a pilot and passenger (340  lb) and fuel (211 lb).  [Figure 7-8]  

![](images/cd39eccb237e2c435abb64a5e34109c17247d0557c2bdcc7ca2cb8c85cd992b8.jpg)  
Figure 7-8.   Moments for fuel, pilot, and passenger.  

6. 	 Using  Figure 7-8,  start at the bottom scale labeled  load weight. Draw a line from 211 lb up to the line  labeled “Fuel—station 108.5.” Draw a line to the left  

![](images/8045cfce2d0e40d260c814379b58cb3f0005bc9b582574890de2545836adcaf9.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.   CG/Moment chart.  

to intersect the moment scale and read the fuel moment  (22.9 thousand lb-in).  

7. 	 Do the same for the pilot/passenger moment. Draw  a line from a weight of 340 lb up to the line labeled  “Pilot & passenger—station 83.2.” Go left and read  the pilot/passenger moment (28.3 thousand lb-in). 8. 	 After recording the basic empty weight and moment  of the helicopter and the weight and moment for each  item, total and record all weights and moments. 9. 	 Plot the calculated takeoff weight and moment on the  sample moment envelope graph. Based on a weight  of 1,653 lb and a moment/1,000 of 162 lb-in, the  helicopter is within the prescribed CG limits.  

NOTE: Reduction factors are often used to reduce the size  of large numbers to manageable levels. In  Figure 7-8,  the  scale on the loading graph gives moments in thousands of  pound-inches. In most cases, when using this type of chart, a  pilot need not be concerned with reduction factors because the  CG/moment envelope chart normally uses the same reduction  factor.  [Figure 7-9]  

# Combination Method  

The combination method usually uses the computation  method to determine the moments and CG. Then, these  figures are plotted on a graph to determine if they intersect  within the acceptable envelope.  

The example in  Figure 7-10  illustrates that with a total weight  of 2,399 pounds and a total moment of 225,022 lb-in, the CG  is 93.8. Plotting this CG against the weight indicates that the  helicopter is loaded within the longitudinal limits (Point A).  

# Calculating Lateral CG  

Some helicopter manufacturers require that pilots also  determine the lateral CG limits. Lateral balance of an airplane  is usually of little concern and is not normally calculated.  But some helicopters, especially those equipped for hoist  operations, are sensitive to the lateral position of the CG,  and the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) includes both  longitudinal and lateral CG envelopes, as well as information  on the maximum permissible host load.  

These calculations are similar to longitudinal calculations.  However, since the lateral CG datum line is almost always  defined as the center of the helicopter, a pilot is likely to  encounter negative CGs and moments in the calculations.  Negative values are located on the left side while positive  stations are located on the right.  

When completing the steps below to calculate lateral CG,  refer to  Figure 7-11.  

1. 	 When computing moment for the pilot, 170 lb is  multiplied by the arm of 12.2 inches, resulting in a  moment of 2,074 lb-in. As with any weight placed  right of the aircraft centerline, the moment is expressed  as a positive value.

# Figure 7-11.   Computed lateral CG.  

2. 	 The forward passenger sits left of the aircraft  centerline. To compute this moment, multiply 250  lb by  $-10.4$   inches. The result is a moment of  $_{-2,600}$  lb-in.  

3. 	 Once the aircraft is completely loaded, the weights and  moments are totaled and the CG is computed. Since  more weight is located left of the aircraft centerline,  

![](images/b6624d24948b484f4bc779b985366980900c544ca7c919837d43e69a33bbc9c3.jpg)  

the resulting total moment is –3,837 lb-in. To calculate  CG, divide  $^{-3,837}$   lb-in by the total weight of 2,399  lb. The result is –1.6 inches, or a CG that is 1.6 inches  left of the aircraft centerline.  

Lateral CG is often plotted against the longitudinal CG.  [Figure 7-12]  In this case,  $-1.6$   is plotted against 93.8, which  was the longitudinal CG determined in the previous problem.  The intersection of the two lines falls well within the lateral  CG envelope.

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Review all the terms associated with weight and  balance with the student. •	 Review the sample weight and balance problems with  the student. •	 Ensure that the student understands weight and balance  must remain within limits after all loading, unloading,  refueling, and fuel consumption. •	 Ensure that the student understands current and forecast  environmental conditions affect the performance of  the aircraft, thereby affecting weight and loading  limitations. •	 Review and practice with the student the actual weight  and balance forms for the helicopter to be flown. •	 Ensure the student understands the charts by using  weights and/or balances that may put the helicopter  in an out-of-weight or out-of-balance condition. •	 The more the student works the weight and balance  figures, the more proficient the student will become  at computing weight and balance.  [Figure 7-13]

# Chapter 8 Helicopter  Performance  

# Introduction  

It is imperative for the student to realize safety correlates  directly to a comprehensive understanding of performance  planning. Performance planning incorporates engine power  available and rotor system efficiency to establish helicopter  performance values. The student must be able to recognize  the impact of density altitude, helicopter weight, and other  environmental factors in order to maximize each helicopter’s  unique capabilities, while understanding its limitations.  Failure to conduct performance planning properly may lead  to disastrous consequences.  

# Factors Affecting Performance  

Instructors should ensure the student has a firm grasp on the  four major factors affecting helicopter performance: density  altitude, weight, loads, and wind. Emphasis must be placed on  the importance of proper and thorough performance planning  prior to each flight.  

# Density Altitude  

The instructor should convey to the student the need for a  comprehensive knowledge of density altitude. The student  must understand what combinations of high elevations, low  atmospheric pressure, high temperatures, and high humidity  directly impact density altitude and its affect on helicopter  performance.  

Explain that density altitude is pressure altitude corrected  for nonstandard temperature. High density altitude refers  to thin air while low density altitude refers to dense air.  [Figure 8-1]  Air density is affected by changes in altitude,  temperature, and humidity. Conditions that result in a  high density altitude are high elevations, low atmospheric  pressures, high temperatures, high humidity, or some  combination of these factors. Lower elevations, high  atmospheric pressure, low temperatures, and low humidity  are more indicative of low density altitude.  

Using the building block concept, explain the factors that  may increase or decrease density altitude. The predominant  factors are atmospheric pressure, altitude, temperature,  and moisture. Use examples of each factor’s impact on  the performance planning used for the aircraft to be flown.  Stressing the impact that each factor has on density altitude  leads to a greater awareness of the student to these ambient  conditions. The lift equation is an effective tool that can be  used to show the affect of an increase or decrease of density  altitude on aircraft performance.  

# Lift  $=$   coefficient of lift  x  density  x  velocity 2   x  lifting surface area                                                   2  

Once the student has a clear understanding of how density  altitude affects helicopter performance, you can advance  to actual flight demonstrations and hands-on practice. The  instructor can set artificial limitations on the amount of  available torque or temperature to simulate operations in  environments that cause actual reductions in power margins.  While this provides a demonstration to the student, it is not  a substitute for actual conditions.  

The instructor could ask the student to determine performance  for a maneuver, such as OGE hover, for a low or field  elevation, and then for one at a much higher altitude normally  found in the area of flight. Then, the instructor could discuss  

![](images/8a3882f8091c11507f0d5913283dd75d3b3109ca893d2d0a507ff79d2ab2fbef.jpg)  
Figure 8-1.   Three atmospheres are illustrated. The Standard Atmosphere   $(29.92\ ^{\prime\prime}H g$   and   $l5~^{\circ}C_{\bullet}$  ) is shown in the middle in gray. A less  dense atmosphere (A) (lower pressure and/or higher temperature) is shown on the right in red. A denser atmosphere  $(B)$   (higher pressure  and/or colder temperature) is illustrated on the left in blue.  

the difference with the student and ask the student to describe  the practical response differences of the helicopter in the two  situations. The instructor may be able to simulate higher  elevation power of the helicopter performance by artificially  limiting the power the student can use (e.g., limit the manifold  pressure or torque to be used). However, the instructor cannot  limit the lift and efficiency of the rotor system. The instructor  must ensure the student understands the lack of fidelity of the  simulation and the hazards awaiting the pilot at high density  altitudes, such as lower   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  , less antitorque available, less  lift from the rotor system, slower engine response, and higher  collective pitch settings for cruise and hovering.  

If the student makes errors during the simulated high-altitude  practice, the increased power is still there, whereas the power  is simply not there at actual higher altitudes. At higher  altitudes, helicopters do not have the margins of performance  necessary to correct errors in planning or judgment. Due to the  retreating blade stall characteristic of helicopters, increasing  altitudes yield no performance improvements over 5,000 feet  to 6,000 feet depending on the design and powerplant(s).  Therefore, when operating in higher terrain, any altitude  gains above takeoff elevation usually results in decreasing  performance. By the very nature of a helicopter, a pilot must be  versed in the performance limitations imposed by the change  in the environment. The pilot must understand the limitations  of increased altitudes and plan accordingly. Therefore, the  instructor must include that planning in the syllabus.  

Refer to Chapter 10 of the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25) for a detailed explanation  of density altitude as it relates to aircraft performance and  Chapter 3 for more information on the structure of our  atmosphere.  

# Weight  

The student should possess a basic understanding of the  aerodynamics of weight opposing lift. As the weight of the  helicopter increases, the power required to produce lift also  must increase. The instructor should use the helicopter’s  performance charts in the relevant Pilot’s Operating  Handbook (POH) to demonstrate minimum and maximum  weight configurations and how that correlates to required  power with a given set of environmental conditions. A  beneficial technique is to show various power/torque  requirements at graduated weight and altitude increments,  culminating with high gross weight/high altitude condition.  This demonstrates the additional power required as weight  and/or density altitude increase. Validation of this exercise  can be accomplished using similar data in performance charts  while flying at various weights and altitudes and noting the  corresponding torque values, or using fuel weight at various  stages of the flight. As fuel (i.e., weight) is burned off, power  requirements decrease. This gives the student a practical  application of his planning.  

# Loads  

The strength of the helicopter is measured  by the total load  the rotor blades are capable of carrying without causing  permanent damage. The load imposed upon the rotor blades  depends largely on the type of flight. The blades must  support not only the weight of the helicopter and its contents  (gross weight), but also the additional loads imposed during  maneuvers.  

In straight-and-level flight, the rotor blades support a  weight equal to the helicopter and its contents. So long as  the helicopter is moving at a constant altitude and airspeed  in a straight line, the load on the blades remains constant.  When the helicopter assumes a curved flightpath—all types  of turns (except hovering turns utilizing pedals only), flares,  and pullouts from dives—the actual load on the blades is  much greater because of the centrifugal force produced by the  curved flight. This additional load results in the development  of much greater stresses on the rotor blades.  

# Load Factor  

The load factor is the actual load on the rotor blades at any  time, divided by the normal load or gross weight (weight of  the helicopter and its contents). Any time a helicopter flies in  a curved flightpath, the load supported by the rotor blades is  greater than the total weight of the helicopter. The tighter the  curved flightpath, that is, the steeper the bank, or the more  rapid the flare or pullout from a dive, the greater the load  supported by the rotor; therefore, the greater the load factor.  The load factor and, hence, apparent gross weight increase is  relatively small in banks up to  $30^{\circ}$  . Even so, under the right  set of adverse circumstances, such as high-density altitude,  gusty air, high gross weight, and poor pilot technique,  sufficient power may not be available to maintain altitude  and airspeed. Above   $30^{\circ}$   of bank, the apparent increase in  gross weight soars. At  $30^{\circ}$   of bank, the apparent increase is  only 16 percent, but at   $60^{\circ}$  , it is 100 percent.  

If the weight of the helicopter is 1,600 pounds, the weight  supported by the rotor in a   $30^{\circ}$   bank at a constant altitude  would be 1,856 pounds (  $(1,\!600+256)$  ). In a  $60^{\circ}$   bank, it would  be 3,200 pounds; and in an   $80^{\circ}$   bank, it would be almost six  times as much or 8,000 pounds.  

One additional cause of large load factors is rough or  turbulent air. The severe vertical gusts produced by  turbulence can cause a sudden increase in angle of attack,  resulting in increased rotor blade loads that are resisted by  the inertia of the helicopter.  

To be certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA), each helicopter must have a maximum permissible  limit load factor that should not be exceeded. As a pilot, you  should have the basic information necessary to fly a helicopter  safely within its structural limitations. Be familiar with the  situations in which the load factor may approach maximum  and avoid them. If you meet such situations inadvertently,  you must know the proper technique.  

# Wind  

Much like density altitude, awareness of the wind’s influence  plays a large part in performance planning. To avoid the  potential for wind-induced incidents, the student must  understand the impact of wind on the handling of the aircraft,  as well as performance planning.  

One simple demonstration can be conducted while completing  hover checks. Caution must be taken not to jeopardize  controllability while performing this demonstration. In some  cases, the instructor may need to fly so the student can focus  more on the engine instruments. Position the aircraft into the  wind, note the power required, then conduct pedal turns at   $90^{\circ}$   increments. At each subsequent heading change, note  the variation in power required and difficulty in maintaining  heading control. Depending on the wind velocity, moderate to  sizable increases in power will be noticed. This will facilitate  understanding of the impact that directional wind has on  power requirements and the importance of wind direction  awareness. Additionally, this demonstrates to the student  the changes in power required by the tail rotor to overcome  the tendency of the aircraft to weather vane into the wind. A  comparison of hover power into the wind versus with a tail  wind is very effect in demonstrating this flight characteristic.  In gusty wind conditions, it is also important to note the  momentary spikes in torque while attempting to maintain a  stationary hover.  

Discussing the impact of wind on translational lift best  illustrates contrasting effects of a takeoff or landing into  a headwind or with a tailwind. If, in a no-wind situation,  translational lift occurs when airspeed reaches approximately  16 to 24 knots, then the impact of directional wind will  increase or decrease that range. Noting this, the student can  see the advantage of using the headwind to more quickly  depart the vortices caused by in ground effect conditions.  Conversely, the student will understand that a prolonged  in-ground-effect condition (and the need for greater power)  exists during a takeoff with a tailwind conditions, because  the aircraft must accelerate more to outrun the wind and pass  through translational lift.  

Also discuss with the student that during a landing, if there  is a headwind present, it may help prevent a settling with  power situation from developing. Conversely, if there is  a tailwind, settling with power conditions are encountered  earlier as the helicopter slows for a landing. A crosswind is  much more preferable to a tailwind. The instructor should  work with the student to ensure an understanding of the  apparent groundspeed versus airspeed factors and differences.  If a pilot begins a landing approach with a 10 knot tailwind,  at some time in the approach, the helicopter experiences a  zero knot airspeed, which means a total loss of translational  lift and thrust. In order to maintain the approach angle, more  power must be added. If the conditions of less than 10 knots  of airspeed, more than 300 feet per minute rate of descent  and more than 20 percent power is applied to the rotor system  exist, the helicopter is prone to encounter settling with power.  

# Height/Velocity Diagram  

Ensure the student understands the information in the height/ velocity diagram in the applicable POH/RFM and knows  how to fly to avoid those unsafe areas in the height/velocity  diagram.  [Figure 8-2]  Referring to the aerodynamics of  autorotation, explain that this chart shows those heights above  ground and airspeeds which, in the event of engine or drive  train failure, an experienced pilot should be able to make a  safe autorotational landing. The instructor must stress that  the conditions provided in the chart are ideal conditions with  an experienced pilot.  

![](images/8a030e8c7c996378627852f0320e553cb84ed040a4db02e5b3b16bc2bd80aa34.jpg)  
Figure 8-2.   Height/velocity diagram.  

The instructor may wish to revisit the aerodynamic theory  of autorotation. Specifically, discuss that altitude equates  to potential energy; therefore, during autorotational descent  the unpowered rotor system maintains kinetic energy as the  descending helicopter loses potential energy in the form  of altitude. Through the use of turns, flares, and collective  control, the pilot can regulate the amount of available kinetic  energy within the rotor system. This rotational kinetic energy  in the rotor system is used during the deceleration and landing  to slow and cushion the landing.  

If power is lost in situations of higher altitudes  [Figure 8-2, area  $A J$   and low to no airspeed, such as OGE  operations, the helicopter may not be able to maintain  enough kinetic energy (rotation of the rotor system) to  establish the minimum rate of descent airspeed necessary  for a successful landing. Also, in flight profiles with higher  airspeed  [Figure 8-2, area  $B J$   and extremely low altitudes,  engine failure can cause loss of altitude that will not allow  time to take appropriate action to establish an autorotational  profile. An effective demonstration of this phenomenon is  to have the student note the amount of altitude lost during  a high-altitude entry into an autorotational profile and then  relate this loss to what would happen in the same situation  at low altitudes.  

It is important to stress that reaction time and immediate  response are critical for an experienced pilot to land the  helicopter safely. Avoiding flight profiles in the shaded  areas of the height/velocity diagram is not always possible.  Some jobs require flight maneuvers or tasks with prolonged  OGE operations, such as utility/power line flight, aerial  photography, logging and other occupations. Have the student  think through scenarios in which potential emergencies  occur in these profiles. Discuss possible response options the  student may have available in these scenarios.  

As instructors, we should be familiar with primacy; what  is first learned is often the first to be retained and practiced.  Take time to discuss proper takeoff and landing profiles that  minimize unnecessary exposure to these shaded areas of  the height/velocity diagram. These techniques may include  flying higher into the wind and minimizing excessive aircraft  loading. The student must consistently demonstrate these  maneuvers during each flight.  

# Performance Planning  

To make the discussion of performance planning relevant to  the student, develop a series of exercises that are scenario  based and require use of performance graphs from the POH/ RFM. Each scenario based lesson plan must have a targeted  learning point. Different scenarios can demonstrate the effect  of each environmental factor (Atmospheric Pressure, Altitude,  Temperature and Moisture) affecting density altitude.  

Figure 8-3  provides a scenario in which the student pilot  departs a near sea level location and arrives at a substantially  higher elevation. This scenario demonstrates the impact of a  greater density altitude as well as the increased IGE and OGE  power requirement to operate at that high altitude. Discuss  with the student scenarios in which OGE power may not  be available and the related consequences. Discuss aircraft  system or component limitations, such as torque versus  altitude-induced limitations or reductions in  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$    airspeeds  commonly found at higher elevations.  

At the arrival location, ensure the student accurately prepares  departure performance planning with added fuel to return  to the initial departure location (plus required reserve fuel).  

When possible, the scenarios should use high gross weight  values that best support the learning objective. If applicable,  combine the effects of external loads at higher altitudes,  temperatures and wind velocities.  

Use scenarios that provide significantly higher IGE/OGE  power requirements to demonstrate helicopter capabilities  or limitations and to determine go/no-go decisions based on  the charted values.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Take every opportunity to advance the student’s  awareness of environmental conditions. Accurate and  thorough performance planning are essential to safe  and successful flight operations. •	 Require the student to complete performance planning  prior to each training flight. This instills the habit and  highlights the importance of performance planning. •	 The student must use the appropriate POH/RFM for the  helicopter being flown for all performance planning.  This allows the student to become familiarized with  the capabilities and limitations of the particular  helicopter. •	 Remember, as an instructor, you should capitalize  on opportunities throughout training to correlate the  academic training to practical flight applications. •	 Tailor scenarios to the student’s reason for helicopter  training. Students are better able to learn when the  training takes on a meaningful role and seems more  relevant to the student’s goals. •	 Use techniques such as artificially limiting available  aircraft power. This allows the student to experience  operations in reduced performance environments  

Helicopter Performance  

# Objective  

The objective of this lesson plan is for the student to conduct performance planning, using the POH/RFM, and gain a  deeper understanding of the impact environmental conditions have on helicopter performance.  

# Content  

1. Scenario:  

You are going to depart location X with given pressure altitude, temperature, aircraft weight,  wind. Plan a flight to location Y using specific arrival conditions of pressure altitude, temperature, aircraft weight,  wind. Depart location Y with enough fuel to return to location X.  

2. Possible hazards or considerations  

• Change in gross weights, airfield elevations, temperatures, wind velocity, and direction • Effects on IGE/OGE power at higher elevations • Visibility/ceilings • Height/velocity diagram • Emergency procedures  

3. Preflight briefing  

Conduct thorough discussion with the student on the student’s flight preparation and performance planning. Use  this opportunity to reaffirm the student’s understanding of the targeted learning points. Identify and correct any  misunderstanding or weak areas.  

4. Fly the scenario (use available locations, weather, environmental data)   • Note all performance values applicable to learning points.   • Demonstrate power requirements and limitations.  

# Postflight Discussion and Debriefing  

This should include a dialogue between the instructor and student encompassing the flight planning, preparation,  and the flight. Generally, the instructor should start the discussion by identifying positive aspects of the planning and  flight, encouraging the student to be more receptive to areas needing improvement. Asking questions that generate  reflective thinking assists the instructor in evaluating the student’s assessment skills, judgment, and decision-making  skills. The instructor should encourage the student to self-critique and should assist the student in identifying  performance planning issues that may need further discussion or problem solving. Based on this analysis, the  instructor and student should discuss methods for improvement and continued awareness of these issues. Preview  and assign the next lesson. Assign  Helicopter Flying Handbook , Chapter 8, Ground Procedures and Flight   Preparations.  

• Advise on progress towards ultimate goal by starting to praise positive performacnce • Discuss items that need improvement • Discuss ways to improve newly learned skills and reinforce previously learned skills • Explain what to expect next in the training progression

while allowing for an easier escape for the instructor  while the student builds additional experience. If using  this technique, the instructor must ensure the student  is aware that it is only a simulation, and that actual  conditions can be much more challenging.  

•	 Allow the student to progress to more challenging  scenarios and simulations only after mastering the  basic fundamentals of the elements being taught.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed the effects ambient weather, weight  and environmental conditions have on performance planning  and flight operations. Additionally, this chapter provided  instructional methods to apply practical, in-flight application  of academic knowledge.  

# Chapter 9 Preflight and Postflight  Procedures  

# Introduction  

Ground operations, inspections, and checks must be  accomplished prior, during, and at the completion of any  flight. Procedures for accomplishing many of these tasks  have been developed by the manufacturer and are contained  in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) or Pilot’s Operating  Handbook (POH).  

# Checklists  

It is essential that the student understand that the purpose of  the checklist is not to provide a comprehensive procedure,  but rather to provide a systematic, sequential directory of  those tasks to be accomplished for the safe operation of the  helicopter. The student should be shown that the checklist is  derived from those procedures found in the applicable RFM/ POH.  [Figure 9-1]  

It cannot be stressed enough that the use of the checklist  ensures that items necessary for safe operation are not  overlooked or forgotten. Checklists are of no value if the  pilot is not committed to their use.  

Instructor fundamentals, such as the Law of Primacy, play a  very important role in helping the student develop routine use  

![](images/e7b676203128dcb636cf22e4e3e21054496b4f8815153c3949edbcd0792dd3c6.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.   Sample of a Robinson R22 checklist.  

of checklists. While maintaining a positive attitude, discuss  the use of checklists with the student. Demonstration and  meaningful repetition establish positive habit patterns that  the student will carry forward in all aviation applications.  

Also, demonstrate techniques that reinforce good practices.  Turning the blades to a  $90^{\circ}$   position during preflight or prior  to start, although not necessarily listed as a step for some  checklists, ensures the blades are untied and also allows for  checking correlation of flight control movement.  

As an instructor, use personal experiences to demonstrate  why steps are performed. Perhaps, while conducting a  preflight check of a fuel sample, it was learned that the sample  contained water or contaminants. This example reaffirms the  student’s need for checklist use.  

Illustrate situations where failure to follow checklist  procedures may lead to catastrophic consequences, such as  leaving the blades tied down during start, covers left on the  aircraft during start, failure to place switches in the required  position, failure to remove mooring equipment, and failure to  conduct power checks before takeoff. Each of these examples  and the resulting hazards can be discussed, showing the  impact of not using the checklist or lack of understanding  for that particular step.  

At a minimum, a well designed checklist should encompass  the following phases of flight:  

• 	 Preflight inspection • 	 Before engine start • 	 Engine start • 	 Before taxi • 	 Before takeoff • 	 After takeoff • 	 Cruise • 	 Descent • 	 Before landing • 	 After landing • 	 Engine shutdown and securing  

# Required Documents  

Emphasize to the student that a safe flight begins with a  careful inspection of the helicopter. The purpose of the  preflight inspection is two-fold:  

•	 Determine if the helicopter is legally airworthy, and •	 Determine if the helicopter is in condition for safe  flight.  

The airworthiness is determined, in part, by the certificates  and documents that must be on board the helicopter during  operation.  [Figure   $9–2J$  Educate the student on potential  liabilities and subsequent ramifications of not having verified  these documents. An excellent reference publication for a  student pilot is the Plane Sense handbook. This publication  explains the fundamental information on the requirements of  owning, operating, and maintaining a private aircraft.  

Show the student each of the following documents and  discuss where they can be found and what purpose they serve:  

•	 Airworthiness certificate (registration number,  manufacturer, serial number, category, etc.) •	 Registration certificate (eligibility, application  requirements, expiration date, etc.) •	 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio  station license, if required by the type of transmitters  on board. Refer to Title 47 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (47 CFR) part 87.18  •	 Operation limitations (which may be in the form of  a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved  RFM and/or POH placards, instrument markings, or  any combination thereof) •	 Helicopter logbooks and inspection records  

It is imperative to take the time to discuss what maintenance  inspections entail and, when listed “as required” or “if  installed,” that the student understands the applicability  of those statements. Explain calendar inspections versus  hourly inspections. If an inspection has both calendar and  hourly criteria, clarify which criteria has precedence. While  the intent is not to produce an Airframe and Powerplant  (A&P) mechanic, a pilot should demonstrate basic aviation  maintenance knowledge. Further information regarding  required documentation and inspections can be found in Title  14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91.  

# Preflight Inspection  

Preflight inspections should only be accomplished after  the instructor has conducted a thorough preflight briefing  with the student which should be done in a place free of  distractions to maximize learning and retention. If the student  has not been told exactly what to expect step by step of the  preflight inspection, they will probably be overwhelmed by  the observations and information presented to them when  conducting the inspection. A good initial preflight in a hangar  is preferable to one that is conducted on the flightline. If a  similar helicopter is disassembled for maintenance, this could  serve as a good training aid and allow the student to see the  actual part or piece of the helicopter that they may not be  able to see during an actual preflight.  

The preflight inspection should be performed in accordance  with the printed checklist provided by the manufacturer  for the specific make and model helicopter. Emphasize  that the preflight inspection of the helicopter begins while  approaching the helicopter on the ramp. Tell the student to  note the general appearance of the helicopter, looking for  obvious discrepancies, such as a landing gear out of alignment,  structural distortion, skin damage, and dripping fuel or oil  leaks. Once at the helicopter, inspection items should be  followed in the order delineated in the checklist. Caution the  student to be careful when preflighting components and to  be aware of safety wire and cotter pins which can cause cuts  

![](images/cb4b93e47051acb235e12146e16fa668023252b8a8bab7049837be7fd69e7e08.jpg)

and puncture wounds. Particular attention should be paid to  the fuel quantity, type and grade, and quality.  

Ensuring freedom of movement of the flight controls prior  to flight is essential to safety. Instruct the student not only  to physically check for freedom of movement, but also to  visually check and ensure there is nothing that could fall  and wedge against a control linkage and restrict movement.  

Explain to the student that the helicopter should have the  required equipment for the type of flight to be flown. Required  equipment can be found in 14 CFR section 91.205. Refer the  student to 14 CFR section 91.213 regarding the minimum  equipment list (MEL) for the helicopter. Discuss the purpose  of the MEL, what items may be on the list, and the applicable  limitations for instruments and equipment.  

# Cockpit Management  

While discussing cockpit management, it is important for the  student to understand that aircraft control is always the first  priority. In doing so, continue to instruct the basics of cockpit  management. Ensure the student has all required equipment,  documents, checklists, performance data, and navigation  charts for the flight. Show the student how to organize these  items to ensure they remain secured throughout the flight, as  well as in the order of use.  

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of kneeboards  and other document retention devices. (It is important for  the instructor to note that the physical placement of such  items can impact the student’s flight dexterity or control.  For example, a kneeboard on the right leg may interfere  with the student’s right hand and cyclic grip; on the left  leg it may interfere with the collective.) Some document  collection devices are bulky and may become hazardous  if not properly stowed and/or secured. Another concern is  operations with the doors removed, a luxury of helicopter  flight that can potentially turn into a hazard. Secure all items  before starting engines.  

If a portable intercom, headset, or a hand-held global  positioning system (GPS) is used, ensure that the routing  of wires and cables does not interfere with the operation of  flight controls. The pilot must retain the necessary freedom  of movement to reach for radios, etc. Emphasis should be  placed on the necessity for a pilot to be thoroughly familiar  with all aircraft systems, switch functions, switch locations,  control locations, and control functions, particularly for night  operations. This is especially critical in helicopters because  the pilot normally has both hands and both feet engaged in  controlling the helicopter. Discuss procedures for applying  friction to the controls to allow changing radio frequencies  and other functions that require removing a hand from a  flight control.  

In a static aircraft, have the student conduct a “dry run” of  sequencing through the material he or she has organized.  This can be incorporated into practical lessons involving  Before Engine Start, Engine Start, Before Taxiing, and  Hover Checks. Have the student conduct mock radio calls  and performance planning checks; all these tasks require  organizational forethought of needed items, checklists, and  publications. This ground instruction of cockpit management  allows the student to focus on controlling the aircraft in flight  rather than diverting attention to organizing in flight.  

Once training has progressed to in-flight tasks, stress the  importance of when and where to make calls and when and  where to change frequencies, always focusing on controlling  the aircraft first. Give situational examples, such as, “Do not  wait until after you have entered Class B, C, or D airspace  to organize the required publications, maps, checklists, and  radio frequencies.” The student should strive to think several  minutes ahead of the aircraft.  

During flight training, there must always be a clear  understanding between the student and flight instructor of  who has control of the aircraft. Prior to any dual training  flight, a briefing should be conducted that includes the  procedure for the exchange of flight controls. The following  three-step process for the exchange of flight controls is  highly recommended. When a flight instructor wishes the  student to take control of the aircraft, he or she should say  to the student, “You have the flight controls.” The student  should acknowledge immediately by saying, “I have the flight  controls.” The flight instructor confirms by again saying,  “You have the flight controls.” Only when the other pilot has  confirmed he or she has the controls, will you relinquish the  controls.  [Figure 9-3]  

![](images/99d6e95257b277659824d2f242f082654300541e64123b318d366098ce54c9d5.jpg)  
Figure 9-3.   Exchanging flight controls.  

Part of the procedure should be a visual check to ensure the  other person actually has the flight controls. When returning  the controls to the flight instructor, the student should follow  the same procedure the instructor used when giving control  to the student. The student should stay on the controls until  the instructor says: “I have the flight controls.” There should  never be any doubt as to who is flying the helicopter at any  time. Numerous accidents have occurred due to a lack of  communication or a misunderstanding about who actually  had control of the aircraft, particularly between student and  flight instructor. It is imperative that the student understands  that the term “flight controls” is used in this procedure. A  common point of confusion occurs when the pilot not flying  announces a hazard to flight. For example, “I have the traffic.”  is construed to mean, “I have the traffic and the controls.”  The pilot flying the aircraft relinquishes the flight controls,  misunderstanding the statement, and now is probably focused  outside, looking for the traffic. At this point, no one is flying  the aircraft! Establishing the above three-step process during  initial training ensures the formation of a very beneficial  habit pattern.  

# Ground Operations  

Instructors should describe in detail the process for  ground handling and movement of helicopters on the  ground in preparation for flight. Show the student where  the manufacturer’s recommended procedures for ground  handling are found in the RFM. This discussion should  include removal from typical storage locations, such as  trailers and hangars, towing options, taxiing options, and  choice of a launch area.  

The rotor downwash from a helicopter can cause considerable  damage to persons, property, and other aircraft. Ensure the  student understands the importance of coordinating with all  interested parties, including airport management, landowners,  and other aircraft operators prior to conducting helicopter  operations.  

It is important a student understands the importance of  operating a helicopter safely on the ground. This includes  being familiar with standard hand signals that are used by  ramp personnel and traffic control light signals from the  control tower.  [Figures 9-4  and  9-5]  

Instructors should direct the student to the AIM for more  information on hand signals and task the student to practice  proper hand signals with another student. Hands-on  experience and practice better reinforces the material and  increases retention. To familiarize the student with control  

![](images/86f2fc9de4d5af3a7892d2881b10bd75d965265f4dd8db1641c9a2efa8403ef6.jpg)  
Figure 9-4.   Hand signals.  

![](images/aed831c2f7eba89a586f601c32bcdb279eb6a8d31622241f63a2cbd1024314d7.jpg)  

light signals from the control tower, the instructor can request  the different signals from the tower over the radio so the  student can see the real light signals. Tower windows are  often tinted, which causes light colors to appear a slightly  different color. As the student progresses, ask the student  what signal to expect and arrange with the tower to delay the  light signal some time after the radio transmission to allow  the student to respond to the instructor.  

The pilot needs to brief passengers and ground personnel.  In addition to the required information in the regulations,  the student should learn to tell ground personnel where  the helicopter would go in case of malfunction, always to  approach from a forward side of the helicopter, and approach  only after acknowledgment by the pilot.  

Many rotors can dip to as low as 4 feet off the surface.  Usually, the forward portion of the main rotor dips the lowest  to the ground, so approaching from the very front of the  helicopter is usually not a safe route. Pilots should be taught  to teach personnel never to come to the rear of a helicopter,  except in the case of the BV-234/KV-107 to which rear access  is safer. Special precautions must be taught for the BO-105  and BK 117 due to their rear access. Tail rotors have killed  and injured as many people as airplane propellers.  

Students should learn to keep their hands, arms, and hats down,  and to be careful of long poles, tripods, survey targets, antennas,  etc. No one should ever chase a hat that has blown away.  

It is safest to stay in the helicopter until the blades stop or  stand by the operations area until the blades stop, but often  impractical due to other constraints. By the same token, the  pilot should ensure that passengers are briefed to stay inside  the airframe until the blades stop in the unlikely case that an  unplanned event occurs.  

Unlike airplanes, it is quite common for a passenger to be  sitting in the front seat and be able to place a camera or other  type obstruction around the collective, even when the dual  controls are removed. The pilot should always ensure that  any doors are closed and completely latched. Accidents have  occurred when objects fell out of aft cabins or cargo bays  and struck tail rotors.  

If the helicopter is being flown with doors removed, this  precaution is especially necessary.  

# Engine Start  

Discuss in detail the process of engine starting and initial  operation. Stress the importance of using the engine start  procedure recommended by the manufacturer in the RFM.  Emphasize the hazards associated with engine start and blade  rotation or rotor engagement.  

Take time to show the student the reason for certain steps,  such as electrical sequencing or throttle positioning. Most  helicopters have steps in place to prevent possible damage  to electrical systems or to prevent inadvertent fuel flow to  the engine. Spend time with the student, enhancing his or her  knowledge of these systems through explanation of these steps.  

Unlike a fixed-wing aircraft, the helicopter has a   $360^{\circ}$  hazard area due to the main and tail rotors. Remember, it  takes many flight hours and years of aviation exposure for  the student to learn what an instructor already knows. Some  things are learned from observation. As an instructor, take  the time to demonstrate the flexibility of the main rotor and  the minimum height it may droop. Also, use this opportunity  to discuss approaching a running helicopter, the dangers of  a drooping main rotor, and the effects of sloping or rising  terrain. When possible, show the student the “invisible” tail  rotor in operation. The high rpm of the tail rotor makes it  virtually invisible to those unaware of its hazard.  

Explain to the student that, whenever possible, the pilot must  attempt to park the helicopter so the tail rotor is away from  the most common access path to and from the helicopter. In  addition to the invisible aspect of the tail rotor, the student  should be advised to remember the tail rotor intake side  (typically on the right side) does not warn the person by  blowing wind in their face or make as much noise as the  thrusting side of the tail rotor.  

Prior to engine start, and while the student is sitting in the  cockpit, have him or her look   $90^{\circ}$   to both sides and point  out the distances needed for the helicopter to clear objects.  Reinforce the clearances and visual appearances needed for  safe flight along with the limited field of view from the cockpit.  

Ensure the student understands engine overspeed or hot start  procedures prior to engine start. Prior to engaging the starter  or rotor system, caution the student to ensure:  

•	 The helicopter is cleared   $360^{\circ}$  •	 A call out of “CLEAR” is made •	 A response has been made from anyone who might  be near the helicopter  

After starting procedures, conduct a thorough discussion and  demonstration of operational checks in accordance with the  checklist.  [Figure 9-6]  

# Taxiing  

Instructors should place emphasis on the fact that a pilot  should look outside the helicopter to the sides, as well as to  the front, any time the helicopter is moving under its own  power on the surface. The student must be aware of the entire  area around the helicopter to ensure it remains well clear of  all obstructions and other aircraft.  

Explain the effects of wind on power requirements and  the tail rotor and include a discussion of loss of tail rotor  effectiveness (LTE). Students should be thoroughly familiar  with the terms taxi, hover taxi, and air taxi.  

A helicopter’s unique abilities allow the pilot flexibility in  maneuvering the helicopter. Do not allow that flexibility  to lead to poor judgment. Think ahead of the helicopter  movement. For example, if there are strong winds, it would  be a good time for the instructor to instill the future planning  requirements by asking the student where the tail rotor is and  what the effects of the strong winds are. Another example is  system malfunction. Instructors should constantly be asking  the student, “What would you do if the system malfunctioned  right now?” Talking through these types of scenarios and  emergencies helps the student prepare for an actual situation  by rehearsing reactions, which could save a life. If in a  controlled airspace environment, ensure the student pilot  understands the taxi instructions prior to acknowledging  them. Too frequently, pilots acknowledge instructions  without fully understanding those instructions, potentially  leading to confusion and/or mishaps.  

Additional information related to taxiing helicopters can be  found in the Helicopter Flying Handbook, Chapter 10, Basic  Maneuvers, and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM),  Chapter 4, Aerodynamics.  

# Before Takeoff  

Explain to the student that the before-takeoff check is a  systematic procedure for making a check of the engine,  controls, systems, instruments, and avionics prior to flight.  [Figure 9-7]  It is normally performed before taxiing to  a position near the takeoff point. Emphasize that while  performing the before-takeoff check, the student divides  his or her attention between the inside and outside of the  helicopter. It is at this point that the instructor can determine  if the student has retained any discussion in cockpit  management. Does the student have a plan for the many  actions required while conducting the before takeoff checks?  Remind the student that each helicopter has different features  and equipment, which is why the takeoff checklist provided  by the manufacturer or operator is used to perform the checks.  

# After Landing  

Impress upon the student that after-landing checks, if required  by the RFM, should be completed using the manufacturer’s  established procedures. Movement of the helicopter to the  parking area is accomplished according to instructions  received from the tower or ground control. Remind the  student that, at uncontrolled landing areas, it is the pilot’s  responsibility to ensure the helicopter does not present a  safety hazard to persons or property on the ground. Helicopter  pilots must always be aware of the extent of damage that the  rotorwash can cause if aircraft and property are not secured  properly. If the pilot is ever in doubt, request an alternate  route or detour around the airfield if there appears to be loose  items that will be affected by the rotorwash.  

# Parking  

Advise the student that whenever possible, the helicopter  should be parked   $90^{\circ}$   from the actual or forecast winds.

Figure 9-6.   Sample checklist for engine start.  

# Before-Takeoff Checks  

Prior to takeoff, the pilot shall consider the following items, and brief the passenger(s), as appropriate:  

1. Hydraulics – ON 2. GOV – ON/RPM – 100% 3. Clear area (left, right, overhead) 4. Check gauges (engine, transmission, fuel) 5. Transponder – ON/Alt  

Ensure the student understands that exceptions may be  necessary under strong wind conditions (particular attention  must be observed to avoid potential damage to the rotor head  and/or tail boom). If possible, demonstrate alternate options.  

Unless parking in a designated, supervised area, the student  should be instructed to select a location and heading that  prevents the propeller or jet blast of other airplanes from  striking the helicopter broadside. Do not allow the student  to become complacent. The flight is not complete until  completion of all tasks and the pilot is walking away from  the aircraft.  

# Engine Shutdown  

It is essential to stress the importance of following the  checklist during engine shutdown. As the training flight nears  completion, it is human nature to relax, becoming inattentive.  The instructor must take time to go through the shutdown with  the student, noting reasons for certain steps. For example,  depending on the type of engine (reciprocating or turbine),  different cool-down periods are necessary to prevent material  damage to the internal components. What is learned first is  most often retained; educate the student on the specifics and  purpose of steps pertaining to the powerplant in use.  

Additionally, certain steps are performed to identify possible  system faults. For instance, if the helicopter uses a step to  check battery voltage, explain why the check is performed.  Another very common cooling time check is to turn off the  fuel boost pumps and ensure the engine keeps running. A line  leak or faulty component will kill the engine then, requiring  repair prior to the next flight. The student should not be  allowed to conduct shutdown procedures from memory.  

# Postflight  

Point out that a flight is never complete until the engine  is shut down, rotors have stopped, and the helicopter is  secured. When the rotors have stopped, the pilot then  carries out a postflight inspection to include checking the  general condition of the aircraft. Stress to the student that  the postflight procedure is an essential part of any flight.  Although not meant to be a thorough inspection, the postflight  is no less important. Discrepancies noted on postflight allow  maintenance personnel more time to make appropriate repairs  and prepare the aircraft for subsequent flights.  

Using experience, point out common or frequent trends  found during postflight. Ask the student or have the student  question what he or she may see. Are the fluid levels within  limits? Are they at the same level as checked on preflight?  Point out the concern over possible foreign object damage  (FOD), specifically on the main and tail rotor blades and  undercarriage. Observe any fluid or debris on the engine  or transmission decks. Are fluids present on the ground or  along the fuselage?  

Show the student how to make appropriate entries in the  aircraft logbook. Explain how vague entries cause confusion  and to be descriptive in noting discrepancies. Also, discuss  what policies or duties may be the pilot’s responsibility,  such as cleaning the cockpit area or windows. Demonstrate  the correct method and materials to be used, if applicable.  

# Securing and Servicing  

When a flight is completed, the aircraft should be hangared or  tied down and the rotor blades secured. Tying the blades down  in the same manner each time instills positive habit transfer  and awareness of tie-down and cover stowage and location.  Ensure that the battery is off and have the student note the  fuel level at the completion of the flight and ensure refuel  is accomplished if necessary. Refer the student to the RFM  for the procedures used to service and secure the helicopter.  

# Instructor Tip  

Remember, instructors are role models for student pilots.  Make the use of checklists meaningful to the student by  demonstrating the importance and reasons for each step. By  using checklists on a regular basis, the instructor’s actions  underscore the importance of relying on checklists rather  than memory.  [Figure 9-8]  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter described those flight preparations and ground  procedures normally associated with helicopter flight. In this  discussion, particular emphasis was placed on the use of the  manufacturer’s procedures and checklists in accomplishing  various functions. For additional information in any of these  areas, refer to the RFM for the helicopter being flown.  

Using Checklists

# Chapter 10 Basic Flight Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

This chapter provides information to help the instructor  explain and demonstrate basic flight maneuvers to students.  Since instructors often forget the difficulties they encountered  in mastering various flight maneuvers, this chapter is designed  as a teaching aid to refresh the instructor’s memory of the  difficulties involved in learning various helicopter maneuvers.  

#  

# Basic Maneuvers  

Basic flight maneuvers consist of five fundamental modes  of flight: straight-and-level, turns, climbs, descents, and  hovering. A student should understand that all maneuvers are  based on one or a combination of these fundamental modes.  Inform the student that the Practical Test Standards (PTS)  establish the minimum standards or acceptable limits for the  performance of each maneuver.  

Prior to flight, a briefing should be conducted that includes  the training to be accomplished, crew responsibilities in the  event of an emergency, and the procedure for the exchange of  flight controls. A positive three-step process in the exchange  of flight controls between pilots is a proven procedure and  one that is strongly recommended.  

Note: Beginning with hover training as the first helicopter  maneuver may be unwise. The student has not had the  opportunity to learn how the helicopter reacts to control  inputs. Learning control inputs for the first time three feet  above the ground is unsettling for most. One option is for  the instructor to take the student up to altitude and allow  that student to become comfortable with the helicopter flight  controls. Once the student is comfortable with the flight  controls, proceed to lower and slower flight until hovering  is finally achieved.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

It is important that the student be able to maintain a constant  heading, altitude, and airspeed. Explain and demonstrate that  straight-and-level flight is actually a series of small corrections  needed to maintain the original attitude and heading following  natural deviations caused by inadvertent control inputs or  turbulence. The attitude required to maintain straight-and- level flight should be clearly defined using all available visual  aids. One aid is the distance between the horizon and the  tip-path plane of the rotor system.  [Figure 10-1]  

![](images/b2df9bd6d85b7fd89a352180abfbce566c934f5f58c41623dc9d84a0256dff07.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.   Maintain a straight-and-level altitude by keeping the  tip-path plane parallel to and a constant distance above or below  the natural horizon.  

Roll attitude can be determined by using the tip-path plane  or a canopy crossbar and its relation to the natural horizon.  

Prominent objects on the ground should be used for heading  reference. This encourages the student to look outside instead  of concentrating too much on the instruments. While the  student is gaining proficiency in straight-and-level flight,  power is usually not adjusted once it is set, in order to  maintain the desired cruise power.  

# Instructional Points  

It is important that the student learn to recognize the  correct attitude for various flight maneuvers. The attitude  of the helicopter usually indicates the rate of acceleration  or deceleration of the helicopter and the airspeed, and is  controlled by the cyclic. Altitude is primarily controlled by  the use of the collective. To maintain forward flight, the rotor  tip-path plane must be tilted forward to obtain the necessary  horizontal thrust component from the main rotor. This  usually results in an initially nose-low attitude. Due to the  horizontal stabilizer, once the helicopter stabilizes in flight,  the helicopter’s fuselage will tend to return to a neutral, level  attitude. The attitude of the helicopter should not be confused  with the position of the rotor disk relative to the horizon. The  lower the nose rotor disk is, the greater the power is that is  required to maintain altitude, and the higher the resulting  airspeeds. Conversely, the greater the power used, the lower  the rotor disk must be to maintain at altitude. Since the  helicopter is suspended beneath the rotor system, the angle  of attack of the wings is not determined by the airframe’s  pitch as in an airplane. The horizontal stabilizer streamlines  the helicopter airframe for reduced drag by applying more  down force as airspeed increases, thereby raising the nose  to a level (or almost level) cruising attitude.  

Show the student, while in straight-and-level flight, any  increase in the collective also increases the airspeed and  altitude, due to an increase in lift and thrust. A decrease  in the collective while holding airspeed constant causes a  helicopter to descend. A change in the collective requires  a coordinated change of the throttle to maintain a constant  rpm. (In this handbook, all throttle discussions refer to  helicopters without a governor or correllator.) Additionally,  the antitorque pedals need to be adjusted to maintain heading  and keep the helicopter in longitudinal trim.  

To increase airspeed in straight-and-level flight, instruct the  student to apply forward pressure on the cyclic and raise  the collective as necessary to maintain altitude. To decrease  airspeed, the student needs to apply rearward pressure on  the cyclic and lower the collective as necessary to maintain  altitude. The student should be guided to notice the yawing  resulting from the changing of the torque and airflows over  the vertical stabilizer as equipped, and make sufficient  changes to maintain the heading and trim.  

Once the student has maintained a specific altitude and  airspeed with little deviation, point out that the helicopter’s  altitude and airspeed remain constant with a constant power  setting. Small adjustments may be required to compensate  for turbulence, but ensure the student uses outside references  and does not focus on instruments alone. Assess the position  of the rotor disk relative to the natural horizon. The attitude  of the helicopter due to the influence of the horizontal  stabilizer will approximate a consistent “level attitude” when  not accelerating or decelerating. Also, heading is easier to  maintain if the student at some point looks outside in line with  the intended flightpath. Looking outside fulfills another very  important task—scanning for other traffic and obstructions.  

To prevent overcontrolling, teach control pressures and not  movements. This is especially true in the first few lessons  when the student is concentrating on control input and how  the helicopter reacts.  

# Common Student Difficulties Visualizing Attitude  

The forward seating position and the excellent visibility  in most helicopters may make it difficult for a student to  visualize the attitude of the helicopter. It is important that  the instructor provide all the assistance possible to ensure the  student can determine an attitude by some visual reference.  Instructors usually develop different methods of teaching  attitude references.  

# Overcontrolling  

Two factors contribute to overcontrolling the helicopter, the  most common difficulty for the beginning student. First, the  student fails to notice attitude deviation until it becomes rather  large. Second, in the attempt to recover to level attitude, too  much control is applied because a student is not prepared for  the helicopter’s quick response to control inputs. Generally,  the beginning student does not know when to remove a  control input and usually holds it until after the required  attitude is passed. This results in an overshoot, followed by  another large control application, another overshoot, and so  on. Explain that controls are operated by pressure rather than  movement, and it is not necessary to return immediately to  the level attitude. As soon as the student understands these  two items and loses the sense of urgency, overcontrolling  diminishes. It is also helpful to remind a student that when  a deviation from the desired attitude is noticed, the proper  technique is to first stop the deviation, then make a smooth  correction to return to the original attitude.  

# Trim  

To reduce control pressures in helicopters with electric trim,  it is imperative to have the helicopter properly trimmed  before the student takes control, otherwise the term control  pressure is meaningless. When the helicopter is out of trim,  some control pressure must be held just to maintain the  desired attitude and any instruction to relax control pressure  can only lead to confusion. If the helicopter has an electric  trim (especially the “coolie hat” type), the student should be  shown how it functions before starting the engine and turning  the blades. If installed, have the student use the trim and  remind him or her to always trim the pressures off. The on/ off type (force trim) is often of less value and very often just  left off by experienced pilots as a personal preference. When  trim is mentioned in this handbook, it is in reference to the  antitorque trim of the helicopter unless otherwise indicated.  

# Coordination  

Most beginning students have difficulty relating the effect  one control has on another. The most obvious of these is the  change in torque as power is changed, requiring the use of  antitorque pedal pressure as power is varied. Less obvious  is the effect of a power change on pitch attitude in forward  flight due to gyroscopic precession and differential lift on  the advancing and retreating blades. As power is increased  with the collective, the nose tends to pitch up; as power is  decreased, the nose pitches down. As speed is increased, the  nose of the helicopter tends to rise and begin a roll towards  the retreating blade. These effects can be most disconcerting  to the student unless the instructor thoroughly explains and  demonstrates them.  

# Scan  

To correct a deviation, it must first be recognized. Most  beginning students tend to devote all of their attention to a  specific problem. For example, full attention may be devoted  to an altitude problem while the helicopter drifts off heading  or the airspeed changes. Students may also fail to see other  aircraft or obstacles in the vicinity if their attention is fixed  on a single item. Some instructors find it helpful to call out  or point to the items that should be included in the scan  pattern. This helps the student build a good habitual scan. It  is important that the student be taught to include the engine  instruments in the scan, so an impending engine problem  does not go undetected.  

# Kinesthesia  

The sense of motion and pressure changes through nerve  endings and muscular sensations is scientifically named  kinesthesia, but is commonly called seat-of-the-pants flying.  This sense can be developed more rapidly if the instructor  calls attention to the sensations as they occur. Development  of this sense enables a student to become aware of changes in  the helicopter’s attitude more quickly. Point out to the student  the importance of the other senses as well. The sounds of the  engine, rotor, and transmission give information of rpm and  possible mechanical problems. Seeing (vision) allows us  to fly safely, maintaining level flight with the horizon and/ or the instruments. Unusual smells while in flight may be  indications of something getting hot or burning within the  helicopter. Touch may be the pressure-counterpressure that  we exert on the antitorque pedals or the amount of cyclic  input to maintain flight profiles.  

# Normal Climb  

The objectives in practicing climbs are to achieve proficiency  in establishing a climb attitude and airspeed, setting climb  power while maintaining a specified rpm, and coordinating  the use of flight controls. Proficiency is also gained by  understanding the techniques used in leveling off at a  designated altitude and establishing level cruise flight.  

# Instructional Points  

For both climbs and descents, focus on:  

1.	 Transitioning from one power setting to another  (cruise power to climb power, then back to cruise  power; for the descent, cruise power to approach  power, then back to cruise power, if desired). 2.	 Coordinating the controls as a result of a power  change. 3. 	 Clearing the helicopter above or below prior to  initiating a climb or descent.  

To enter a constant airspeed climb from cruise airspeed,  simultaneously increase the collective and throttle rpm to  obtain climb power. Adjust antitorque pedals to maintain  helicopter in yaw trim.  

Note: In a counterclockwise rotor system, a left pedal input  is required for an increase in torque (right pedal for a torque  decrease).  

An increase in power causes the helicopter to start climbing,  and only slight back pressure on the cyclic is required to  change from a level to a climb attitude.  

NOTE: Discuss with the student how helicopter design affects  climb and descent attitudes. For example, some helicopters  are designed to increase the usable CG range of the helicopter  at higher airspeeds. Nose-high or nose-low attitudes are also  based on load conditions or aircraft designs. Therefore, climb  attitude is slightly different from one helicopter design to the  other. Point out to the student that simply pulling aft cyclic  (while in cruise flight) initiates a climb and, in a short period  of time, airspeed lowers and a descent begins. If the available  lift/thrust is completely converted to vertical lift by using aft  cyclic, the helicopter will begin descending when it slows  enough to lose translational lift. This is not the coordinated  climb that you are attempting to achieve. While in cruise  flight, forward cyclic initiates a descent and, in a short period  of time, your airspeed increases. However, depending on  altitude, this could result in retreating blade stall. These types  of maneuvers are discouraged during training so the student  can learn to control the helicopter within stated parameters.  This results in a better trained pilot with better skills.  

As the airspeed approaches normal climb airspeed, adjust  the cyclic to hold this airspeed. Throughout the maneuver,  maintain climb attitude, heading, and airspeed with the  cyclic; climb power and rpm with the collective and throttle;  and yaw trim with the antitorque pedals. To level off from a  climb, start adjusting the attitude to the level flight attitude  a few feet prior to reaching the desired altitude. The amount  of lead depends on the rate of climb at the time of level off  (the higher the rate of climb, the more the lead). Generally,  the lead is 10 percent of the climb rate. For example, if your  climb rate is 500 feet per minute, you should lead the level-off  by 50 feet. To begin the level-off, adjust cyclic to adjust and  maintain a cruise flight attitude. You should maintain climb  power until the airspeed approaches the desired cruising  airspeed, then lower the collective to obtain cruising power  and adjust the throttle to obtain and maintain cruising rpm.  Throughout the level-off, maintain yaw trim and heading  with the antitorque pedals. The instructor should remind  the student of the effects of inertia, which require some lead  time and efforts. Just as one applies the brakes in a car before  a stop sign, a pilot should apply control inputs prior to the  desired point, be that an altitude or heading.  

# Common Student Difficulties Attitude  

As in straight-and-level flight, students frequently have  difficulty visualizing and establishing the proper attitude  for the climb. Use whatever references are available in the  helicopter, such as the tip-path plane, canopy crossbars, or  any other structural reference. Depending on the helicopter,  horizontal stabilizer, and rate of change in altitude, the climb  attitude may be the same as the cruise attitude, or slightly  higher.  

# Overcontrolling  

The difficulty in establishing the correct climb airspeed  may be the result of overcontrolling. Since establishing  the correct airspeed is usually accomplished by a series  of pitch attitude adjustments, students may not hold the  attitude long enough for the airspeed to stabilize. This leads  to excessive maneuvering while chasing the airspeed. At  this point, frustration and tension begin to build. When it  becomes apparent that the student is getting frustrated, the  instructor can try one of the following three things; have  the student return to straight-and-level flight, take over for  a brief demonstration while the student relaxes, or allow the  student to continue climbing until they achieve a stabilized  climb and perceive the sight picture and control pressures.  If climbing to an altitude is too complicated, just strive for a  coordinated climb at first. Instructors should never be afraid  to break any maneuver down to it component parts and allow  the student to practice those individual skills until they are  ready to assemble those skills into a complete maneuver.  

# Coordination  

In the process of beginning a climb, all controls are utilized.  Each control input causes something else to change,  and a beginning student may have difficulty, not only in  accomplishing the actions in the proper sequence, but also  in compensating for control inputs. During the level-off,  some students have a tendency to decrease power before  adjusting attitude (cyclic) for cruise flight. Talk the student  through the maneuver to remove any doubt about what is to  be accomplished, as well as how and when it is done.  

# Scan  

The scan pattern mentioned in straight-and-level flight  becomes more important when the flight condition is  constantly changing. Several things are happening at once  and the task becomes more difficult unless the student has  rehearsed the actions and reactions of the helicopter.  

# Normal Descent  

A normal descent is a maneuver in which the helicopter  loses altitude at a controlled rate in a controlled attitude.  The objective in practicing descents is to gain proficiency  in establishing the attitude necessary to maintain the desired  airspeed, setting power as required to maintain the desired  rate of descent while maintaining a constant rotor rpm and  correcting for changing torque.  

# Instructional Points  

To establish a normal descent from straight-and-level flight  at cruising airspeed, lower the collective to obtain proper  power, adjust the throttle to maintain rpm (a slight amount of  cyclic adjustment is normally necessary to maintain desired  airspeed), and adjust antitorque pedals to maintain heading.  Throughout the maneuver, maintain descending attitude and  airspeed with the cyclic, descending power and rpm with  the collective and throttle, and yaw trim with the antitorque  pedals. To level off from the descent, lead the desired  altitude by approximately 10 percent of the rate of descent.  For example, a descent rate of 500 feet per minute would  require a 50-foot lead. At this point, increase the collective  to obtain cruising power, adjust the throttle to maintain rpm,  adjust antitorque pedals to maintain yaw trim, and adjust the  cyclic to obtain cruising airspeed and a level flight attitude.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

# Attitude  

Visualization of pitch attitude may be difficult for the  student in the initial stages of flight training. Make use of  any available reference points on the helicopter in order to  maintain some sort of visual reference. Helicopter attitude  is primary for acceleration and deceleration control. The  airspeed indicator is going to be the primary indicator for  airspeed control. If the airspeed is slow, then the nose must  be lowered to accelerate the helicopter until the airspeed  increases. As the airspeed increases, the pilot must plan on  indicator delays and allow the helicopter attitude to stabilize  and neutralize equilibrium at the desired airspeed. The  descent attitude may be the same as the level attitude was  once the helicopter is stabilized in the descent.  

# Coordination  

The student may have difficulty adjusting throttle and  antitorque pedals while simultaneously adjusting the  collective to set descent power. Emphasize that power is to  be changed slowly and smoothly to minimize coordination  problems.  

# Scan  

It is common for a student to concentrate on one factor to the  exclusion of others. Students have difficulty with two areas in  this maneuver: maintaining a constant angle of descent and  leading the level-off sufficiently. These two problems often  result in recovery below the desired altitude.  

# Turns  

Turns are practiced to develop skill in establishing and  maintaining a desired angle of bank, while holding the pitch  attitude that is appropriate to the desired maneuver. Level  turns are practiced first, using bank angles of approximately   $15{-}20^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 10-2]  As the student is developing his or  

![](images/4ae71d13683197eb363655f4c8fab3f3c63a6d6c518f27c8ddedf8218bc9d890.jpg)  
Figure 10-2.   During a level, coordinated turn, the rate of turn  is commensurate with the angle of bank used, and inertia and  horizontal component of lift (HCL) are equal.  

her skills, turns should be practiced at different airspeeds.  As the student progresses, turns at   $\mathrm{V_{H}}$   or   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   should be  added to the program as well as turns below effective  translational lift. Care should be exercised to avoid LTE  at low altitudes. If possible, a demonstration of LTE at  higher altitudes is a good teaching point for the new student.  

# Instructional Points  

Before making any turns, make sure the student clears the  area in the direction of the turn, as well as above and below  the helicopter.  

To enter a turn from straight-and-level flight, apply sideward  pressure on the cyclic in the direction the turn is to be made.  This is the only control movement needed to start the turn.  Antitorque pedals are not used to assist the turn. Airplane  pilots transitioning to helicopters attempt to use the antitorque  pedals as they would a rudder pedal. Use the pedals only to  compensate for torque to keep the helicopter in yaw trim.  

How fast the helicopter banks depends on how much lateral  cyclic pressure is applied. How far the helicopter banks (the  steepness of the bank) depends on how long the cyclic is  displaced. After establishing the proper bank angle, return  the cyclic toward the neutral position. Explain to the student  that the cyclic tilts the rotor disk relative to the horizon. The  amount of tilt or bank depends on how much and how long  the cyclic is displaced from perpendicular to the horizon. The  rotor disk always follows the cyclic. As the pilot places the  cyclic in a neutral position in relation to the helicopter, the  cyclic is simply maintaining the rotor disk tilt as referenced  to the horizon and the helicopter follows the rotor. Returning  the cyclic to the neutral position simply stops the bank (rotor  tilt) from increasing or decreasing.  

Use the collective and throttle to maintain altitude and rpm.  As the torque increases, apply more pressure to the proper  antitorque pedal to maintain longitudinal trim. Depending on  the degree of bank, additional forward cyclic pressure may  be required to maintain airspeed.  

When rolling out of a turn, the cyclic is moved back to  perpendicular to the horizon, which brings the rotor back to  level with the horizon. Lead or lag on the rollout is necessary  to complete the maneuver on the desired heading.  

# Common Student Difficulties Attitude  

Visualization of the bank angle is one of the most common  problems for students. The angle between the tip-path plane  and the horizon should always remain stable and consistent  when banking or turning the helicopter. As the bank angle is  established and the perspective changes, there is a tendency  to use the center of the canopy as the pitch reference. It must  be emphasized that the correct pitch reference is directly in  front of the student. The pitch reference point should remain  stationary as the helicopter is rolled into the bank, with a  helicopter appearing to pivot around the pitch reference.  The correct pitch attitude is confirmed by reference to the  altimeter and a level turn. If the student attempts to maintain  altitude solely by reference to the altimeter, overcontrolling  usually results and the student begins chasing the altitude.  

# Leaning Away From a Turn  

There is a natural tendency to keep the body, or at least  the head, level. When the student leans away from the  turn, perspective changes, making it even more difficult to  maintain the correct attitude.  

# Failure to Clear the Area  

The student is frequently so occupied with the problems  associated with maintaining altitude, airspeed, bank angle,  etc., that the responsibility of seeing and avoiding other  aircraft is neglected. Clearing the area in the direction of the  turn must be included in the items the instructor calls out  while talking the student through the maneuver.  

Stress to the student that clearing of the helicopter is  continuous. Other traffic occupies the same airspace such as  traffic helicopters, crop dusters, rescue, police, power-line  patrols and many others. If operating near military training  areas, remind the student of low level VFR and IFR routes and  the increase in flight activity. Birds or anything above ground  level (towers, power lines, etc.) present flight hazards as well.  

# Rolling Out of a Turn  

Difficulties associated with rolling out of a turn are usually  related to scan problems. The student who is preoccupied with  other factors often loses track of heading. Select a prominent  landmark and instruct a student to anticipate the rollout by  an amount equal to about half the bank angle.  

# Climbing and Descending Turns  

Climbing and descending turns are used to further develop  control and coordination. They also provide the practice  required for departures and landing approaches.  

# Instructional Points  

As always, before making any turns, clear the helicopter in the  direction of the turn, as well as above and below the helicopter.  

The turn and climb/descent are usually initiated simultaneously.  Until the student gains proficiency, it may be easier first to  establish each maneuver separately. For example, to enter a  climbing/descending turn, establish the turn first then adjust  the controls for the climb/descent. You may reverse the  order as well, with enough practice the student will learn  to simultaneously perform the required control inputs to  accomplish a climbing/descending turn.  

# Common Student Difficulties Attitude  

Combining turns with climbs/descents introduces new  helicopter attitudes and the initial perception of these attitudes  may be difficult for the student to comprehend. A thorough  briefing and demonstration minimizes this problem. The  first climbing/descending turns should be established by  beginning the climb/descent and then rolling into the desired  bank angle in order to reduce the number of simultaneous  control movements required.  

# Scan  

As with the previous maneuvers, the scan pattern is easily  interrupted by concentrating on a specific aspect of the  maneuver. During early practice of climbing/descending  turns, the instructor should call out all the items that require  attention, even if no correction is required. As proficiency  improves, the instructor should call attention only to the items  that require corrective action.  

# Coordination Exercises  

Once level flight, turns, climbs, and descents have been  introduced, coordination exercises should be practiced to assist  a student in developing subconscious coordinated control  and proficiency. A good exercise to teach compensation  for power changes is to make airspeed changes while  maintaining straight-and-level flight. At a safe altitude, and  while maintaining a constant rpm, altitude, and heading, have  the student reduce airspeed to 40 knots by simultaneously  applying aft cyclic and reducing power. Now, instruct the  student to accelerate to approximately 80 knots by increasing  forward cyclic and power. The maneuver may be repeated,  as necessary, for proficiency. During these maneuvers,  allowing a stable flight for a few moments and pointing out  the helicopter’s attitude at the different airspeeds will help  the student become familiar with that particular helicopter’s  attitudes set by the horizontal stabilizer for those airspeeds  and loads. There may be an 11 percent change in the weight  of some helicopters when the instructor deboards for the  student’s first solo flight, and a considerable sight picture  change with that much weight out of one side of the helicopter.  

Another exercise that develops smoothness and coordination  is rolling from a medium bank to the left into a medium bank  to the right, then back to the left and continuing the series  while maintaining a constant base heading and altitude. Each  of these exercises helps develop smoothness, coordination,  and an active scan pattern.  

If a student is having trouble coordinating rpm and manifold  pressure, an exercise in throttle/collective coordination can  be used. Have the student maintain a constant attitude while  disregarding altitude. Now, instruct the student to change  the manifold pressure with the collective while holding a  constant rpm with the throttle. Then, reverse the procedure  by having the student change the rpm with the throttle while  maintaining a constant manifold pressure with the collective.  This exercise allows the student to concentrate on throttle/ collective coordination without devoting attention to other  factors.  

# Approaches  

An approach is defined as the transition from traffic pattern  altitude to either a hover or to the surface. In day-to-day  operations, approaches in a helicopter may be dictated more  by existing conditions than by formal patterns. For training,  however, a formal pattern is used to give the student a basis  upon which to build the modified patterns a particular situation  may require. Downwind, base, and final approach legs should  be flown in accordance with the patterns the instructor  outlines. A normal approach uses a descent profile of  $8^{\circ}–12^{\circ}$    starting at approximately 300 feet AGL.  [Figure 10-3]  The  rectangular pattern explained on page 10-20 serves as a good  basis for helicopter traffic pattern with the downwind at 500  feet AGL or higher as needed for noise, traffic and aircraft  characteristics.  

![](images/4c117aacd874e716292ec042f0808fc14298cf31ec4e9bb70aa07a192ab9f91a.jpg)  
Figure 10-3.   Plan the final so the helicopter rolls out on an  imaginary extension of the centerline for the final approach path.  This path should neither angle to the landing area, as shown by  the helicopter on the left, nor require an S-turn, as shown by the  helicopter on the right.  

Emphasize to the student that aligning with the landing  direction may allow the pilot to detect winds sooner and detect  obstructions. Flying any path that is less than straight into an  area on the approach azimuth decreases the time available for  hazard detection and low reconnaissance.  

# Instructional Points  

For the beginning student, each approach should be started  at approximately the same position and at the same airspeed  and altitude. This allows a consistent basis for the student  and instructor to evaluate each approach. To accomplish this,  concentrate on each leg of the traffic pattern so the helicopter  arrives at the point the approach is started and at the correct  position, speed, and altitude.  

As the approach angle comes into view, begin the approach  by lowering the collective sufficiently to get the helicopter  descending down the approach angle. The approach angle  should be an imaginary angle from the landing gear to the  landing point, and not from the pilot’s eyes to the landing  point. With the decrease in the collective, the nose tends to  pitch down, requiring aft cyclic to maintain the recommended  approach airspeed attitude. Adjust antitorque pedal as  necessary to maintain yaw trim.  

Maintain entry airspeed until the apparent groundspeed and  rate of closure appear to be increasing. At this point, slowly  began decelerating with slight aft cyclic, and smoothly lower  the collective to maintain approach angle. Use the cyclic to  maintain an apparent rate of closure equivalent to a brisk walk.  

Explain to the student that a helicopter pilot should plan an  approach to keep the skids/landing gear at a constant angle  to a 3-foot hover over the intended landing area. Keeping the  landing area in one spot in the windshield or “bubble” does  not result in a good approach for a helicopter pilot. It is best  for the pilot to visualize and fly the skids/landing gear down  the approach angle to the hover point.  

At approximately 25–40 feet AGL, depending on wind,  the helicopter begins to lose effective translational lift. To  compensate for this loss, increase the collective to maintain  the approach angle, while maintaining the proper rpm. The  increase of collective pitch tends to make the nose rise,  requiring forward cyclic to maintain the proper rate of  closure. On short final, this is also when the airflow in the  aft portion of the rotor disk is disturbed, so the increased  pitch in the forward portion of the disk is not balanced by  the same lift in the aft portion. Depending on the amount of  deceleration used, forward cyclic may be needed to maintain  the hovering position.  

As the helicopter approaches the recommended hover altitude,  increase the collective sufficiently to maintain the hover. At  the same time, apply aft cyclic to stop any forward movement,  while controlling the heading with antitorque pedals.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

# Ground Track  

There can be no basis upon which to build unless the approach  path is consistent. Therefore, the student must start the pattern  from the same indicated airspeed, altitude, and distance  from the landing spot. Thereafter, the student should be  encouraged to maintain the correct pattern so each approach  does not present a new set of circumstances. During initial  training, explain to the student how different wind conditions  can affect the helicopter and teach them how to adjust the  flight controls so that they are always flying the helicopter  rather than letting the helicopter take control of them. As  the student gains experience, the instructor should have the  student brief the effects of the winds on the expected flight  maneuvers and what actions must be taken by the student to  counteract those effects.  

# Altitude  

The same comments concerning ground track are applicable  to altitudes on downwind, base, and the turn to final  approach. Changing altitude requires modifications in some  other parameter, resulting in a different approach pattern.  Therefore, turns to each leg of the approach should be made  from the same spot and at the same altitude during a single  training period.  

# Airspeed  

Airspeed control is important if the student is to establish  and maintain a consistent approach. Thus, it is important  for the student to be aware of, and adhere to, recommended  approach airspeeds.  

# Approach Angle  

The student must understand the reason for utilizing a  standard approach path. It is to establish the final approach  leg at a distance and altitude that requires the same angle to  the landing spot on each approach. In this manner, the student  learns to visualize the correct approach angle, making it easier  to learn the techniques for making corrections.  

If there is a visual approach slope indicator (VASI) of some  type near, it is good to have the student look up the VASI’s  glide slope angle and then fly to the VASI. It is often helpful  for the instructor to fly while the student observes how the  stated angle appears. Because VASI’s are often near   $3^{\circ}$  ,  about three times that angel   $(9^{\circ})$   can be a normal helicopter  approach angle. The instructor will then announce when the  VASI angle is doubled and finally begin the descent when  triple the VASI angle. This allows the student to have a gauge  or standard for the normal approach angle.  

# Traffic  

With all the other factors requiring the student’s attention,  it is very easy to relax vigilance for other aircraft. Before  turning to base leg, the student should be required to check  for approaching traffic and state whether the pattern is clear  of conflicting traffic. Then on final approach, the area should  be checked in all directions to make sure there are no other  aircraft on, or about to turn onto, the final approach leg.  

# Power Adjustments  

During the approach, the power setting is usually quite low.  In a hover, it is quite high. Most beginning students wait until  they are very close to the ground before adding power. This  can easily lead to overcontrolling. This is usually done while  transitioning through translational lift. The instructor should  remind the student that, as power is added by increasing the  collective, the cyclic must be used to ensure the extra power  is all directed to replace the lift lost as translational lift is lost.  This is done by adjusting the cyclic aft in most conditions.  As this is happening, the student will also correct for yaw  from the loss of translational thrust and place the helicopter  in a slip to align the landing gear with the ground track. This  habit is important when a landing to the surface begins.  

When power is added, the attitude must be changed to  continue moving forward and down to the intended landing  spot. Forward cycle may be needed because too much  deceleration will excessively slow the rate of closure. While  paying attention to airspeed and the height/velocity diagram,  it may be necessary to slow the helicopter more than usual in  the beginning phases of training so the student understands,  and is comfortable with, the transition from the approach to  the hover.  

# Go-Around  

Before solo, a student must be taught the procedures and  techniques used in a go-around. Encourage the student to use  the go-around procedure as a safety precaution at any time  he or she is uncomfortable with continuing the approach.  Go-arounds should be taught early and often. Every student  should know that go-arounds are good maneuvers for the  best pilots. If in doubt, go-around! Students should learn to  abort landings when the circumstances feel uncomfortable.  

# Instructional Points  

A go-around is initiated by adding power to the climb power  setting and accelerating to climb speed. When power is added,  two common errors may occur:  

1.	 With the initial power change, the rate of descent may  stop, and the student may not add enough power to  continue a climb (they level off).  

2.	 When power is added, the nose of the helicopter  begins to rise, giving the impression that the helicopter  is climbing. This results in a loss of airspeed if no  forward cyclic is added. If allowed to continue, the  helicopter may begin to settle.  

When the decision to initiate a go-around is made, carry it  out without hesitation.  

# Common Student Difficulties Initiating the Go-Around  

Even experienced pilots may be hesitant to initiate a go-around,  either from failure to recognize the need for one or as a matter  of pride. Teach the student to recognize the need for a go- around early in the approach instead of waiting until the last  moment. The safety of the aircraft and its occupants is the first  consideration, and a go-around should be executed at the first  indication of an unsatisfactory approach or any unsafe conditions  on the intended landing point. Also discuss with the student the  difference in helicopter reactions (power requirements) while  performing go-arounds above and below ETL.  

# Coordination  

Many things must be accomplished simultaneously as a go- around is initiated. Collective is increased, rpm is adjusted  as necessary, antitorque pedal corrections are made, and the  attitude is adjusted to first accelerate to climb speed and then  to maintain it. In the process, the student might overlook one  or more of the required adjustments. It may help to practice  the first few go-arounds at higher altitudes so the proximity  to the ground is not a distracting factor.  

# Normal and Crosswind Takeoff From a  Hover  

The normal takeoff from a hover is the transition from  hovering flight into a climb over a specified ground track.  During the climb, airspeed and altitude should be such that the  crosshatched or shaded areas of the height/velocity diagram  are avoided. Other types of takeoff may be performed;  however, the student needs to learn early how and why he  or she is performing a specific takeoff. The pilot should be  making a risk assessment to determine which type of takeoff  is the safest.  

# Instructional Points  

Discuss with the student during the preflight, what control  inputs are required during hovering flight and takeoffs. There  is more to a normal takeoff than just adding forward cyclic.  Bring the helicopter to a hover and make a performance  check, which includes power, balance, and flight controls.  The power check should include an evaluation of the  amount of excess power available. The balance condition  of the helicopter is indicated by the position of the cyclic  when maintaining a stationary hover. Wind may necessitate  some cyclic deflection, but there should not be an extreme  deviation from neutral. Flight controls must move freely, and  a helicopter should respond normally.  

Visually clear the area all around and above. Start the  helicopter moving by smoothly and slowly easing the cyclic  forward. As the helicopter starts to move forward, increase  the collective as necessary to prevent the helicopter from  sinking and adjust the throttle to maintain rpm. The sink is  caused by diverting lift into forward thrust. Discuss with the  student the aerodynamic effects of the rotor system during  hovering flight and during normal takeoff. The increase in  power requires an increase in the proper antitorque pedal to  maintain heading. Emphasis should be placed on aligning  landing gear precisely with the direction of travel to avoid  dynamic rollover should the student allow the helicopter to  touch the surface during takeoff.  

Select ground reference points to maintain a straight takeoff  path throughout the takeoff. Ensure the student chooses  several ground reference points during the maneuver to  maintain a ground track. As the forward portion of the  rotor system gains undisturbed air, the lift on the forward  portion of the rotor tends to lift the front of the disk and  stops the acceleration. A little forward cyclic to maintain  the accelerating attitude is necessary to continue the takeoff.  

As the aft portion of the rotor system gains undisturbed air,  the nose tends to tilt forward, causing an excessively fast  acceleration. At about the same time, translational lift becomes  apparent and some forward cyclic motion is required to gain  sufficient airspeed to avoid the H/V chart shaded areas, while  continuing a safe climb avoiding the shaded areas.  

As airspeed increases, the streamlining of the fuselage  reduces engine torque effect, requiring a gradual reduction  of antitorque pedal pressure. Just as translational lift occurs,  translational thrust follows. This gives two effects that must  be countered by adjusting the pedals as the climb begins. As  the helicopter continues to climb and accelerate to best rate  of climb, apply aft cyclic pressure to raise the nose smoothly  to the normal attitude.  

Ensure that the student understands that he or she must make  constant corrections during all phases of flight (this is to  compensate for actions and reactions).  

# Crosswind Considerations During Takeoffs  

When the takeoff is made during crosswind conditions,  the helicopter is flown in a slip during early stages of the  maneuver. In this case, the cyclic is held into the wind a  sufficient amount to maintain the desired ground track for  the takeoff. The heading is maintained with the use of the  antitorque pedals. In other words, the rotor is tilted into  the wind so the sideward movement of the helicopter is  just enough to counteract the crosswind effect. To prevent  the nose from turning in the direction of the rotor tilt, it is  necessary to increase the antitorque pedal pressure on the  side opposite the rotor tilt.  

After approximately 50 feet of altitude is gained, crab the  helicopter into the wind as necessary to maintain coordinated  flight over the desired ground track. The stronger the  crosswind, the more the helicopter has to be turned into the  wind.  

# Common Student Difficulties Attitude Control  

As in most other maneuvers, smooth, positive attitude control  is the key to success in the takeoff. If the student is properly  briefed and understands the changing forces during takeoff,  it is possible to anticipate and correct deviations promptly.  

At about five knots, ground effect diminishes and a helicopter  begins to sink. Depending on available power and instructor  technique, power should be added to prevent this sink. Any  power change requires an antitorque pedal adjustment,  which in turn requires a cyclic adjustment to accommodate  the increased translating tendency. If the student does not  make these adjustments, the ground track will not be straight.  Shortly after forward movement is initiated, translational lift  is encountered and the nose pitches. This requires forward  cyclic to keep the helicopter accelerating.  

# Heading Control  

Pedal control requirements also change during the transition  into a climb. From the hover, additional power is added in  helicopters with counterclockwise main rotor blade rotation,  the left pedal requirement increases. As speed increases,  directional stability increases, so the need for left pedal  decreases. The tail rotor achieves translational thrust due to  clean airflow and begins making more antitorque thrust than is  required, especially if the helicopter has an effective vertical fin  that also helps with the antitorque task. These actions require  a decrease in antitorque pedal to maintain heading. A throttle  change may be necessary since the power demand from the  tail rotor decreases. A governor hides this control change.  

# Crosswind Corrections  

If the takeoff is made in a crosswind condition, the student  may not be aware of the corrections required during the climb  unless briefed in advance. In the hover and during the initial  portion of the climb, cyclic must be applied toward the wind,  and downwind, pedal applied to keep the helicopter heading  straight along the ground track. As speed and altitude are  gained, the cyclic is used to establish a crab. As the helicopter  is placed into a crab, the antitorque pedal pressure must be  decreased from the slip into coordinated or “trimmed” flight.  Failure to correct for the crosswind results in a downwind  drift from the specified ground track. After the helicopter has  transitioned through effective translational lift (ETL), the  student should begin to crab the helicopter (trim), improving  the climb performance. Once the desired or required climb  airspeed is attained, the cyclic should be adjusted to maintain  the stabilized airspeed attitude. Recommend using slip to  align the fuselage with the ground track below approximately  50 feet, and trim the helicopter above 50 feet.  

# Traffic  

The student may concentrate so completely on achieving the  stated objectives that conflicting traffic and obstructions, such  as towers and powerlines, go unnoticed. Instructing students  to look well ahead of the helicopter and to scan for traffic  not only helps their awareness of other traffic, but also helps  improve attitude control.  

# Hovering  

Learning to hover can be a frustrating experience for some  students as it may take a few flights to learn the maneuver.  Instructors should emphasize that the student should relax.  Hovering is very difficult at first, but it does work and its  importance cannot be overemphasized.  

# Vertical Takeoff to a Hover and Hovering  

Prior to ascending to a hover, teach the student to always  check for unreleased tiedowns or restrictions to the freedom  of the landing gear. Pilots should always take off to a hover  slowly to avoid dynamic rollover accidents from hung  landing gear. A slow takeoff also gives the pilot more time  to adjust for the translating tendency, making the takeoff  smoother and more controlled.  

Explain to the student that a vertical takeoff to a hover  involves flying the helicopter from the ground vertically to  a landing gear height of two to four feet, while maintaining  a constant heading. Demonstrate various hovering heights  and allow the student to see how a hover at each height  appears.  [Figure 10-4]  Once the desired landing gear height  is achieved, the helicopter should remain nearly motionless  over a reference point at a constant altitude and on a  constant heading. The maneuver requires a high degree of  concentration and coordination.

Prior to any takeoff or maneuver, have the student ensure  the area is clear of other traffic, persons, equipment or  obstacles. This can be accomplished by instilling the habit  of clearing the helicopter to the left, right, and overhead prior  to performing any maneuver.  

One additional instructional point to make is to teach the  student to assess the helicopter control response prior to each  flight. Have the student get the helicopter light on the skids/ gear and ensure the helicopter ascends to a hover in a nearly  level attitude. Ensure that you have enough cyclic control to  continue. Once at a three-foot hover, ensure the helicopter  remains nearly level. Point out to the student what a normal  hover attitude looks like. If things do not feel or look right,  slowly lower the collective and land the helicopter. Attempt

to determine why the helicopter is responding in such a way.  Adjustment or reduction of load may be necessary.  

To begin the maneuver, head the helicopter into the wind,  if possible. Place the cyclic in the neutral position with the  collective in the full down position. Increase the throttle  smoothly to obtain and maintain proper revolutions per  minute (rpm), then slowly raise the collective. Emphasize a  smooth, continuous movement, coordinating the throttle to  maintain proper rpm.  

As the collective is increased, the helicopter becomes light  on the landing gear, and torque tends to cause the nose to  swing or yaw to the right unless sufficient left antitorque  pedal is used to maintain heading. (On helicopters with a  clockwise main rotor system, the yaw is to the left and right  pedal must be applied.)  

As the helicopter becomes light on the landing gear, cyclic  pitch control adjustments are necessary to maintain a  level attitude. Unless the helicopter design compensates,  translating tendency requires constant left cyclic in  helicopters with counterclockwise rotating main rotor blades.  Many helicopters are designed to hover in a left-landing-gear- low attitude to correct for right drift.  

NOTE: When the term “level attitude” is used during hovering  flight, it is in reference to the helicopter remaining stationary  without excessive tilt of the fuselage. Each helicopter tends  to hover at some attitude that may not be exactly level or  parallel with the surface. Translating tendency, winds, and  weight and balance all contribute to the fuselage hanging at  some off angle to the surface. When the tailrotor is under the  plane of the main rotor disk, the fuselage is titled to stop the  travel induced by the lateral tail rotor thrust counteracting  the rotor torque.  

When the manufacturer designs the helicopter with an  elevated tailrotor, which places the antitorque in the same  plane as the main rotor torque, the fuselage tilt is much less  in calm wind conditions. If enough wind is blowing from the  opposite direction, the helicopter deck or cabin floor may  be level or parallel to the surface, as the cross wind pushes  on the side of the fuselage. However, if the wind is blowing  from the other side, the deck tilt angle is increased because  the rotor must develop sufficient thrust to counteract the tail  rotor thrust and the crosswind to maintain position over the  surface.  

If the helicopter only has a single, lightweight pilot aboard,  the fore and aft deck or cabin floor angle is probably pitched  nose-up compared to having two heavy pilots up front with  no other loading. Depending on the helicopter, unloading one  person can result in a 12 percent change in gross weight and  a corresponding change in pitch. Helicopters usually hover  in a normal attitude for that helicopter in that wind condition  under that load condition. The student should be taught what  the normal attitude for hovering is for the particular helicopter  that they are flying.  

When airborne, at a hover, antitorque pedals are used to  maintain heading and directional control while application  of collective ensures continuous vertical ascent to the normal  hovering altitude. When hovering altitude is reached, use  the throttle and collective to control altitude, the cyclic to  maintain a stationary hover, and the antitorque pedals to  maintain heading.  

Initially, the student will probably overcontrol the helicopter.  Excessive movement of any flight control requires a change  in the other flight controls. For example, if the helicopter  drifts to one side while hovering, a student naturally moves  the cyclic in the opposite direction. When this is done, part  of the vertical thrust is diverted, resulting in a loss of altitude.  To maintain altitude, the student must increase the collective.  This increases drag on the blades and tends to slow them.  To counteract the drag and maintain rpm, the throttle needs  to be increased. Because torque increases, the student must  add more pedal pressure to maintain the heading. This can  easily lead to overcontrolling the helicopter. However, as the  student’s level of proficiency increases, problems associated  with overcontrolling decrease.  

To maintain a hover over a point, have the student look  for minute changes in the helicopter’s attitude and altitude  by checking the rotor disk changes against the horizon.  When these changes are noticed, the student should make  the necessary control inputs before the helicopter starts to  move from the point. To detect small variations in altitude or  position, the student’s main area of visual attention needs to  be some distance from the aircraft, using various points on  the helicopter or the tip-path plane as a reference. Looking too  close or looking down leads to overcontrolling. Obviously,  in order to remain over a certain point, the student should  know where the point is, but his or her attention should not  be focused there.  

Note: Helicopter pilots tend to use their peripheral vision  more than most pilots. At some distance out in front of the  helicopter, the horizon is used for attitude control. Peripheral  vision is mainly used close in, near the helicopter, enabling  the helicopter pilot to discern the clues of movement from  a point (stationary reference). At some point during pilot  training, many pilots learn to view the horizon with their  peripheral vision and view the landing area with their  center vision. Inexperienced students that attempt this at the  beginning of their training tend to concentrate only on their  intended landing area (tunnel vision). They pay little or no  attention to the clues of movement close to the helicopter or  their attitude on the horizon. This can lead to loss of control.  

After a student gains experience, he or she develops a certain  “feel” for the helicopter. The student feels and sees small  deviations, so corrections can be made before the helicopter  actually moves. A certain relaxed looseness develops, and  controlling the helicopter becomes second nature, rather than  a mechanical response.  [Figure 10-5]  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Failure To Position Controls Properly  

The beginning student rarely knows how to position the  controls so the helicopter lifts off the ground in a level attitude  with no tendency to turn. Have the student check the tip- path plane of the rotor before raising the collective, looking  forward and to each side to see that it is level.  

# Visualizing Attitude  

The problems of visualizing attitude in the early stages of  training can be compounded in hovering flight by looking  at a point that is too close to the helicopter. This is a natural  tendency when trying to stay over a spot. The student should  pick a point well in front of the helicopter, so the horizon  is within normal peripheral vision. This makes it easier to  perceive the helicopter’s attitude while keeping the exact  position in view.  

# Overcontrolling  

The natural tendency to overcontrol is accentuated by the  responsiveness of the helicopter and the student’s eagerness  to get back over the takeoff spot immediately. While the  ultimate objective in hovering is to stay exactly over a spot,  the problem of overcontrolling can be alleviated by simply  having the student stay within a general area, with the stated  objective of gently stopping any drift that develops.  

Note: Remind the student of Newton’s first law of motion. An  object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in  the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.  

This is often referred to as “the law of inertia.” The student  can get ahead of the helicopter and make control inputs  before the helicopter has had time to completely respond  to any inputs. This is the normal progression of the student  gaining experience and getting the “feel” of the helicopter.  

# RPM Control  

In the initial attempts at hovering, the student usually does not  check rpm and make the necessary corrections. On helicopters  equipped with a governor or correlator, rpm control is  considerably easier. Periodically call attention to the rpm,  and point out that changes in engine rpm can also be heard.  

Coordination  

It is not uncommon for a student, particularly a student  transitioning from airplanes, to attempt to gain altitude by  applying rearward cyclic pressure, or attempt to turn by using  lateral cyclic. To correct this tendency, many instructors  operate one or two of the controls while allowing the student  to concentrate on the reaction produced by the remaining  control. For example, the instructor can operate the pedals and  collective while the student experiments with the reactions  produced by cyclic inputs.  

# Tension  

Tension is the natural result of a student’s efforts to perform  satisfactorily. The initial stage of training requires a great  deal of patience on the part of the instructor and a lot of  positive reinforcement and encouragement for the student.  When tension builds to a point where the student is incapable  of performing with an acceptable degree of proficiency, the  instructor should take over and allow the student to relax  for several moments. Usually, it is best to land and talk over  the problems and to ensure neither the student nor instructor  compares the student’s performance with the instructor’s  performance. After encouragement and constructive  criticism, another takeoff can be performed.  

# Hovering Height  

Many beginning students have a tendency to hover too high  or too low. Hovering too high can create a hazardous flight  condition, while hovering too low creates a risk of touching  the ground with lateral movement and possible dynamic  

![](images/04bbcae9cadb17cce89b80c3b2c5e67b47a9d77aa9e9b77960b4c8db38c05b88.jpg)

rollover. Abrupt aft cyclic movement can also lead to the  tail guard/stinger striking the ground and, in worse cases, the  tail rotor. To help avoid this problem, continually reinforce  what the correct height should look like and continuously  remind the student that a good scan helps prevent unwanted  altitude changes.  

# Hovering Turn  

Demonstrate how a hovering turn is accomplished by  manipulating the antitorque pedals while the helicopter  remains over a designated spot at a constant altitude.  [Figure 10-6]  The turn should be made at a low, constant  rate through varying degrees of heading.  

# Instructional Points  

A hovering turn is initiated in either direction by applying  antitorque pedal pressure toward the desired direction. Explain  that during a turn to the left more power is needed because  application of left pedal increases the pitch angle of the tail  rotor which, in turn, requires additional power from the  engine. A turn to the right requires less power. (On helicopters  with a clockwise rotating main rotor, right pedal increases the  pitch angle and, therefore, requires more power.)  

As the turn begins, use the cyclic as necessary (usually  into the wind) to keep the helicopter over the desired spot.  [Figure 10-7]  To continue the turn, additional pedal pressure  is required as the helicopter turns to the crosswind position.  

This is because the wind is striking the tail surface and the  tail rotor area, making it more difficult for the tail to turn  into the wind. As pedal pressures increase due to crosswind  forces, additional cyclic pressure into the wind is required  to maintain position. Use the collective with the throttle to  maintain a constant altitude and rpm.  

After the   $90^{\circ}$   portion of turn, pedal pressure is decreased  slightly to maintain the same rate of turn. Approaching  the   $180^{\circ}$   (downwind) portion, opposite pedal pressure  must be anticipated due to tail movement from an upwind  position to a downwind position. At this point, the rate of  turn has a tendency to increase at a rapid rate due to the  weathervaning tendencies of the tail surfaces. Because of the  tailwind condition, hold rearward cyclic pressure to keep the  helicopter over the same spot.  

Note: The horizontal stabilizer can increase the difficulty of  hovering with a strong tailwind. Depending on the specific  design and mounting of the stabilizer, a tailwind may tend to  lift the tail, requiring more aft cyclic, or lower the tail boom,  decreasing the amount of cyclic needed into the wind to hold  your position. The student needs to understand the stabilizer’s  response to tailwind conditions so as to anticipate control  movements required.  

Because of the helicopter’s tendency to weathervane,  maintaining the same rate of turn from the   $180^{\circ}$   position  

![](images/939db1f4559539c54e19916685363448eec0569890d57b38b9042080463ad223.jpg)

actually requires some pedal pressure opposite the direction  of turn. If opposite pedal pressure is not applied, the helicopter  tends to turn at a faster rate. The amount of pedal pressure  and cyclic deflection throughout the turn depends on the wind  velocity. As the turn finishes on the upwind heading, apply  opposite pedal pressure to stop the turn. Gradually apply  forward cyclic pressure to keep the helicopter from drifting.  

Control pressures and direction of application change  continuously throughout the turn. The most dramatic change  is the pedal pressure (and corresponding power requirement)  necessary to control the rate of turn as the helicopter moves  through the downwind portion of the maneuver.  

The instructor can have the student make turns in either  directions; however, in a high wind condition the tail rotor  may not be able to produce enough thrust, which means the  student will not be able to control a turn to the right in a  counterclockwise rotor system. Therefore, if control is ever  questionable, have the student first attempt to make a 90  degree turn to the left. If there is sufficient tail rotor thrust to  turn the helicopter crosswind in a left turn, a right turn can be  successfully controlled. The opposite applies to helicopters  with clockwise rotor systems. Hovering turns should be  avoided in winds strong enough to preclude sufficient aft  cyclic control to maintain the helicopter on the selected  surface reference point when headed downwind.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

In addition to the difficulties already discussed in the  Takeoff  to a Hover  section, there are some difficulties associated  specifically with the hovering turn.  

Improper Rate of Turn  

Until the student has gained some experience in hovering  turns, the amount of pedal required for the desired rate of  turn is not known. The result is a turn that is either too slow  or too fast, often varying rapidly between the two. The first  hovering turns should be practiced in calm or light winds, so  a certain pedal input results in a specific rate of turn.  

# Compensating for Crosswind  

Students usually fail to anticipate the effect of the wind  as the helicopter turns. The student must understand that,  throughout the turn, the cyclic is displaced into the wind,  and is independent of the direction of the turn. Also, pedal  input must be increased as the turn approaches the crosswind  position, then decreased as the downwind position is  approached. Passing the downwind position, the student  should anticipate an increase in the rate of turn as a result  of the wind force.  

# Coordination  

Before attempting hovering turns, the instructor should  explain and demonstrate the effects of pedal input. For  example, explain how a left pedal input causes a right drifting  tendency, which must be compensated for by using left side  cyclic. Even more noticeable is the effect on engine rpm. Left  pedal input causes a decrease in rpm and right pedal input  causes an increase. As the student gains an understanding  of these effects, the tendency to overcontrol the antitorque  pedals should diminish.  

# Hovering Forward  

Forward hovering should be accomplished at hovering  altitude and at a speed no faster than a brisk walk with heading  remaining constant. The forward track should be defined by  markings on the ground or by the alignment of two reference  points.  [Figure 10-8]  

![](images/c24dfd6ca84e2549ca08d5c496be5211193a00a1263e6c719fe38f780c0a0a43.jpg)  
Figure 10-8.   To maintain a straight ground track, use two reference  points in line and at some distance in front of the helicopter.  

# Instructional Points  

Instruct students on the importance of maintaining a landing  gear height high enough to allow adequate ground clearance  before hovering in any direction. Stress to the student that  the risk of dynamic rollover is greatest during any hovering  maneuver. This also stresses the importance of keeping the  landing gear aligned with the direction of travel.  

Apply forward cyclic to start the forward motion, then  release some cyclic pressure to prevent the helicopter from  accelerating. Hold enough forward cyclic pressure to keep  forward motion no faster than a brisk walk. Any speed higher  than this requires a higher landing gear height to allow  adequate ground clearance for the tail landing gear when  bringing a helicopter to a stop using rearward cyclic. As the  helicopter begins to move forward and lift is diverted, add a  little power to compensate for the loss of lift.  

Throughout the maneuver, maintain a constant ground speed  and path over the ground with the cyclic, a constant heading  with the antitorque pedals, altitude with the collective, and  the proper rpm with the throttle.  

To stop the forward movement, apply rearward cyclic pressure  so that the helicopter glides to a halt at a hover, taking care  not to lower the tail rotor into the ground. As forward motion  stops, return the cyclic to the neutral position to prevent  rearward movement. Forward movement can also be stopped  by simply applying rearward pressure to level the helicopter  and let it drift to a stop.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Altitude Control  

The student may not understand that an airspeed of about 5  knots requires the most power to maintain altitude as ground  effect diminishes and translational lift has not begun to help.  As the helicopter begins to move forward in a calm wind, it  also tends to sink. The student may think this is caused by too  much forward cyclic, and the resulting correction causes a  helicopter to stop. Point out that a slight amount of increased  collective is required as forward motion starts. This usually  alleviates the problem.  

Note: Moving forward requires forward thrust, whereas at a  stationary hover, only enough thrust is needed to overcome  the wind. Begin a forward hover by diverting some lift  to thrust, if that lift is not restored, the hovering altitude  decreases. The more lift diverted to thrust, the lower the  hover altitude, or the more collective must be increased,  with the power increase sufficient to maintain rpm with more  antitorque needed as well.  

Sideward Drift  

Drift to the side of the planned ground track can be the  result of concentration on trying to maintain the heading and  altitude. If the ground track is being maintained by reference  to a line on the ground, the student may be looking too close  to the helicopter and may not notice changes in the altitude.  If the student has trouble maintaining the specified ground  track, refocus attention to reference points that are farther  away from the helicopter.  

# Hovering Sideward  

Sideward flight begins in a hover and is performed at a  constant heading, altitude, and airspeed.  

# Instructional Points  

Explain to the student that the risk of dynamic rollover is  highest during sideward hovering maneuvers. Maintain  adequate landing gear height. Also ensure that sufficient  clearance exists for the expected and possible path of the tail  rotor for sideward hovering.  

Before starting sideward flight, make sure the student clears  the area. This may require some clearing turns. Then have the  student pick two points of reference in a line in the direction  of sideward flight to help maintain the proper ground track.  These reference points should be kept in line throughout the  maneuver.  [Figure 10-9]  

![](images/b41e6189cad17cf1b09e31e104373402845d6c2c3096841edc048ada41c16fe1.jpg)  
Figure 10-9.   The key to hovering sideward is establishing at least  two reference points that help maintain a straight track over the  ground while keeping a constant heading.  

The maneuver is begun at a normal hovering altitude by  applying cyclic toward the side in which the movement is  desired. As the movement begins, return the cyclic toward the  neutral position to keep the groundspeed low. Throughout the  maneuver, maintain a constant groundspeed and ground track  with cyclic. Maintain heading, perpendicular to the ground  track in this maneuver, with the antitorque pedals, and a  constant altitude with collective. Use the throttle to maintain  the proper operating rpm. As with all maneuvers, instructors  should emphasize the importance of scanning. Viewing  objects or obstacles while flying sideways can be deceptive.  From a distance, trees and wires may look smaller or higher  than they actually are. Terrain may look flat until you hover  closer to it and quickly realize that it slopes up and you could  possibly contact it with either the landing gear or tail rotor.  

To stop the sideward movement, apply cyclic pressure in  the direction opposite to that of movement and hold it until  the helicopter stops. As motion stops, return the cyclic to  the neutral position to prevent movement in the opposite  direction. Applying sufficient opposite cyclic pressure to  level the helicopter may also stop sideward movement. The  helicopter then drifts to a stop.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

# Speed Control  

In sideward flight, lateral cyclic input controls speed. If  the student is looking primarily to the side in an attempt to  maintain the track, roll attitude can be difficult to maintain.  Scan must be continuous if the correct attitude is to be  maintained. The student must continuously check to the side,  then look in front to check attitude. This is followed by a  check of the rpm, then a look back to the side.  

# Drift  

Drift can also be an attitude problem. If the student  concentrates too much to the side, pitch attitude can deviate  from level, resulting in drift from the desired track.  

# Heading  

As the helicopter begins to move sideward, the nose tends to  weathercock into the direction of flight. Again, this may not  be noticed if the student is concentrating his or her attention  in the direction of flight.  

# Hovering Rearward  

Rearward hovering is conducted using reference points ahead  of the helicopter to maintain track. Altitude and heading  should remain constant, and groundspeed should be no faster  than a brisk walk.  

# Instructional Points  

Before beginning the maneuver, make sure the area behind  the helicopter is clear. This is accomplished by making a  $90^{\circ}$  clearing turn. Choose two reference points in front of, and in  line with, the helicopter as if hovering forward. The movement  of the helicopter should be such that these points remain in line.  

Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering altitude by  applying rearward pressure on the cyclic. Once the movement  has begun, position the cyclic to maintain a low groundspeed  (no faster than a brisk walk). Throughout the maneuver,  maintain constant groundspeed and ground track with the  cyclic, a constant heading with the antitorque petals, constant  altitude with the collective, and the proper rpm with the throttle.  

When hovering backwards, the helicopter is tilted so the tail  is low to the ground. Therefore, maintain a slightly higher  than normal hovering altitude.  

To stop the rearward movement, apply forward cyclic and  hold it until the helicopter stops. As the motion stops, return  the cyclic to the neutral position. Also, as in the case of  forward flight and sideward flight, use opposite cyclic to  level the helicopter and let it drift to a stop.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Speed Control  

The student may not realize that it takes a steeper pitch  attitude to start the helicopter moving than it does to  continue motion at a steady speed. If the nose is not moved  down slightly as the desired rearward speed is attained, the  helicopter continues to accelerate.  

Note: Acceleration and force are vectors. In Newton’s second  law of motion, the direction of the force vector is the same  as the direction of the acceleration vector. In other words, an  object with a certain velocity maintains that velocity unless a  force acts on it to cause an acceleration (that is, a change in  the velocity). If the pitch attitude is not returned to a neutral  (non-accelerating or decelerating) attitude, stabilization of  the speed and velocity cannot occur.  

# Heading  

The faster the helicopter travels rearward, the greater the  tendency for the nose of the helicopter to swing around toward  the direction of flight. With the tail directly into the relative  wind, there is little tendency for it to weathervane, but if the  relative wind is a little bit on one side, the tail tends to continue  to the downwind side. The resulting heading correction  requires a fairly large pedal input, which may cause an  overshoot to the other side, and the process must be repeated  with opposite pedal input. Speed must be reduced to regain  control. During preflight, show the student which surface areas  of the helicopter are affected by relative wind from different  directions (what is causing the weathervane). Discuss how  you need to overcome the effects of the wind during different  directions of hover (forward, rearward, sideward).  

# Landing From a Hover  

The helicopter is stabilized in a hover directly over the  intended landing spot, then gently lowered onto the ground.  It should not drift in any direction at the point of touchdown.  The instructor should remind the student pilot of the flight  control changes that must occur during this seemingly simple  task. As the helicopter begins to settle onto the surface, all of  the flight controls must be manipulated simultaneously and  in coordination to achieve a smooth landing.  

When choosing a landing area for the student to practice  landing from a hover, instructors should keep in mind that  certain conditions usually dictate a landing directly to the  ground with little or no hover. For example, dust, sand, or  snow landings are very difficult and should not be attempted  until the student has shown considerable proficiency with  takeoffs and landings. These types of landings are discussed  in Chapter 12, Helicopter Emergencies. Landing in a grassy  field or in a spot with puddles of water can also cause problems  for flight students. The grass or water motion presents a false  picture of helicopter movement to the new pilot and causes  them to incorrectly respond when attempting to land.  

# Instructional Points  

The student should be instructed to look outside and ahead  of the helicopter. Focusing on the ground through the chin  bubble leads to overcontrolling and makes it difficult to land  on the desired spot.  

Always keep the rpm within limits. This allows for quick  transition back to hover if the landing is not suitable. Never  allow the helicopter to settle on the ground, which might occur  if the throttle is reduced below the rpm limits. To prevent  overspeed, the correct technique requires simultaneously  lowering the collective and reducing the throttle.  

Do not abruptly lower the collective once ground contact  is made. First, ensure the ground is sufficiently stable to  support the helicopter. This requires a slow and deliberate  lowering of the collective. The cyclic may be moved in a  small circular motion to determine that the helicopter is firmly  on the ground before lowering the collective fully. Once the  helicopter is firmly on the ground, the collective should be  lowered completely.  

Landing a helicopter requires the same attention as takeoffs to  a hover. Point out which skid/gear will contact the surface first  and why. What control inputs will be applied to stop sliding  (moving forward)? Forward or aft cyclic may be required  during the landing to maintain the position. How is excessive  slope recognized before the tilt is too much to overcome?  

# Common Student Difficulties  

# Attitude Control  

The closer the helicopter comes to the ground, the more  likely it is for the student to focus on a point almost directly  beneath the helicopter. As the helicopter descends, ground  effect tends to increase, thereby creating a greater workload  for the pilot to maintain coordination of all the flight controls  until the helicopter is on the surface. Without proper attitude  technique, the student may overcontrol when the helicopter  begins to drift, and the situation may go from bad to worse.  The student must be taught to look far in front of the helicopter  and then gently lower it until the touchdown is felt, not seen.  Remind the student that most likely one side of the landing  gear contacts the surface before the other due to winds or  translating tendency. Due to loading and winds, the front or  the rear of the landing gear may touchdown first depending  on the hovering attitude of that helicopter. In any event, as the  landing gear first touches down, cyclic and pedal corrections  are continually necessary to maintain heading and position  until the remainder of the landing gear is firmly on the surface.  

# RPM Control  

During the landing, rotor rpm tends to increase due to the  effects of increased ground effect and decreased collective  pitch. During touchdown, for those helicopters not equipped  with a governor, the throttle may need to be reduced to avoid  an overspeed.  

# Taxi  

Once a student has learned the basic skills required to  hover the helicopter, those skills translate into the practical  application of taxiing the helicopter. In order to accomplish  this task the student should understand the terms used and the  limitations placed on each action and the basic information  and safety involved in selecting hover altitudes and speeds  derived from the H/V chart.  

# Hover Taxi  

The term hover taxi is used to describe a helicopter movement  conducted above the surface and in ground effect at airspeeds  less than approximately 20 knots.  [Figure 10-10]  The actual  height may vary, and some helicopters may hover taxi above  25 feet above ground level (AGL) to reduce ground effect  turbulence or provide clearance for cargo slingloads.  

![](images/7136e9fd5e4e5153dbe71502df65fd15793a6be2308490d8f3157bedfb04973d.jpg)  
Figure 10-10.   Hover taxi.  

# Air Taxi  

The term air taxi describes helicopter movement conducted  above the surface, but normally not above 100 feet AGL.  [Figure 10-11]  The helicopter may proceed either via hover  taxi or flight at speeds more than 20 knots. The pilot is solely  responsible for selecting a safe airspeed/altitude for the  operation being conducted.  

![](images/4a2df5692d6d149bb3c39349fe1a026b5b85ef7548017462d0eaba72e4014b25.jpg)  
Figure 10-11.   Air taxi.  

# Surface/Ground Taxi  

Taxi, surface taxi, or ground taxi is the movement of an  aircraft under its own power actually in physical contact  with the surface of an airport. It also describes the  surface movement of helicopters equipped with wheels.  [Figure 10-12]  

![](images/025b72efc8562abd081cad20ebe426e9c4d89b30b5d0ff6016d4c37fa6dfa1ac.jpg)  
Figure 10-12.   Surface taxi.  

Ground taxi can form the basis for a running takeoff used  by older, underpowered helicopters. Ground taxi creates less  downwash, since less thrust is required to slide the skids  than to support the entire weight of the helicopter. Wheeled  taxi is very efficient. Water or ski taxi is between those two  extremes in terms of power required.  

Surface taxi includes ground contact taxiing with wheels,  floats, skis, or skids. Ground contact requires less power than  hover taxiing and produces less rotor wash, depending on the  surface friction. If skis are stuck to the surface, it may take  some power to break them loose. Surface taxi also provides  an alternative method of taking off in white or brownout  conditions by blowing the obstructing material behind  the helicopter as some airspeed is reached and certainly  by translational lift speed. Caution should be observed to  prevent the landing gear from being stuck to the surface or  striking something on the takeoff surface, leading to dynamic  rollover. Surface taxi is not a common or preferred maneuver,  but it has been used in certain situations, generally in much  older, underpowered helicopters.  

# Instructional Points  

For hover taxi, air taxi, and taxi, have the student review the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), paragraphs 4-3-17  and 7-5-13c. Prior to air taxi demonstration and practice, the  instructor should review the H/V chart and have the student  assist in planning or developing a safe air taxi profile of  airspeeds versus altitudes. Since the AIM gives 100' AGL  as the upper limit, the instructor should find 100'AGL on the  chart and determine minimum and maximum airspeeds for  the maneuver, remembering the helicopter requires power to  decelerate and come to hover without translational lift and  thrust. Discuss with the student the H/V chart to determine  the safest flight profile that should be used during any taxi  operation.  

The advantages of ground or surface taxi for skid-equipped  helicopters should be discussed so the student will understand  some criteria for deciding on their own when ground taxi  is safer and the recommended maneuver for that occasion.  

Discuss with the student the H/V chart to determine the safest  flight profile that should be used during any taxi operation.  

# Ground Reference Maneuvers  

Ground reference maneuvers are training exercises that can  be used to develop coordination, division of attention, and  situational awareness. The maneuvers themselves are not  evaluated during the practical test, but the skills developed  by accomplishing them are evaluated during the conduct of  other tasks. By performing ground reference maneuvers,  a student develops a better understanding of the effects of  wind drift and how to compensate for winds from different  directions during flight.  

# Rectangular Course  

The rectangular course helps the student develop recognition  of drift toward or away from a line parallel to the intended  ground track.  [Figure 10-13]  It is important that he or she  understand the effects of the wind and how to compensate  for it. The rectangular course also simulates an airport traffic  pattern, as well as many of the maneuvers a helicopter  is tasked with performing, such as tracking an event for  photographic purposes, aerial surveys, and observation  duties. This is an opportunity to point out to the student  what each segment of a traffic pattern represents (upwind,  crosswind, downwind, base, and final leg).  

For this maneuver, pick a square or rectangular field, or  an area bounded on four sides by section lines or roads,  where the sides are approximately a mile in length. The  area selected should be well away from other air traffic. Fly  the maneuver between   $500^{\circ}$   and   $800^{\circ}$   feet AGL, which is  the altitude normally required for an airport traffic pattern  to avoid the flow of fixed wing traffic. If the student finds

Figure 10-13.   A rectangular course.  

it difficult to maintain a proper ground track at that higher  altitude, adjust the altitude for better ground reference until  the student feels more comfortable and is able to grasp the  concept better. The helicopter should be flown parallel to and  at a uniform distance from the field boundaries, not above  the boundaries. Demonstrate that by flying directly above  the edges of the field, there are no usable reference points to  start and complete the turns. In addition, the closer the track  of the helicopter is to the field boundaries, the steeper the  bank necessary at the turning points.  

The student should understand that when trying to fly a  straight line and maintain a specific heading, the helicopter  should always be kept in trim with the antitorque pedals and  the pilot should crab into the wind (with the cyclic) to stay  on the proper ground track. The concept of “crabbing” can  be difficult for the student to understand when first learning  how to fly a traffic pattern. The instructor should show the  student what happens when you try to fly a straight line with a  crosswind, and point out how far off course the wind can take  you. Keeping the helicopter in trim and keeping the helicopter  straight are done with two different flight controls, and the  instructor should ensure the student understands the effects  of crabbing to allow for wind drift. Since the helicopter is not  headed exactly parallel to the rectangle course, turns at the  corners of the rectangle may be more or less than 90 degrees  with a shallower or steeper bank angle to hold the correct  distance from the rectangle. The rectangular course requires  the student to adjust for winds from each quadrant. Also  ensure that the cyclic trim (if installed) is properly trimmed  in order to decrease the pressures on the pilot.  

Prior to takeoff, the instructor should discuss with the student  how the wind velocity aloft are greater than those reported on  the ground and may possibly shift. If the winds are known, the  instructor can have the student calculate the amount of wind  crab necessary to track the boundaries. This allows the student  more insight to the use of crab angles to track courses. Not  enough emphasis can be placed on always knowing which  way the winds are coming from and how to be vigilant in  seeking ground cues for hints of a wind change.  

# S-Turn  

The S-turn is another training maneuver that requires a student  to compensate for winds.  [Figure 10-14]  This maneuver  requires turns to the left and right. Choose a road, a fence,  or a railroad for a reference line. Regardless of what is used,  it should be straight for a considerable distance and should  extend as close to perpendicular to the wind as possible.  

An S-turn is a pattern of two half circles of equal size on  opposite sides of a reference line. A standard radius for  S-turns cannot be specified, since the radius depends on  the airspeed of the helicopter, the velocity of the wind, and  

![](images/63755089cf0efded09228a010c727b78a2475cd0233e2a33d3f2c11b8ad5581b.jpg)  
Figure 10-14.   S-turns across a road.  

the initial bank chosen for entry. The maneuver should be  performed at a constant altitude. While S-turns may be started  at any point, it may be beneficial during early training to  start the maneuver with the helicopter flying into the wind.  

# Turns Around a Point  

This training maneuver requires the student to fly constant- radius turns around a preselected point on the ground, using a  bank of approximately  $30^{\circ}$   while maintaining both a constant  altitude and the same distance from the point throughout the  maneuver.  [Figure 10-15]  The objective, as in other ground  reference maneuvers, is to develop the ability to control the  helicopter subconsciously while dividing attention between  the flightpath, how the winds are affecting the turn, and  ground references, while still watching for other air traffic  in the vicinity.  

![](images/0496f4248b6d24f0e86d4df489118b8b647e367e0fcf464a131297755b9f6e29.jpg)  
Figure 10-15.   Turns around a point.  

A reason to perform turns around a point, other than for  proficiency, is high reconnaissance, photography, survey, and  search and rescue. Great care should be exercised to remain  clear of obstructions and other low-level traffic during ground  reference maneuvering.  

The factors and principles of drift correction that are involved  in S-turns are also applicable in this maneuver. As in other  ground track maneuvers, a constant radius around a point  requires the student constantly to change the angle of bank  and make numerous control changes to compensate for the  wind. The point selected for turns around a point should be  prominent and easily distinguishable, yet small enough to  present a precise reference.  

# Common Student Difficulties  Failure To Plan Properly  

Ensure the student plans properly for the ground reference  maneuver to be flown, that should include checking the  current and forecasted weather. Students often fail to take  the wind into consideration when setting up to perform  a maneuver. Point out that winds can be determined by  observing ground cues, such as flags, ripples on a pond, or  smoke. The student should be able to explain, prior to takeoff,  how to maintain desired ground track while in flight.  

# Coordination  

Remind the student that each control input causes something  else to change. Remember, a beginning student may have  difficulty not only in accomplishing the actions in the proper  sequence, but also in compensating for control inputs. Talk  the student through each maneuver to remove any doubt about  what is to be accomplished, as well as how and when it is done.  

# Division of Attention  

When performing a ground reference maneuver, students  have a tendency to focus attention outside the helicopter,  excluding cockpit or instrument checks or focus entirely on  the interior checks to the exclusion of outside references.  If the student focuses all attention outside the helicopter, a  good way to refocus attention inside is to pose a question,  such as “What is the helicopter’s altitude?” or “What is the  airspeed?” If the student’s attention is focused inside the  helicopter, have the student clear the helicopter or describe  what he or she is using as an outside reference.  

# Attitude  

Remember that the forward seating position and the  excellent visibility in most helicopters may make it difficult  for a student to visualize the attitude of the helicopter. It  is important for the instructor to provide all the assistance  possible to ensure the student can determine an attitude by  some visual reference such as a cross-member or point on the  wind screen. A water soluble marker can be used to place dots  on the bubble representing the sight picture of the horizon at a  given airspeed. Instructors usually develop different methods  of teaching attitude references.  

# Scan  

It is common for a student to concentrate on one factor to  the exclusion of others. Due to poor scanning technique,  the student may select a ground reference that fails to offer  a suitable emergency landing area within gliding distance.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 A student will attempt to imitate instructor actions.  Do not take shortcuts. Instill safety from the first day.  Insist the student clear the helicopter in all directions  prior to performing any maneuver.  

•	 Stay close to the controls at all times, but especially  during the hover. Be prepared for both the expected  and the unexpected.  

•	 Students transitioning to helicopters from airplanes  may have “air sense” but, remember, they are still  students. Students do the unexpected, especially  students who are transitioning from airplanes to  helicopters, and should be closely supervised. There  are many negative transfers of training from airplanes  to helicopters. In instances of stress, the airplane pilot  can be expected to revert to “first learned” behaviors,  which can have deadly consequences in helicopters.  The differences should be well explained and briefed  before each flight.  

When a student encounters difficulty in mastering  an objective, find a means of allowing some degree  of success. For example, when practicing climbing  and descending turns, rather than have the student  attempt the entire maneuver, try having him or her  practice climbing and descending. When no difficulty  is experienced, add the turn, continue until the entire  maneuver is completed. Should difficulty still occur,  back up a step and work on climb and level-off and  descent and level-off rather than cause too much  frustration. Sometimes instructors make the mistake  of continuing to have students attempt a maneuver  when performance is deteriorating. It is better to quit  at that point and go back to something the student can  do well to rebuild his or her confidence. Remember,  3 or 4 iterations of each task is sufficient training.  After that point, the instructor is probably wasting the  student’s time and money. Fatigue occurs, and training  ends. More preflight briefing and ground school may  be needed.  

•	 Beginning with the first flight, students learn to preplan  the performance parameters for the entire flight.  

1.	 Power required to hover (OGE, IGE) 2. 	 Total power available 3.	 Power available at the highest altitude and  temperature for the day.  

4. 	 Hover requirements at the highest altitude and  temperature for that day.  

It is essential to discuss the meeting of these parameter  values and to ensure that the student understands the  limitations imposed by these values, even if the RFM  does not state them as limits.  [Figure 10-16]  

Basic Flight Maneuvers  

# Objective  

The purpose of this lesson is for the student to learn how to turn at a hover. The student will demonstrate a basic  ability to turn the helicopter at a hover.  

# Content  

1. Preflight Discussion

   a. Discuss lesson objective and completion standards.

   b. Review normal checklist procedures coupled with introductory material.

   c. Review weather analysis

   d. Explain to the student that maneuvering close to the ground and obstacles is a major component of the 

     helicopter’s operational environment, particularly in confined areas and when clearing a parking area. This is 

     an important exercise that must be mastered completely.

   e. Review basic helicopter aerodynamics.  

2. Instructor Actions

   a. Preflight used as introductory tool

   b. Describe the techniques for making hovering turns and stress the following points:

     1) Discuss Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE).

     2) There can be problems with yaw control and a need for increased power when the helicopter is downwind 

       or crosswind in strong wind conditions.

     3) Clearing the helicopter is important during all hovering maneuvers and, in particular, for low obstacles that 

       are hard to see and that can snag the landing gear or tail rotor.

     4) In strong or gusty wind conditions, a turn away from into the wind should be in the opposite direction to the 

       torque reaction (i.e., to the left in a helicopter with a counterclockwise turning rotor). In this way it is possible

       to ensure there is sufficient tail rotor control available. If control limits are reached at this stage, a safe return

       to into-wind is easily accomplished.

     5) No turns or any movements from the hover should be initiated until the helicopter is settled in an accurate 

       hover at the required rpm and power setting.

     6) The continuous use of high power in this exercise means that a careful watch should be kept on engine 

       temperatures and pressures. Prolonged hovering out of the wind should be avoided on some types of 

       helicopter because of the dangers from carbon monoxide in the cockpit.

     7) In some helicopters at certain center of gravity (CG) configurations (i.e., high cabin loading), it is possible to 

       reach the aft cyclic limits when hovering downwind. Warn the student of this possibility and describe the safe 

       recovery actions when:

       • Turning into the wind

       • Landing straight ahead

Review the flight, preview the next lesson, and assign  Helicopter Flying Handbook,  Chapter 10, Advanced  Flight Maneuvers.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter presented some training techniques and  instructional points an instructor can use to teach hovering  flight and basic flight maneuvers. Common difficulties  students encounter when attempting to perform hovering  flight and basic maneuvers were also discussed.  

# Advanced Flight Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

Advanced maneuvers are practiced to increase the student’s  proficiency and confidence and to introduce the full  capability of the helicopter in everyday flight operations.  Basic movement in and around airports, specifically air  taxi operations, require advanced maneuvers, such as rapid  decelerations or quick stops, and necessitate a higher degree  of pilot coordination and confidence. (See the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM) paragraph 4-3-17b for additional  information.) Additional advanced maneuvers include high  altitude operations, slope landings, confined area operations,  and pinnacle landings. Practicing rapid decelerations, or  quick stops, also enhances coordination and pilot confidence.  

# Instructor’s Approach  

The Commercial Pilot Practical Test Standards (PTS)  provides a list of advanced helicopter maneuvers and  standards for instruction at this level. The helicopter  instructor should develop a plan to teach these maneuvers.  Beginning with the simple types and ending with the most  complex, the instructor must always keep under consideration  the helicopter type, terrain, and ambient conditions prevalent  at the time of training.  

# Scenario-Based Training  

In order to take full advantage of the student’s interest in  these maneuvers, the instructor should discuss the students  intended career path within aviation. By doing this, the  instructor can tailor a syllabus to the student’s desire with  application of specific maneuvers to related job scenarios.  

As an example, a student desires to be an Emergency  Medical Service (EMS) pilot in a large metropolitan area in  the northeastern United States. Rapid decelerations, slope  landings, confined areas, and pinnacle landings take on  greater meaning to the student when portrayed as events  typically encountered during EMS operations. The instructor  can demonstrate the need for proficient and safe conduct  of these maneuvers while replicating probable profiles the  student will encounter. Scenarios involving patient pickup or  drop-off in varying conditions and locations, such as sloping  confined areas, pinnacle approaches to rooftop helipads,  etc., maximizes the student’s interest in these maneuvers,  as well as, correlates directly to future situations likely to  be encountered.  

Another example would be a student desiring to become a  long line pilot in the mountainous areas of western Canada.  Scenarios designed to elevate the student’s awareness of high  altitude, out of ground effect (OGE) training will probably  engage and energize the student.  

Regardless of the student’s desired career path, all scenarios  should replicate environmental and situational conditions.  Using the building block theory, begin training these tasks  at normal helicopter configurations. Once the student  demonstrates the understanding and coordination necessary  for these tasks, progress to more demanding scenarios. For  instance, add additional weight to simulate a max gross  weight simulated condition. If environmental conditions  allow, conduct brownout/whiteout training. Always stress  the need to accomplish and review performance planning  before each flight.  

The end state goal is for the student to not only demonstrate  proficiency of a maneuver, but to conduct the maneuver with  a firm understanding of the environmental and situational  impacts that will assist the student in avoiding potentially  life threatening circumstances.  

# Identification, Prevention, and Recovery  

A very important instructional point is to ensure students  are thoroughly familiar with identification, prevention, and  recovery from the hazards discussed in the Helicopter Flying  Handbook, Chapter 13, Helicopter Emergencies.  

The student must understand that for some hazards,  prevention is the only action, because there may be no  recovery once the hazard is fully developed. The old adage of  “I’d rather be on the ground wishing I could fly, than being in  the sky wishing I were on the ground” holds a lot of weight.  

Identification, prevention, and recovery can be illustrated  using the following example.  

Takeoffs from a muddy or tall grass location entail  forethought. Identify the hazard before action is taken. A skid  may stick in the mud or a log or other obstacle may elude  detection from the pilot on takeoff. Identifying the potential  hazards and taking the appropriate steps could prevent  the potential for dynamic rollover or other unrecoverable  mishaps. Understanding this, the best approach is to slowly  lift off, while being mindful of the necessary recovery steps  should you feel the aircraft begin to roll.  

# Reinforce Fundamentals  

The importance of positive habit transfer and the role the  instructor plays in demonstrating the proper procedures  cannot be overstated. A less experienced pilot will do what he  or she has seen the instructor do. Therefore, it is imperative  that the instructor continue to demonstrate good basic  maneuver skills throughout the advance maneuver training.  

The helicopter instructor should continue to emphasize  appropriate use of checklists and instruction on how to  accomplish the checklist while maintaining control of the  helicopter and situational awareness. Clarify abort procedures  with the student and stress that it is the pilot’s responsibility  to brief a passenger on abort options.  

Discuss the various methods for determining aircraft takeoff,  cruise, and departure performance. Integrate the use of  performance charts in the preflight planning for every flight.  

# Reconnaissance Procedures  

An important component of advanced flight maneuvers  is the ability to obtain information by first conducting a  reconnaissance. Quite simply put, reconnaissance is gathering  information. The student should not only understand the  types of reconnaissance, but also what type of information  is obtained by each reconnaissance. The student must  understand the correlation and value of this information.  

By correlation, it is implied that a lone building near a field  that the pilot intends to land, should in most cases, have  electric power. Not seeing the wires does not mean they are  not there. Thorough reconnaissance may reveal an unseen  set of wires. Certain expectations (wires) are correlated to  certain situations (buildings).  

Remember, reconnaissance begins at the planning table.  Conduct thorough performance planning to determine if OGE  power is available. Once arriving in the area is not the time to  find out if it is needed. Use available map data to determine  the terrain in the area to be flown. Identify valleys, canyons,  and mountains that can produce unforgiving hazards.  

# High Reconnaissance  

There are three recommended flight patterns flown to conduct  high reconnaissance: circular, racetrack, and when terrain  dictates, the figure eight. Regardless of the type flown, the  flight pattern should be conducted at an altitude that maintains  clearance from any and all obstructions and at an altitude  that allows safe egress from any possible environmental  phenomenon, such as downdrafts, updrafts, turbulence, and  varying wind velocities. Always be vigilant of the terrain  and its effects on wind.  

When beginning the high reconnaissance, ensure the student  maintains visual awareness with the terrain and maintains  aircraft airspeed limitations. Point out that the flight pattern  should be maintained relatively close to the landing area  and viewed from the pilot’s side of the helicopter. Stress,  however, that aircraft maneuvers should be limited to bank  angles of   $30^{\circ}$   or less. The airspeed chosen should allow  comfortable control of the aircraft, definitely above effective  translational lift (ETL).  

During the high reconnaissance, the following elements  should be assessed:  

•	 Wind—determine direction, speed, and location of  the demarcation line and any other variables of wind  flow. •	 Obstacles—identify all obstacles to flight, physical  structures, wires, towers, trees, etc. •	 Approach path—pick an approach path over the  shortest obstacles or an area void of obstacles. Account  for winds and plan on an approach into the wind if  obstacles allow. (Demonstrate crosswind approaches  that utilize an approach path over shorter obstacles  while avoiding tail winds).  

•	 Landing area—the suitability of the landing area must  be evaluated by the pilot. o	 Is the area large enough for landing and takeoff? o	 Determine slope of the intended landing  area. Perhaps the scenario calls for loading or  unloading of cargo or passengers, is that feasible  with the perceived slope?  o	 Obstacles in and around the area. How do the  obstacles affect the wind inside the area? o	 Any surface debris that could damage the aircraft.  Is there tall grass? (Bushes or saplings may cause  tail rotor/under carriage damage.)  o	 Dust or snow may cause whiteout/brownout.  o	 Is there uneven terrain, or slopes?  • 	 Takeoff route—locate the takeoff direction (into the  wind) and lowest obstacles, and identify potential  forced landing areas. Does the confined area permit  repositioning to allow more room for departure?  

Remember, when teaching a student, stress that options  are always available. The primary location may not always  be acceptable. Do not force the approach or landing. If the  landing area is found to be unsuitable during any part of the  reconnaissance, abort the maneuver and attempt to identify  alternate locations nearby. Forcing the situation may lead to  catastrophic results.  

# Low Reconnaissance  

Discuss with the student how a low reconnaissance  is performed to verify information gathered by high  reconnaissance. If the information from high reconnaissance  was sufficient, then low reconnaissance can be combined with  the approach. Emphasize that the availability of power for  approach and landing is determined during the performance  planning. Stress to the student that if at any time during low  reconnaissance it is determined that conditions around the  landing area are unsafe, reconnaissance and/or the approach  are discontinued.  

Ensure the student understands the following specific  conditions, which are evaluated during low reconnaissance:  

•	 Pinpoint wind direction and effects of the wind on  surrounding terrain.  •	 Evaluate the touchdown point, size of the landing area,  slope, type of surface, and any obstructions.  •	 Determine whether the approach should be terminated  to the ground or to a hover.  •	 Evaluate the approach and departure path.  

# Ground Reconnaissance  

Explain to the student that, once the helicopter is in the area,  ground reconnaissance is used to determine a landing point,  the takeoff point, and the takeoff direction. Ensure the student  understands the following specific items, which should be  evaluated during the ground reconnaissance:  

•	 Determine wind direction and effects within the  area. •	 Determine the location of the lowest obstacles and  their relation to the wind direction.  •	 Evaluate the area to determine the most advantageous  takeoff location and direction.  

# Maximum Performance Takeoff  

Maximum performance takeoff is practiced to simulate a  takeoff from a confined area with a climb over an obstacle.  Normally, it is begun from the ground with the collective  raised to obtain maximum power while the pitch attitude is  adjusted to establish a near vertical climb to clear an obstacle.  Height of obstacle permitting, at an altitude of about 50 feet,  the nose is lowered gently to accelerate to normal climb  speed, attaining efficiency of ETL. The pilot should always be  watching the rotor disk in the climb and the distance between  the rotor disk and the obstructions should not narrow. If the  rotor disk is not clearing the obstruction, then the helicopter,  which is suspended under the rotor disk, will not clear the  obstructions as well. This is an early indication to abort the  takeoff and to possibly try another position. Some penetration  of the crosshatched or shaded areas of the height/velocity  diagram may be unavoidable during this maneuver.  

Stress to the student that the lowest climb angle possible should  be used, both to improve climb performance and to minimize  the time in the restricted area of the high/velocity diagram.  

# Instructional Points  

Before attempting a maximum performance takeoff, bring the  helicopter to hover and determine the excess power available  by noting the difference between the power available and the  power required to hover. Under certain conditions, there may  not be sufficient power available to complete the maneuver.  Also perform a balance and flight control check and note the  position of the cyclic.  

Explain to the student the aerodynamic advantages of  initiating this maneuver from the ground. That is, an in- ground-effect (IGE) hover requires less power due to:  

•	 The reduced induce flow through the rotor disk  (resulting from the displacement of induced airflow  by the ground).  

•	 The lift vector increases (using a lesser blade angle  for the same amount of lift). •	 Because the surface area disperses the airflow outward,  the blade tip vortices are reduced resulting in larger  portions of the blade producing lift.  

This discussion helps the student understand the need to use  the maximum power available, while IGE, to establish a  climb over the obstacle.  

Explain the practice of selecting go/no-go criteria, both from  a performance planning aspect and as a reference point along  the flightpath. If, upon reaching this predetermined point, a  climb has not been established that allows clearance over  the obstacle within power/rotor limits, abort the maneuver.  

Have the student establish a proposed flightpath that  maintains rotor and skid/wheel clearance along the entire  flightpath. It is crucial that the student understand that at  any time it appears that the maneuver cannot be completed  (due to lack of available power or other limitations) or that  the obstacle cannot be cleared, the student can abort the  maneuver. Descending rearward along the same flightpath  is a viable option. It cannot be stressed enough that pulling  more power may cause rotor RPM droop with horrendous  consequences.  

Have the student position the helicopter into the wind and  return the helicopter to the surface. Normally, this maneuver  is initiated from the surface.  [Figure 11-1]  After checking the  area for obstacles and other aircraft, select reference points  along the takeoff path to maintain ground track. Consider  alternate routes in case the maneuver cannot be completed. Begin the takeoff by getting the helicopter light on the  skids/landing gear. At this time, have the student pause  and neutralize all aircraft movement. The student should  then slowly increase the collective (to allow the engine to  

![](images/1a1c8d898effe064c9ce1e5197857fc30c89f92389b25a1c73bc824bd4762799.jpg)  
Figure 11-1.   Maximum performance takeoff.  

achieve and maintain full power) and position the cyclic so  the helicopter leaves the ground in a 40-knot attitude. This  is approximately the same attitude as when the helicopter  is light on the skids/landing gear. Continue to increase  the collective slowly until reaching the maximum power  available. Ensure the student is aware that the large collective  movement requires a substantial corresponding antitorque  pedal input to maintain heading. During the maneuver, use the  cyclic as necessary to control movement toward the desired  flightpath and climb angle.  

An alternate method is a vertical climb with allowing a  vertical abort back down whereas the 40 knot attitude lift  off requires aborting with backwards flight. If the 40 knot  attitude takeoff is chosen, some landmark should be selected  as a reference in the case of an aborted takeoff to ensure the  tailrotor is not backed into an obstruction.  

Maintaining rotor revolutions per minute (rpm) at its  maximum is vital. A rotor droop and/or decrease in power  causes the aircraft to descend. Maintain these inputs until  the helicopter clears the obstacle or until reaching 50 feet  for demonstration purposes. Then, establish a normal climb  attitude and reduce power.  

Reinforce to the student that smooth, coordinated inputs  coupled with precise control allow the helicopter to attain  its maximum performance.  

Maximum performance takeoff in most light helicopters  require operation within the crosshatched or shaded areas of  the height/velocity curve. An engine failure while operating  within the shaded area may not allow enough time for the  critical transition from powered flight to autorotation. Check  engine condition by monitoring the engine instruments and  apply maximum power smoothly and slowly in order to  prevent exceeding the engine limitations.  

# Common Student Difficulties Coordination  

Power, pitch attitude, and directional control are all essential  when performing a smooth transition from the surface to a  maximum performance climb. The student must set power  smoothly, yet promptly, to the maximum allowable manifold  pressure while maintaining maximum rpm. Proper pitch  attitude must be established to ensure the helicopter accelerates  to the desired climb speed as it gains altitude. The student  should avoid abrupt or uncoordinated control application.  

# Airspeed  

A common problem for students when doing a maximum  performance takeoff is finding the proper airspeed for the  maneuver. A steep climb coupled with a low airspeed could  result in insufficient power to take off. This may result in  low rpm followed by sinking and a possible hard landing or  landing in the trees. Neither option is desirable. The other  extreme is accelerating to an airspeed higher than necessary,  resulting in a takeoff profile that is not steep enough. Revisit  the positive effects of ETL on power requirements while  stressing the importance of maintaining clearance along the  departure path. The increased rotor efficiency of passing  through ETL should be achieved as soon as possible to reduce  power requirements.  

# Running/Rolling Takeoff  

A running takeoff, while not normally used, is practiced to  simulate conditions that could exist as a result of high density  altitude and/or a high gross weight. The student must be  aware of the performance characteristics of the helicopter and  the techniques to be used if sufficient power is not available  to permit hovering in ground effect.  

While conducting performance planning, have the student  calculate power for a series of weights at 3 feet and check  loading versus performance for that particular helicopter.  Use this power-to-weight ratio, if feasible, in scenario-driven  lesson plans utilizing increased gross weights. During the  flight, validate the calculations and demonstrate to the student  that power required to hover can be used to conduct running/ rolling takeoffs. From a hover, accelerate the helicopter  forward along the ground, until ETL permits a takeoff.  Instructors should point out that, during this maneuver,  altitude should remain constant until ETL is reached and the  student should not lift up and down on the collective, which  could cause the skids to touch the ground.  

# Instructional Points  

Demonstrate the following to the student:  

•	 For helicopters equipped with skids, it may be better  to practice running takeoffs on a hard surface runway  instead of a grassy field. There is less probability of  catching a skid, which could lead to dynamic rollover.  In addition, check the condition of the skid shoes before  and after practicing running takeoffs and landing. •	 To begin the maneuver, align the helicopter to the  takeoff path.  [Figure 11-2]  Next, increase the throttle

to obtain takeoff rpm (if applicable) and smoothly  increase the collective until the helicopter becomes  light on the skids for landing gear.  

•	 Move the cyclic slightly forward of the neutral  hovering position and apply additional collective to  start the forward movement. To simulate a reduced  power condition during practice, use one to two  inches/pounds of torque less power than required to  hover. Do not apply any forward cyclic to start the  forward motion until simulated maximum power  has been applied. Applying forward cyclic before  maximum available power is obtained may cause the  helicopter to dig into the ground, requiring even more  power to break free.  

•	 Maintain a straight ground track with lateral cyclic  and heading with antitorque pedals until a climb is  established. As ETL is gained, the helicopter becomes  airborne in a fairly level attitude with little or no  pitching.  

•	 Maintain an altitude to take advantage of ground effect  and allow the airspeed to increase toward normal  climb speed. Then, follow a climb profile that takes  the helicopter through the clear area of the height/ velocity diagram. During practice maneuvers, after  climbing to an altitude of 50 feet, establish the normal  climb power setting and attitude.  

# Common Student Difficulties RPM  

It takes self-discipline to keep from raising the collective  when the helicopter is about to become airborne. Emphasize  to the student that increasing collective above the maximum  available power may only result in a loss of rpm, producing a  loss of lift, rather than an increase. This can be demonstrated  in a hover by raising the collective while reducing throttle to  maintain manifold pressure or torque pressure.  

# Attitude Control  

It initially requires more forward cyclic control to accelerate  the helicopter on the ground, against the resistance of the  skids/landing gear, than it does to maintain the slightly nose- down attitude required for acceleration in the air. As effective  translational lift is gained, the tendency may be to hold the  attitude and climb too rapidly. However, lowering the nose  too much after becoming airborne may result in the helicopter  settling back to the surface. Once airborne, the helicopter  should be held in ground effect until climb speed is reached.  

# Wind  

Explain to the student that the greater the headwind  component, the easier it is to get the helicopter off the  ground when power is limited. All available means should  be exercised to determine wind direction accurately before  attempting the takeoff. In a crosswind, cyclic must be applied  into the wind to keep the ground track parallel. Maintain this  attitude even after leaving the ground. Only after climb speed  is reached and the climb has begun, should the helicopter be  crabbed into the wind.  

# Rapid Deceleration or Quick Stop  

A rapid deceleration, or quick stop, is used to decelerate from  forward flight to a hover. The objective of a rapid deceleration  or quick stop is to lose airspeed rapidly while maintaining  a constant heading, ensuring adequate tail rotor to ground  clearance at all times. Quick stops are practiced to improve  coordination and to increase proficiency in maneuvering a  helicopter. As the student gains coordination and proficiency  in the maneuver, conduct the maneuver with a crosswind.  From previous discussion of aerodynamics, the student  should realize that downwind decelerations or quick stops  are not recommended and that every effort should be made  to avoid them.  

# Instructional Points  

During initial training, always perform this maneuver into the  wind. As discussed above, once the student has demonstrated  sound coordination and proficiency, conduct training with  crosswinds. It is essential that the student begin crosswind  training with light wind velocities.  [Figure 11-3]  For the  instructor, it is important to know that the maneuver is  conducted in IGE and just above ETL, which facilitate  recovery.  

After leveling off at an altitude between 25 and 40 feet,  depending on the manufacturer’s recommendations,  accelerate to the desired entry speed, which is approximately  45 knots for most training helicopters. The altitude chosen  should be high enough to avoid danger to the tail rotor during  the flare, but low enough to stay out of the crosshatched or  shaded areas of the height/velocity diagram throughout the  maneuver. In addition, this altitude should be low enough that  the helicopter can be brought to hover during the recovery.  

Initiate the deceleration by applying aft cyclic to reduce  forward speed and simultaneously lowering the collective, as  necessary, to counteract any climbing tendency. Emphasize  to the student that the timing must be exact. If too little down  collective is applied for the amount of aft cyclic applied, a  climb results. If too much down collective is applied, a descent  results. A rapid application of aft cyclic requires an equally  rapid application of down collective. As collective pitch is  lowered, apply proper antitorque pedal pressure to maintain  heading and adjust the throttle to maintain rpm.  

![](images/0cb0d5a7279ed0d3fb2cf6ba605a5f2fd3260a8fb93296606ca2acc77ad96f6f.jpg)  
Figure 11-3.   Rapid deceleration or quick stop.  

As the speed dissipates, transition to a hover by lowering  the nose and allowing the helicopter to descend to a normal  hovering altitude in level flight and at zero groundspeed.  

During the recovery, increase collective pitch as necessary  to stop the helicopter at normal hovering altitude, adjust the  throttle to maintain rpm, and apply proper antitorque pedal  pressure to maintain heading.  

Ensuring the student understands at all times where the tail  rotor is relative to the ground is the key to success for this  maneuver. As a teaching point prior to take off and, if the  helicopter rpm allows (or consult maintenance), have the  student sit in the helicopter and pull the tail boom down  until the tail stinger or guard almost touches the surface. The  student then gains the visual picture of the most nose-high  attitude in which the helicopter needs to be in most situations.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

# Coordination  

Because the quick stop demands a high degree of coordination,  the student may encounter difficulties during the initial  attempts. All flight controls are used: the cyclic to establish  the pitch attitude for the desired rate of deceleration, collective  to control altitude, throttle to maintain rpm (if applicable), and  antitorque pedals to control heading. Initial quick stops should  be practiced with a gentle deceleration rate to reduce the  amount of control required. As the student gains proficiency,  steepness of the initial flare can be increased until full down  collective is required to prevent an excessive gain in altitude.  

# Recovery  

During the recovery, the helicopter should settle gently  toward the hovering altitude. However, some students fail to  recognize the need for recovery action and allow the helicopter  to settle too rapidly as airspeed diminishes. Late application  of collective requires an abrupt input to stop the rate of  descent. As translational lift is lost and collective is increased,  forward cyclic should be applied to return to a level attitude.  In addition, as translational thrust is lost, even more antitorque  pedal must be applied and more power produced to provide  the antitorque. If stopping downwind, LTE could occur.  

# Steep Approach to a Hover  

Steep approaches are practiced to simulate approaches to  confined areas where obstacles make a normal approach  impossible. Steeper approach angles are normally used  to maintain obstacle clearance along the flightpath. After  completing a high reconnaissance, the pilot begins the final  leg approach at an altitude and angle (approximately   $15^{\circ}$  ) that  permits a continuous stabilized approach to the upper portion  of the landing area to keep the tail rotor out of contact with  other objects. This continuous approach allows the pilot to  establish and maintain that angle throughout the approach.  The pilot should be cautious of rapid rates of descent and  should continually check the closure rate. Using this technique  allows much more time to complete the low reconnaissance,  thereby allowing more time and altitude to conduct a go- around if needed. It could terminate either in a stabilized  hover about a designated spot or in a landing.  [Figure 11-4]  

![](images/7c86aa137a0ac7d3eadb35f5bcbde9b48969444106ac2198a977b3d1216ffcf8.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.   Steep approach to a hover.  

# Instructional Points  

On final approach, head the helicopter into the wind or  approach path and align it with the intended touchdown point  at the recommended approach airspeed.  

Begin the approach by intercepting an approach angle of  approximately   $15^{\circ}$  , lowering the collective sufficiently to  start the helicopter descending along the approach path, and  decelerating. Any approach angle of greater than  $15^{\circ}$   increases  the likelihood of encountering settling with power; therefore,  make certain the pilot understands the purpose of a steep- approach angle is to ensure tail rotor clearance, and does not  enter at an excessive angle. Use the proper antitorque pedal  for trim. Since this angle is steeper than a normal approach  angle, reduce the collective more than that required for normal  approach and control the rate of descent.  

Continue to decelerate with slight aft cyclic, and smoothly  lower the collective to maintain the approach angle. Remind  the student to visualize the approach angle as an imaginary  line from the landing gear to three feet above the landing point  and attempt to maintain that angle throughout the maneuver.  [Figure 11-5]  Aft cyclic is required to decelerate sooner  than on a normal approach, and the rate of closure becomes  apparent at higher altitude.  

![](images/44de7f5e506e352b35d7fd1fc61025b706b14828ee048d8ae0afcbd74621538b.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.   Approach to a three foot hover over landing spot.  

Maintain the approach angle and rate of descent with the  collective, rate of closure with the cyclic, and trim with  antitorque pedals. Initially, use a crab above 50 feet and above  the obstacles to compensate for wind. Use a slip below 50  feet for any crosswind that might be present.  

The loss of ETL occurs higher in a steep approach, requiring  an increase in the collective to prevent settling, and more  forward cyclic to achieve the proper rate of closure.  

For training, terminate the approach at hovering altitude  above the intended landing point with zero groundspeed. If  power has been properly applied during the final portion of  the approach, very little additional power is required in the  hover. The instructor should remind the student of ground  effect as the helicopter gets closer to the surface. This effect  on a well executed approach increases lift and allows the  helicopter to glide to a halt over the landing point.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Students frequently attempt to dive toward the selected  touchdown point when they seem to be overshooting it. This  only builds speed and moves the helicopter farther forward.  Frequently, the next move is to lower the collective, which  does accomplish a loss of altitude, but also results in a high  rate of descent. Conversely, when undershooting, it is a  natural tendency to raise the nose in an attempt to maintain  altitude. This leads to collective corrections, which could  lead to settling with power, or in the case of large collective  increases, leads to rotor droop, engine overspeeds, or loss  of tail rotor thrust. The student should be taught to regulate  the steepness of the approach path with collective and use  the cyclic to control the airspeed. Near the landing area, the  collective should be increased to slow the rate of descent so the  transition to a hover is accomplished as smoothly as possible.  Constant reminders to use the imaginary approach path from  the landing gear to 3 feet above the intended landing point  helps the student to not chase the landing point.  

It must be stressed to the student pilot that, if the approach is  unstable, it is best to conduct a go-around prior to descending  below the obstacles. Once below the obstacles, the required  power to conduct a climb out may not be available. If after  several attempts, the angle is too steep or environmental  conditions dictate, have the student select another landing.  

# Shallow Approach and Running/Roll-On  Landing  

The objective in a running landing is to maintain a sufficient  forward speed to take advantage of translational lift until  touchdown. As in the running takeoff, power should be  limited to less than that required to hover. A shallow final  approach should be used to maintain a low rate of descent.  Since the helicopter is sliding or rolling to a stop during this  maneuver, the landing area must be smooth and long enough  to accomplish this task.  [Figure 11-6]  

![](images/c23f3e42b9bbcc3f7933607eceb5c786f015a0c3797a8d10786bb8a973be0e16.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.   Shallow approach and running landing.  

It may become useful to the student to practice these approaches  for the purpose of relating conditions where minimal powered  approaches are required, such as fixed or loss of tail rotor  control or mechanically induced engine underspeeds.  

Additionally, under certain whiteout or brownout conditions,  shallow approaches can be made to keep the aircraft ahead  of the obscurants, allowing the pilot to see the landing  area. Extreme caution should be used when conducting this  technique. The landing area must be smooth, and precise  heading control must be maintained to avoid the possibility  of dynamic rollover.  

In any case, do not rapidly lower the collective after touchdown.  Smooth reduction of collective prevents a rapid stop that could  result in damage to the aircraft or injury to the crew.  

# Instructional Points  

For helicopters equipped with skids, it may be better to  practice running landings on a hard surface runway instead of  on a grassy field because there is less probability of catching  a skid, which can lead to dynamic rollover. In addition, check  the condition of the skid shoes before and after practicing  running takeoffs and landings.  

A shallow approach is initiated in the same manner as the  normal approach except that the student intercepts the final  approach path at a shallower angle (approximately   $5^{\circ}$   or  less). The required power to maintain this shallow angle is  more than that required for a normal approach but less than  that needed to land due to increased ground effect and partial  translational lift, depending on the wind.  

As the collective is lowered, maintain heading with proper  antitorque pressure and rpm with the throttle. Maintain  approach airspeed until the apparent rate of closure appears to  be increasing, then began to slow the helicopter with aft cyclic.  

As in normal and steep approaches, the primary control  for the angle and rate of descent is the collective, while the  cyclic primarily controls the groundspeed. However, there  must be a coordination of all the controls for the maneuver  to be accomplished successfully. The instructor should  remind the student that with any aft cyclic movement, any  collective control increase is also increasing the aft cyclic  adding more negative thrust, which can slow the helicopter  too quickly. The student should always remember the cyclic’s  effects are affected by the amount of total thrust selected by  the collective. The helicopter should arrive at the point of  touchdown at, or slightly above, ETL. Since ETL diminishes  rapidly at low airspeed, the deceleration must be coordinated  smoothly with not too much aft cyclic applied, while keeping  enough lift to prevent the helicopter from abruptly ballooning  upward, or worse, allow the rotor blades to contact the tail  boom if the landing is too harsh.  

Just prior to touchdown, place the helicopter in a level attitude  with the cyclic, and maintain heading with the antitorque  pedals. Use the cyclic to keep the heading and ground track  identical. Allow the helicopter to descend gently to the  surface in a straight-and-level attitude, cushioning the landing  with the collective.  

After surface contact, move the cyclic slightly forward to  ensure clearance between tail boom and the rotor disk. Use  the cyclic to maintain the surface track. In most cases, hold  the collective stationery until the helicopter stops. However,  if more braking action is required, lower the collective  slightly. Keep in mind that due to the increased ground  friction when the collective is lowered, the helicopter’s nose  might pitch forward. Exercise caution not to correct this  pitching movement with aft cyclic, this movement could  result in main rotor contact with the tail boom. During the  landing, maintain normal rpm with the throttle and directional  control with the antitorque pedals.  

As a teaching point, the instructor can locate a nearby visual  approach slope indicator (VASI) and help the student look up  the information on the VASI to determine the correct angle  for running or roll-on landings. Most VASI glide slopes are  set in the  $3^{\circ}$   range, so that would be a good sight picture for  the beginning student when learning the approach angle.  

# Common Student Difficulties Approach Angle  

The desired approach angle for a running landing is  recommended to be approximately   $2^{\circ}–5^{\circ}$  , somewhat  shallower than a normal approach. The student may have  difficulty visualizing and maintaining this approach angle  and achieving the correct attitude, airspeed, and rate of  descent on touchdown. Also, remember that sight pictures for  students vary, as do aircraft design. It is possible the student  has had previous instruction in another airframe or even a  fixed wing aircraft.  

# Attitude Control  

In order to achieve the desired airspeed at the proper altitude  above the touchdown point, correct pitch attitude is vital  throughout the approach and touchdown in a running landing.  Initially, the helicopter must have a slightly decelerating  attitude (nose up slightly); in the middle of the approach,  more of a gliding neutral stabilized attitude may be required.  Finally, as power must be increased to replace lift lost due  to loss of ETL, the cyclic must be adjusted to obtain the  landing attitude necessary to the landing gear to touchdown.  

As a teaching point, the instructor should have the student  fly a restricted power go-around so the student gains the  experience of the slow response under those conditions.  

# Collective Control  

Collective should not be fully lowered until the helicopter has  stopped. Students tend to lower the collective immediately  after landing, as in a normal landing from a hover. Rapidly  lowering the collective while the helicopter is still sliding  results in a deceleration rate that can impose undue stress  on the landing gear support, rotor mast, transmission, or  supporting structure.  

# Touchdown  

Common problems on touchdown include improper use of  the collective and cyclic controls. Just prior to touchdown,  there is a tendency to apply aft cyclic to cushion the landing.  This causes the tail of the skids to touch first, followed by a  forward pitching moment. A student may attempt to correct  this action with more aft. In extreme cases, this can cause  the main rotor blades to contact the tail boom. The correct  technique is to level the helicopter, use collective to cushion  the touchdown, and then apply a small amount of forward  cyclic if needed after touchdown. Collective should be held  to maintain a low rate of deceleration.  

These general procedures are for landings to a smooth hard  surface. Procedures vary for other types of surfaces, which  means that the amount of collective applied varies depending  on the surface. The instructor should never hesitate to increase  power and collective and terminate the maneuver if any  parameter is being exceeded.  

# Slope Operations  

# Slope Landings  

While landing on a gentle slope is similar to landing in a  crosswind, landing on a slope approaching the maximum  capability of the helicopter requires smooth, yet positive,  control.  [Figure 11-7]  Prior to flight, revisit the basics with  the student prior to performing maximum angle slopes. Putting  the right skid or wheel upslope allows greater lateral control  due to translating tendency (counterclockwise rotating rotor  systems). Conversely, a left skid/wheel upslope restricts  the amount of lateral cyclic available. Depending on winds,  discuss with the student that it is easier to land on the slope  where the uphill side is to the right and the wind is coming  from the downslope side.  

The student should also understand it is preferable to land  the helicopter uphill from people so they can approach the  helicopter from the downhill side. Approaching from the  downhill side provides greater main rotor clearance between  the rotor system and the downward sloping ground.  

Slope limitations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. It is  important to emphasize that personal, physical, or mechanical  limits may be reached before manufacturer’s limits. Personal  limits are reached when the pilot simply feels uncomfortable  with continuing the approach. A pilot does not need to reach  any of the other limits to get to this point. If it does not feel  right to the student, abort the maneuver and try again.  

In the case of physical limits, it is possible the student will find  the cyclic restricted by either a leg or a kneeboard. Perhaps in  situations where dual controls are installed the pilot may make  cyclic contact with the passenger’s leg or his/her own leg or  kneeboard. In that case, abort the maneuver and find another  location and/or reposition objects within the flight control area.  

The surface of the slope can also be a limiting factor. If  the surface is gravel, skid landing gear may not rest on the  slope without sliding. If the surface is damp grass, it may  be too slick for the helicopter to stay on the slope. An icy  slope may only be suitable for offloading or loading but not  for a complete shutdown. A thorough visual assessment of  the surface should always be done when possible before  attempting to land on a slope.  

Mechanical limiting may occur if the aircraft rigging limit  is preventing continuation of the maneuver. Mechanical  resistance against the cyclic is felt. In this case, abort the  

![](images/c0de602ccc1e2fddcaa8463fdf327fe692390ca8702ed7a5e0222e827615fc26.jpg)  
Figure 11-7.   Slope landing.  

maneuver, analyze the contributing factors, and reposition  to another location, selecting a shallower slope.  

If, at any point during the slope landing the student feels  uncomfortable, abort the landing and reposition to a location  where the limiting factors can be eliminated.  

The limits of the helicopter’s capability are discernible before  the helicopter is committed to landing, as long as the student  proceeds slowly and remains alert for sliding or for the cyclic  control approaching the lateral travel limits. Proper technique  on a slope landing eliminates the risk of dynamic rollover or  sliding downslope.  

The performance and techniques involved with different  types of helicopter on sloping ground vary. This exercise  should be tailored to meet the performance of the training  helicopter. Students tend to be very tense when introduced  to sloping ground operations, are likely to overcontrol, and  tire quickly. Before introducing this exercise, ensure the  student demonstrates proficiency at hovering and standard  takeoffs and landings.  

# Instructional Points  

Prior to performing this maneuver, several briefings and  discussions should take place. The first point to discuss is  the student’s depth of understanding of dynamic rollover. As  previously stated, take time to discuss the reasons and events  that lead up to dynamic rollover. Let the student lead the  discussion and determine his or her level of understanding.  Does the student simply apply rote memorization in the  discussion or does there appear to be a level of understanding  that leads to application and correlation?  

The second vital discussion centers around the decision and  procedure of aborting the maneuver. As already stated, the  student will be tense during the maneuver. Discussion on the  proper flight control inputs required to recover the aircraft is  essential to safe execution of the maneuver.  

The third discussion should be about where to go after  the maneuver was terminated and then to analyze why the  maneuver was aborted. Remember to provide positive,  meaningful feedback to the student.  

Make the initial approach to the slope at a  $45^{\circ}$   angle to check  the suitability of the landing site. At the termination of the  approach, move the helicopter slowly toward the slope, being  careful not to turn the tail upslope. Position the helicopter  across the slope at a stabilized hover headed into the wind  over the spot of intended landing.  

Maintain heading with proper antitorque pressure, using  caution to not overcontrol with the pedals. Ensure the student  relates left yaw inputs as a critical condition for dynamic  rollover in helicopters with counterclockwise rotating rotor  systems.  

Downward pressure on the collective starts the helicopter  descending. As the upslope skid touches the ground, hesitate  momentarily in a level attitude, then apply lateral cyclic in the  direction of the slope. This holds the upslope skid against the  slope while the downslope skid is lowered with the collective.  Ideally, the student understands that by keeping the rotor  disk level, the lift vector is kept in a near vertical state. As  the collective is lowered, continue to move the cyclic toward  the slope to maintain a fixed position.  

The slope must be shallow enough so the helicopter can be  held against it with the cyclic during the entire landing. A  slope of  $5^{\circ}$   is considered maximum for normal operation of  most helicopters.  

Be aware of any abnormal vibration or mast bumping, which  signals maximum cyclic deflection. If this occurs, abandon  the landing because the slope is too steep. In most helicopters  with a counterclockwise rotor system, landings can be made  on steeper slopes when the cyclic is being held to the right.  When landing on slopes using left cyclic, some cyclic input  must be used to overcome the translating tendency. If the  wind is not a factor, consider the drifting tendency when  determining landing direction.  

After the downslope skid is on the surface, reduce the  collective to full down, and neutralize the cyclic and  antitorque pedals. In helicopters requiring manual throttle  manipulation, normal operating rpm should be maintained  until the full weight of the helicopter is on the landing gear.  This ensures adequate rpm for immediate takeoff in case  the helicopter starts sliding down the slope. Use antitorque  pedals as necessary throughout the landing for heading  control. Before reducing the rpm, move the cyclic control as  necessary to make sure the helicopter is firmly on the ground.  

Once proficiency has been demonstrated, let the student make  the decision as to where to land. This allows the instructor to  judge the student’s ability to evaluate slopes.  

Start the student on a shallow slope and gradually increase  the difficulty level as proficiency improves.  

Ensure the student is shown some slopes which are a mix of  cross slope and up/down slope, so that the helicopter has to  be landed diagonally on the slope.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Overcontrolling  

The student’s concern about the possibility of sliding or  overturning usually leads to more uphill cyclic input than is  required. The effects of excessive cyclic are not noticeable as  the collective is lowered, since the helicopter has no tendency  to slide uphill, but the limits of cyclic travel may be reached  earlier than if the student were using only enough uphill  cyclic to prevent sliding.  

# Loss of Reference  

Students tend to look at the ground close to the aircraft.  Overcontrolling frequently results and it is often necessary  to remind the student to raise his or her eyes and use the  horizon as a reference.  

# Slope Takeoff  

The takeoff from a slope is much easier than the landing  because the helicopter is already resting on the slope.  [Figure 11-8]  The student must be briefed not to turn away  from the slope while still at a hover because this moves the  tail toward the slope. Have the student slide away from the  slope and conduct a turn about the tail to ensure the tail is clear  of the sloping terrain. Begin by initiating the climb on the  takeoff heading or, if obstacles dictate taking off downslope,  move sideward before beginning the turn.  

# Instructional Points  

Begin the takeoff by increasing rpm to the normal range  with the collective full down, then move the cyclic toward  the slope. Position the cyclic to level the rotor disk and apply  enough lateral cyclic to hold the landing gear on the slope in  position as the collective is slowly increased.  

As the skid comes up, move the cyclic toward the neutral  position. If properly coordinated, the helicopter should attain  a normal attitude as the cyclic reaches the neutral position.  At the same time, use antitorque pedal pressure to maintain  heading and throttle to maintain rpm. With the helicopter  at a normal hovering attitude and the cyclic centered,  pause momentarily to verify everything is correct, and then  gradually raise the collective to complete the lift off.  

After reaching a hover, take care to avoid hitting the ground  with the tail rotor. If an upslope wind exists, execute a  crosswind takeoff and then make a turn into the wind after  clearing the ground with the tail rotor.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Eager to get the helicopter back into a level attitude, the  student may use excessive cyclic into the slope or apply  up collective too rapidly. Emphasize that smoothness is  essential to a safe, comfortable takeoff. Cyclic should be  positioned into the slope before the collective is raised. The  rotor disk should be checked visually to see that it is level  with the natural horizon or inclined slightly toward the slope.  Increasing the collective slowly enables the pilot to remove  the lateral cyclic input so the helicopter is level when the  upslope skid leaves the ground. Antitorque pedal input is  gradually increased as the cyclic is raised, preventing a  turning tendency. Caution the student to stabilize the hover  before beginning the climb.  

# Confined Area Operations  

A confined area is an area in which the flight of the helicopter  is limited in some direction by terrain or the presence of  obstructions. For example, a clearing in the woods, a city  street, road, parking lot, or a building roof or medical landing  pad can be regarded as a confined area.  [Figure 11-9] Generally, takeoffs and landings should be made into the wind  to obtain maximum airspeed with minimum groundspeed.  This is a comprehensive exercise that may require more than  one session of preparatory ground instruction.  

Another critical aspect of confined area operations involves  the student’s ability to estimate the size of the confined area  as it relates to the helicopter. Tips on how to visualize the  placement of the helicopter in the confined area are very  helpful. A good exercise for obstruction judgment is to hold  a broom around the edges of the rotor disk, not just the front.  

![](images/39dfc3be538e5328282718078459e753fcdde72f905405edc341e54e78625c90.jpg)

Figure 11-9.   If the wind velocity is 10 knots or greater, expect updrafts on the windward side and downdrafts on the lee side of obstacles.  Plan the approach with these factors in mind, but be ready to alter plans if the wind speed or direction changes.  

Blade strikes usually occur on the side of the helicopter. Ask  the student if the blades would miss the broom to help build  judgment. As training progresses, the instructor should point  out wires and dead tree limbs hiding in plain sight, invisible  under most circumstances when airborne.  

If there is a shortage of suitable confined areas in the local  training area, consider planning cross-country navigation  exercises to locations that may have more suitable training  areas. When introduced to this exercise, most students  require more than one orbit of the area to obtain all the  information they require. Encourage cutting down this  number as proficiency increases, until experience reduces it  to a practical minimum.  

# Instructional Points Approach and Landing  

There are several things to consider when operating in  confined areas. One of the most important is maintaining  a clearance between the rotors and obstacles forming the  confined area. The tail rotor deserves special consideration  because in some helicopters it cannot always be seen from  the cabin. This not only applies while making the approach,  but while hovering as well.  

Exercises in distance and size estimation can assist the student  in creating a reference base for the dimensions needed to land  in a confined area. Simple cues such as the known dimensions  of a football field   $50\times120$   yards) can give the student a  large-scale reference. An automobile parking space   $(9\times18$  feet) can help the student judge smaller distances as they  correlate to the footprint of the helicopter. Ask the student  for the size of the confined area while he or she is conducting  the high reconnaissance. This provides information about the  student’s ability to capture this information.  

Keep in mind that wires are especially difficult to see, but  their supporting devices, such as poles or towers, serve as an  indication of their presence and approximate height. If any  wind is present, expect some turbulence.  

Consider the availability of forced landing areas during the  planned approach. Think about the possibility of flying from  one alternate landing area to another throughout the approach,  while avoiding unfavorable areas. Always leave a way out  in case the landing cannot be completed or a go-around is  necessary.  

A high reconnaissance should be completed before initiating  a confined area approach. Start the approach phase using  the wind to the best possible advantage. Keep in mind areas  suitable for a forced landing. It may be necessary to choose  between an approach that is crosswind but over an open area  and one directly into the wind but over heavily wooded or  extremely rough terrain where a safe forced landing would be  impossible. If these conditions exist, consider the possibility  of making the initial phase of the approach crosswind of the  open area and then turning into the wind for the final portion  of the approach.  

Always operate the helicopter as close to its normal  capabilities as possible considering the situation at hand.  In all confined area operations, with the exception of the  pinnacle operation, the angle of descent should be no steeper  than necessary to clear any barrier in the approach path and  still land on the selected spot.  

Always make the landing to a specific point and not to some  general area. This point should be located well forward, away  from the approach end of the area. The more confined the area,  the more essential it is that the helicopter be landed precisely at  a definite point. Keep this point in sight during the entire final  approach. Use forward and lateral cues near the termination  point to assist in maintaining the desired glidepath.  

When flying a helicopter in confined areas, always consider  the tail rotor. A safe angle of descent over barriers must be  established to ensure tail rotor clearance of all obstacles.  After coming to a hover, take care to avoid turning the tail  into obstructions.  

Alert the student to the problem of losing the wind when  the helicopter descends below the height of the obstacle,  normally on the final stages of the approach. Have the  student plan and think ahead of the aircraft. Discuss the  consequences of less wind upon descending into the confined  area. Does the student comprehend that losing favorable wind  velocity may have the same effect as losing ETL? Help the  student anticipate the potential increased rate of descent and  corresponding need for power.  

# Takeoff  

A confined area takeoff is considered an “altitude over  airspeed” maneuver. This means it is more important to gain  altitude than airspeed. Make the best takeoff possible to attain  a normal attitude and climb airspeed to avoid or exit the  crosshatched or shaded areas of the height/velocity diagram  as quickly as possible. Because this is primarily an altitude  acquiring maneuver, it usually requires lowering the nose to  gain airspeed after the obstructions are cleared.  

Before takeoff, make a ground reconnaissance to determine  the type of takeoff to be performed. Doing so helps determine  the point in which the takeoff should be initiated to ensure  the maximum amount of available area, and how to best  maneuver the helicopter from the landing point to the  proposed takeoff position.  

If wind conditions and available area permit, the helicopter  should be brought to a hover, turned around, and hovered  forward from the landing position to the takeoff position.  Under certain conditions, sideward flight to the takeoff  position may be necessary. If rearward flight is required  to reach the takeoff position, the pilot must attempt to see  what is behind the helicopter prior to hovering backwards.  Hovering backward in a confined area is not recommended  unless the pilot is absolutely sure that the area is clear of  trees, high sloping terrain, or any other obstacle that the tail  rotor could strike. If there is no other option and there are  two pilots available, it would be beneficial to get out of the  helicopter and visually inspect the area first.  

When planning a takeoff, consider power available, wind  direction, obstructions, and forced landing areas. The angle  of climb on takeoff should be normal, or at least no steeper  than necessary to clear any barrier. It is better to clear a barrier  by a few feet while maintaining normal operating rpm with  perhaps a reserve of power, than to clear a barrier by a wide  margin but with a dangerously low rpm and no power reserve.  

As an aid in helping to fly up and over an obstacle, have  the student form an imaginary line from a point on the  leading edge of the helicopter to the highest obstacle to be  cleared. Fly this line of ascent with enough power to clear  the obstacle. As a rule of thumb, during the climbout, if there  is an observed distance between the rotor tip-path plane  and the obstacle, the obstacle will most likely be cleared.  After clearing the obstacle, maintain the power setting and  accelerate to the normal climb speed. Then, reduce power to  the normal climb power setting. The instructor should also  explain that the leading edge of the landing gear needs to  clear the obstructions as well. Often, the student begins to  get in a hurry and nose the helicopter over to speed up the  process, but this lack of patience could cause the landing gear  to contact leaves and limbs. The student must observe where  both points are relative to the obstruction(s) during takeoff.  

In the event that it appears the helicopter will not clear the  obstacle (i.e., the tip-path plane is below the obstacle), take  the appropriate action to abort the takeoff. This decision  should be made earlier in the approach rather than waiting  until the student finds the helicopter at maximum power  and with fewer options available. Demonstrate that aircraft  control can be maintained by flying the aircraft back down  the flightpath if necessary.  

If the student is going to pursue flight at higher elevations and  small areas, training in the vertical takeoff method with aborts  back into the confined area would be advisable to demonstrate  the different performance of the helicopter. Proper heading  control is very important to maintain tail rotor clearances.  Aborted confined area takeoffs should terminate close to the  forward barriers to ensure tail rotor clearance.  

All instructors should have designated confined areas  established to conduct various proficiency based levels of  training. A new student will probably need a large open area.  As coordination and proficiency levels increase, the student  should be introduced to smaller, more challenging confined  areas. Those same smaller confined areas are suitable for  training of more advanced students, such as a commercial  pilot applicants.  

Several areas should be used to give the student every  opportunity to consider all of the factors that influence  operation into and out of confined areas. Have the student fly  over a projected landing area and then describe the factors  involved in a landing to that specific area. Items such as wind  direction, favorable approach path, suitable forced landing  areas, obstacles to be cleared, where turbulence might be  encountered, and the helicopters expected performance  should be discussed relative to each approach. The student  must also consider the performance capability of the  helicopter when planning a departure from a confined area.  

As an instructor, maintain awareness of the disadvantages  of seasonal training. A student that learns these maneuvers  in the fall or winter months will not be prepared for the  environmental consequences of warmer weather. Discuss  this with the student, increasing general awareness of the  potential impact of different seasonal conditions. A good  discussion on performance would include having the student  compare the charted and experienced performance values  against those from a typical hot summer day. If the charts  furnish sufficient information, the instructor might be able  to adjust the power to simulate that of a hot summer day and  how the helicopter performance is different.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

Safety of the approach depends mainly on the thoroughness of  the planning that precedes it. Students may not recognize and  prepare for hard-to-see obstacles, such as power lines. Explain  that supporting structures indicate the presence of lines.  

In a desire to make an approach directly into the wind, the  student might fly over areas unsuitable for a safe landing.  Advise the student that it is often preferable to make the  approach with a slight crosswind, remaining downwind of  potential landing areas, if possible. Should there be a need to  conduct an emergency landing, turning toward the landing  area would allow the approach to be conducted into the wind.  

Upon completion of the maneuver, discuss with the student any  points that may need to be addressed. It is easier for the student  to talk this through on the ground then trying to fly and listen.  

Before the takeoff is begun, ask the student to explain the  factors being considered and the procedures being planned.  This provides an opportunity to introduce factors the student  may not have considered and gives the instructor a chance  to evaluate the student’s judgment.  

# Pinnacle and Ridgeline Operations  

# Pinnacle Landings  

A discussion with the student on mountain weather and  flying techniques, regardless of the geographical location of  training, should be conducted prior to flight. Particular care  must be taken to be alert to the impact of updrafts and, most  importantly, downdrafts around the pinnacle.  

Before attempting a pinnacle landing, the student must  demonstrate proficiency in precision approaches to a spot  along a constant approach path. This ability is the essence of a  good pinnacle landing. Have the student fly over the selected  pinnacle so he or she can observe obstacles and decide on a  suitable approach path, as well as determine a plan of action  if the approach does not go as planned. The final approach  should be started at a sufficient distance from the pinnacle to  enable the student to establish an approach angle appropriate  to the approach path and wind conditions. If at all possible,  a normal approach angle should be used.  

Depth perception may be difficult because the surrounding  terrain is lower and the approach angle is the only means of  judging altitude. If the landing spot stays in the same angular  relationship to the helicopter, the approach angle is constant.  If at any time during the approach it appears to be unsafe,  the approach should be abandoned according to the alternate  plan. An approach that requires excessive maneuvering near  the landing spot is unsatisfactory. Closure rate and approach  angle should be carefully monitored during the approach  because the visual cues, normally used when performing a  normal approach, may not be available, and ETL must be  maintained until the helicopter is nearly over the landing spot.  

# Instructional Points  

If a climb is needed to reach the pinnacle or ridgeline, do it  on the upwind side, when practicable, to take advantage of  any updrafts. Avoid the areas where downdrafts are present,  especially when excess power is limited.  [Figure 11-10]  The  

![](images/c20ba288c15175063299c159633f8bd2ef213ca0594b9ca35046204b4ff4c013.jpg)  
Figure 11-10.   When flying an approach to a pinnacle or ridgeline,  avoid the areas where downdrafts are present, especially when  excess power is limited. If downdrafts are encountered, it may  become necessary to make an immediate turn away from the  pinnacle to avoid being forced into the rising terrain.  

approach flightpath should be parallel to the ridgeline and  into the wind as much as possible.  

Load, altitude, wind conditions, and terrain features determine  the angle used in the final part of an approach. As a general  rule, the greater the wind, the steeper the approach needs  to be to avoid turbulent air and downdrafts. Groundspeed  during the approach is more difficult to judge because the  visual references are farther away than during approaches  over trees or flat terrain.  

If a crosswind exists, remain clear of downdrafts on the  leeward or downward side of the ridgeline. If the wind  velocity makes the crosswind landing hazardous, a low  coordinated turn into the wind just prior to terminating the  approach might be an option. When making an approach to  a pinnacle, avoid leeward turbulence and keep the helicopter  within reach of a forced landing area as long as possible.  

It is good practice to have the student plan the approach to  a 3-foot hover. Most pinnacle sites do not provide suitable  landing areas. In situations where the surface is known to  be flat, such as a roof top helipad, approaches can be made  to the surface.  

Discuss with the student that actual pinnacles may not  provide a cushion of IGE. Because the pinnacle surface  may be uneven, rocky and sloping away in all directions,  the student should anticipate the need for OGE power all  the way to the surface.  

Upon landing, take advantage of the long axis of the area if  wind conditions permit. Touchdown should be made in the  forward portion of the area. Always perform a stability check  prior to reducing rpm to ensure the landing gear is on firm  terrain that can safely support the weight of the helicopter.  

# Common Student Difficulties Planning  

As in the approach to a confined area, there are many factors  to consider. The approach should be planned to fly over the  most favorable areas and with an approach angle only as  steep as conditions warrant.  

# Approach Angle  

It may be difficult for the student to maintain a constant  approach angle due to the different visual cues, as compared  with a normal approach in flat terrain. The cyclic is used to  control the closure rate and the collective is used to regulate  the rate of descent. If the landing spot seems to be moving  away, a little forward cyclic corrects it. If the landing spot  seems to be moving under the helicopter, a slight rearward  cyclic correction is appropriate.  

# Airspeed  

Explain the importance of controlling airspeed during the  final stages of the approach. An airspeed that is too low  can cause a loss of ETL before the landing spot is reached,  requiring an OGE hover. In some cases, the entire approach  may require OGE power. An excessively high airspeed  may require excessive maneuvering to avoid overflying  the landing spot. The pitch attitude and airspeed control  procedures become more critical on a pinnacle approach.  

# Pinnacle Takeoff and Climb  

The terrain features affecting a pinnacle takeoff and a plan  to cope with the situation should be formulated on the  reconnaissance that precedes the landing. A change in wind,  temperature, or takeoff weight may make it necessary to  consider obstacles that were not a factor on the previously  planned departure. To build the habit and to be certain that all  items are being considered, the student should be required to  review and describe the factors affecting the takeoff.  

# Instructional Points  

A pinnacle takeoff is an “airspeed over altitude” takeoff  made from the ground or from a hover. Since pinnacles  and ridgelines are generally higher than the immediate  surrounding terrain, gaining airspeed on the takeoff is more  important than gaining altitude. Quickly gaining airspeeds  above ETL also allows greater separation from hazardous  terrain. In addition to covering unfavorable terrain rapidly,  a higher airspeed affords a more favorable glide angle, and  thus contributes to the chances of reaching a safe area in the  event of a forced landing. If a suitable forced landing area is  not available, a higher airspeed also permits a more effective  deceleration prior to making an autorotative landing.  

As the helicopter moves out of ground effect on takeoff,  maintain altitude and accelerate to normal climb speed.  When normal climb speed is attained, establish a normal  climb altitude. Never dive the helicopter down the slope after  clearing the pinnacle.  

# Common Student Difficulties Planning  

Failure to consider all factors involved in the takeoff and  climb, or failure to take advantage of wind, the lowest  obstacle, and favorable terrain are items that may need to  be discussed frequently. Anything the instructor notices  that could enhance the margin of safety of this or any other  operation helps build the safety consciousness of the student.  

# RPM  

As the helicopter leaves the pinnacle, ground effect is lost  almost immediately. The student may increase collective  beyond the capability of the engine to maintain rpm,  especially at high density altitudes. This possibility should  be discussed prior to takeoff and watched carefully during  the takeoff.  

# Airspeed  

The helicopter will be at altitude as soon as departing the  pinnacle. The student should be instructed to gain airspeed  rather than try to climb away from the pinnacle.  

# Night Flying  

Night flying introduces a new environment to the student  and must be preceded by thorough preparation. Briefing for  the first night flight should include, but is not limited to, the  following items:  

1.	 Equipment required for night flight 2.	 Airport and heliport lighting 3.	 Night flying physiology 4.	 Physiology of the eye 5.	 Weather considerations 6.	 Night flying techniques 7.	 Light discipline  

The student’s first night flight can be conducted at dusk so  visual impressions are introduced gradually and adaptation to  the night environment is accomplished over a period of time  rather than instantaneously.  [Figure 11-11]  The regulations  now require a night cross-country aeronautical experience  for both private and commercial pilot applicants.  

![](images/e9f8ddae8504efa6ba23dbb52aee1714e5f8ad8986101bcb8ca71402f03cdb69.jpg)  
Figure 11-11.   The student’s first night flight can be conducted at  dusk so visual impressions are introduced gradually.  

The instructor needs to teach the student light discipline  starting with the first night flight. As dusk wanes, it will be  darker on the ground sooner, so night hovering could be the  first task. Hovering should be accomplished with and without  the landing light. In many cases at a lighted airport, hovering  without the landing light can allow more visual clues as the  eyes adjust to the ambient lighting conditions.  

# Common Student Difficulties Takeoff  

Attitude control problems during the takeoff and climb to  500 feet above the ground may be caused by several factors.  Initially, the student might be tempted to look at reference  points that are too close to the helicopter, focusing on things  that can still be seen clearly. When airborne, a reference  well in front of the helicopter should be used for attitude  control. During the initial departure from a lighted area into  the darkness beyond, it is necessary to refer to the airspeed  indicator and altimeter frequently in order to confirm the  desired attitude.  

# Airborne  

Following the first night takeoff, spend a few minutes away  from the traffic pattern in a poorly lighted area. This allows  the student to relax and become acclimated to the night  environment and gain confidence in the ability to maintain  flight with minimal visual references. During this time, other  aircraft should be pointed out so the student can relate to the  appearance of their lights to their apparent motion.  

# Approach  

The standard traffic pattern should be used for training in  night approaches. Particular attention should be paid to  attitude control, to assist in visualizing the correct approach  angle. Since in-depth perception is more difficult at night,  the approach angle is especially important.  

Landings should be practiced with and without the use of  the landing light. If the landing light is used, it should be  used only on the final leg, preferably during the last 100  feet or so of descent. The student must be cautioned not to  concentrate only on the area illuminated by the landing light,  but rather to look ahead a bit for better attitude control and  depth perception. Becoming fixated on the landing light can  cause the student to misjudge the landing point and result  in a hard landing.  

# Instructional Points  

When discussing lighting, explain to the student the  effects lighting has on the eye. During the first flight,  continually adjust the cockpit lighting to the lowest level that  instrumentation can still be seen. This allows the student to  better adapt his night vision.  

On the subsequent night flight (with the aircraft on the ground  in a dark location), again dim the cockpit lighting to the  lowest comfortable level instrumentation can be seen. Have  the student identify objects outside the aircraft. Next, turn the  lights all the way up and have the student attempt to reacquire  those same outside objects. Undoubtedly, this demonstrates  the importance of dimming cockpit lights. To further the  student’s understanding, discuss that helicopters frequently  are asked to fly at night into unlit locations. The importance  of dim cockpit lighting is reinforced with this demonstration.  

It is important for the instructor to be very knowledgeable  of human factors affecting night flight. By discussing the  anatomy of the eye, for example, the instructor can stress the  importance of oxygen for night vision. Explain those factors  that deprive the eyes of oxygen, such as illness, fever, or  smoking. A new student who smokes tobacco may not see  what a nonsmoker sees at night. High altitude flights impact  night vision due to hypoxia. Because the eye uses more  oxygen than any other part of the body per weight, vision  degradation can begin at 5,000 feet pressure altitude.  

# Cross-Country Operations  

Cross-country flight training should include pilotage and dead  reckoning, radio navigation, radar services, diversions, and  disorientation procedures. These operations require a good  working knowledge of the airspace system, chart interpretation,  radio navigation, and communication. This is usually too much  to teach while in the helicopter. Therefore, a cross-country  training flight should be proceeded with one or more ground  training sessions. The regulations require night cross-country  instruction for both private and commercial applicants.  However, this should be taught only after the student is  comfortable with both night and cross-country operations.  

# Instructional Points  

Make sure your student has a good working knowledge of  the airspace system. He or she should be able to interpret  airspace boundaries from the charts, as well as understand  the operational, communication, equipment, and weather  requirements to operate within a particular airspace. The  instructor should ask the student to read the charts and maps  under the red lighting conditions found in most helicopters at  night. Using the red lens flashlight in a dark classroom can  also be a good simulation as well.  

Make sure the student has a good working knowledge of  aeronautical charts. The student must clearly understand  all symbols and markings. He or she should also be able to  read and understand topography and any potential hazards.  

Teach dead reckoning and pilotage first. This is a good  foundation for cross-country navigation without having to  rely on navigation equipment. It is equally important for the  student to learn how to operate all available navigation radios.  

It is imperative that the student demonstrate good crew  resource management. The student should consider how to  organize maps, charts, checklists and be aware of the difficulty  in using light sources. The student must be familiarized with  the locations and functions of equipment switches and dials  to preclude repeatedly looking inside to adjust these items.  

Single-pilot resource management (SRM) is an essential  element of all flights, but especially important for cross- country operations. Remind the student that at least one  hand must be on the flight controls at all times, so navigation  information, such as charts and flight logs, must be easily  accessible and ready for use. Have the student use a kneeboard  for charts, logs, and other visual aids so that everything is  accessible and in one place. See Chapter 15, Single-Pilot  Resource Management, Aeronautical Decision-Making, and  Risk Management, for a more in-depth discussion of SRM.  

# Common Student Difficulties Poor Cross-Country Planning  

A thorough understanding of the airspace system and a good  working knowledge of aviation charts are prerequisites for  any cross-country flight. If the student is lacking in any of  these areas, the result is poor cross-country planning. When  planning a flight, use checkpoints that are easily recognizable,  even if they require a little deviation from the most direct route  and remind the student that good daytime checkpoints may  not make good night time checkpoints. The differences should  be discussed with the student during flight planning. For a  beginning student, it may be advisable to skirt certain airspace  in order to reduce communication workload. As experience  increases, flight into busier airspace can be increased.  

# Reliability on Navigation Equipment  

More helicopters now have global positioning system (GPS)  navigation equipment. This equipment has a host of features,  including moving maps, airspace, and airport information.  While GPS is very useful, the beginning student must not rely  on it. A thorough knowledge and understanding of pilotage  and dead reckoning is required. If the training helicopter is  equipped with GPS or any other navigational equipment,  use it only as a backup, especially during the initial training  with the student.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 A student will attempt to imitate instructor actions.  Do not take shortcuts. Instill safety from the first day.  Insist the student follow established procedures when  performing any maneuver.  

•	 Make the training relevant to the student.  [Figure 11-12] Explain how the student will use the maneuver in  future operations.  

•	 During maneuvers that bring the helicopter in close  proximity to the ground or obstacles, instructors should  stay close to the controls but not “on the controls.”  Staying on the controls ruins the control feel for the  student and makes it more difficult for the instructor  to judge exactly what the student is doing, and may  hurt the student’s confidence to fly. It is important to  not let the helicopter depart the instructor’s comfort  zone. It does not really matter what the student is doing  as long as the helicopter stays within safe recoverable  parameters. The helicopter’s parameters and situation  are the instructor’s primary concern.  

•	 Remember, when a student encounters difficulty in  mastering an objective, find a means of allowing some  degree of success. For example, the lesson is steep  Advanced Flight Maneuvers

turns. Rather than have the student attempt the entire  maneuver, try having the student practice the entry.  When no difficulty is experienced with the entry, add  the next stage, then continue until the entire maneuver  is completed. If the student continues to have a  difficult time, it may be best to revert to the classroom  and discuss what the helicopter should be doing, what  the student should be seeing, where the student should  be looking, and what responses can be expected. If the  student cannot explain the maneuver on the ground,  they will take hours to figure it out in the air. Then,  as the instructor redemonstrates the maneuver, task  the student with talking the instructor through the  maneuver. Usually by this point, the student learns  or recognizes the missing piece, practice, procedure,  or control movement to fly the maneuver properly.  

•	 For any topic in the debriefing, where the student is  deficient, the instructor should always have the answer  for the student’s problem. It is never good enough to  simply critique the student’s performance without  explaining how to improve and correct the student’s  actions. The instructor must determine if the difficulty  is the student’s basic understanding of the maneuver,  an incorrect perception of what should be happening,  the lack of remembering to use the proper reference,  or the improper perception of which control to use  to correct the performance.  Often, the student did  not remember or learn one basic requirement. Learn  the situation through talking with the student and by  having them describe what they are trying to do. The  problems will go away as the instructor explains how  to correct or compensate for the effect.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter presented training techniques and instructional  points an instructor can use to teach advanced flight  maneuvers. Common difficulties encountered by students  when attempting to perform these maneuvers were also  discussed, as well as suggestions for instructional techniques.  

# Chapter 12 Helicopter Emergencies  

# Introduction  

Learning emergency procedures is an important component  of helicopter flight training. The instructor must ensure a  student is completely familiar with the emergency procedures  section of the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) pertinent to  the helicopter model being flown.  

Many instructors require students to memorize emergency  procedures and are satisfied when the student offers a  simple recitation of the steps outlined in a procedure. While  memorizing steps in a procedure is an important element  of acquiring knowledge, it does not supply the knowledge  needed to solve a problem or provide a solution to something  that is not covered by the newly acquired knowledge.  As discussed in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook,  understanding, or the ability to notice similarities and make  associations between the facts and procedural steps learned, is  an important next stage in the knowledge acquisition process.  

Once the student has mastered the emergency procedure, an  instructor can enhance this level of learning by creating a  scenario that leads to a malfunction the student must resolve  using emergency procedures. Proper scenario based training  requires research by the instructor to make this meaningful  to the student.  

Take time to research an accident that replicates the training  being performed. The National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) website, www.ntsb.gov, provides several links that  may be helpful.  

Once research has been completed, sit down with the student  and discuss what factors may have caused the accident. By  discussing the causes of the accident, a thorough review and  check of the student’s depth of understanding can occur. As  an example, there are many possible causes to an engine  failure. Internal engine failure, fuel starvation, contaminated  fuel, drive train failure, air inlet interruption, or hardware  failure are just some of the possible causes. Discuss in detail,  the cockpit indications that the pilot would have seen. What  instrumentation differences may have been observed? What  is the aerodynamic profile as it applies to this situation? What  actions by the pilot were necessary and were they correctly  assessed and taken?  

Follow the discussion with a training flight that allows the  student to view the gauges, indications, and flight profile that  permit the student to practically apply the lessons learned  from the scenario-based discussion. This type of training  requires the student to exhibit knowledge of aircraft systems,  as well as higher order thinking skills (HOTS).  

The outcome of any emergency that might occur in an aircraft  is directly related to the pilot’s ability to react instantly and  correctly, since there may be limited time to analyze the  problem. Although a pilot could spend an entire career in  helicopters without actually encountering an emergency  situation, the demonstrated ability to cope with any situation  is essential to safe operations and pilot confidence. Therefore,  it is necessary to introduce emergency procedures early in the  training programs and to practice them frequently.  

# Autorotative Descents  

An autorotative descent is a part of numerous emergency  procedures in helicopters. Autorotations should be introduced  first with an intentional entry so the student can practice  establishing an autorotative glide. When the student develops  proficiency in performing autorotations to a selected spot,  the instructor should initiate autorotations when the student  is not expecting them by announcing “engine failure.”  [Figure 12-1]  As the student’s ability to do an autorotation  progresses, the instructor can use scenarios like decreasing  oil pressure or zero oil pressure to stage an engine failure  scenario. This will better prepare the student for an actual  engine failure as there are usually prior indications that  occur and need to be recognized. A student who becomes  accustomed to someone announcing “engine failure” may  never learn what the prior indications of the actual failure  are. Refer the student to the Helicopter Flying Handbook and  use it as a guide for a detailed discussion of the techniques  for performing autorotative descents.  

# Straight-In Autorotation, With Instructional Points  

As the student demonstrates the ability to react properly,  the instructor should announce “engine failure” as he or she  retards the throttle to further develop the student’s reactions.  Never give the student a simulated engine failure unless an  autorotation can be made safely to the surface. Do not assume  a power recovery will prevent a landing to an unsuitable area  because the engine may hesitate or even completely shut down  when rolling off the throttle during the autorotation entry.  To prevent an inadvertent engine shutdown during practice  autorotations, follow the procedures outlined in the RFM.  

Perform practice autorotations to a known area free of  obstructions, where a safe landing to the surface can be made  at any time.  [Figure 12-2]  

![](images/a094157d33fa8ca46632e4d506006c7d2e03d44ad5f0f2994117830f6bfb363a.jpg)  
Figure 12-1.   During an autorotation, the upward flow of relative wind permits the main rotor blades to rotate at normal speed. In effect,  the blades are “gliding” in their rotational plane.

Demonstrate the maneuver using the manufacturer’s  recommended airspeeds for autorotative descent or the best  gliding speed. The instructor should require the student to  review the performance charts and know the minimum and  maximum glide airspeeds for the day’s conditions. Especially  during the early phases of training, the flights should be  conducted at higher altitudes to give the new student more  time to understand the different descent angles available,  using minimum rate of descent airspeeds and maximum glide  airspeeds. Some helicopter RFMs also advise of different rotor  rpm values for gliding descents. In those cases, substantial  care should be exercised to maintain the proper rotor rpm  for the glide and then restoring the proper rpm value for  the landing in a safe manner, even if performing a power  recovery. Emphasize coordinating the collective movement  with proper antitorque pedal for trim to prevent nose tuck.  Nose tuck mainly occurs to certain helicopters, usually those  with canted tail surfaces. Nose tuck is the rapid nose-down  pitching resulting from a yawing motion causing excessive lift  in a stabilizer. This only occurs when the stabilizer is canted  upward from the horizontal. Instruct the student to apply  cyclic control to maintain proper airspeed. After entering the  maneuver, have the student verify and call out needle split,  rotor revolutions per minute (rpm) in the green arc, helicopter  in trim, and airspeed.  

During the descent, instruct the student to adjust collective  pitch control as necessary to maintain rotor rpm. Emphasize  avoiding large collective pitch increases because they result  in a rapid decay of rotor rpm. Demonstrate how aft cyclic  movements cause a temporary increase in rotor rpm.  

At approximately 40–100 feet above the surface, or at the  altitude recommended by the manufacturer, demonstrate  the deceleration with aft cyclic control. Explain how the  deceleration is used to both reduce forward airspeed and  decrease the rate of descent. Point out that the cyclic control  is not moved rearward so abruptly as to cause the helicopter  to climb.  

Show how the helicopter is placed in the landing attitude at  approximately 8–15 feet, or the altitude recommended by  the manufacturer. Explain that extreme caution should be  used to avoid an excessive nose high and tail low attitude  below 10 feet. Demonstrate the application of collective  pitch, as necessary, to slow the descent and cushion the  landing. Explain that additional antitorque pedal is required  to maintain heading as collective pitch is raised due to the  reduction in rotor rpm and the resulting reduced effect of the  tail rotor. Emphasize touching down in a level flight attitude.  

NOTE: A power recovery can be made during training in lieu  of a full touchdown landing. (Refer to the section on power  recoveries for the correct technique.)  

After touchdown, and after the helicopter has come to a  complete stop, lower the collective pitch to the full-down  position. Discuss the hazards of using the cyclic or collective  to slow the helicopter’s ground run.  

NOTE: Numerous tail boom strikes have occurred due to  improper collective pitch response upon ground contact  and completion of the maneuver. Particular attention must  be emphasized as to the proper rate and timing of lowering  collective to avoid potential damage to aircraft components.  Emphasize the minimum requirements for rotor rpm, airspeed,  and trim conditions throughout the maneuver.  

If the instructor or the student feels uncomfortable with the  autorotation, do not hesitate to initiate a go-around. The  instructor is responsible and should terminate the maneuver  anytime the parameters vary from normal, or if either pilot  determines something is not right. These are common  comments that are submitted on accident or incident reports.  Therefore, the instructor should be especially aware of these  occurrences and err on the side of caution by making power  recoveries or go-arounds if any doubts exist. The instructor’s  primary duty is to ensure the student has safe flights and does  not get into trouble.  

The instructor should highlight the student’s understanding  of the wind’s effects as related to airspeed versus ground  speed, and the amount of flare necessary to slow for the  landing. The instructor should help the student to cope with  the increased airflow through the rotor system in the flare and  how to control rpm, both increasing and decreasing.  

The importance of landing gear alignment cannot be  overemphasized during actually touchdowns. If the helicopter  is kept in trim, the rate of descent will be the minimum rate. Out  of trim conditions increase the rates of descent considerably.  Usually, it is useful to demonstrate how much out-of-trim  conditions can increase the rate of descent. Although not  usually needed or desired, a steeper descent angle to enable  an emergency landing in a very close-in landing area could  be useful, but only if the student is trained how to recover and  arrest that increased rate of descent.  

# Autorotations With Turns, With Instructional  Points  

When autorotations are first introduced, they are usually  conducted straight ahead and into the wind. Discuss with  the student that a turn, or a series of turns, may be necessary  during an autorotation to land into the wind or avoid  obstacles. Emphasize that the turn should be completed as  soon as possible during the descent so that the remainder  of the autorotation is the same as a straight-in autorotation.  

Ensure the student is aware that, during the turn, the rotor rpm  must be closely monitored as it has a tendency to build during  the turn. Airspeed, on the other hand, may be unreliable until  the turn is completed. The importance of maintaining the  helicopter in trim cannot be overemphasized.  

Instruct the student to adjust the collective as necessary in  the turn to maintain the rotor rpm in the green arc. If the  collective pitch was increased to control the rpm, it may need  to be lowered on rollout to prevent a decay in rpm.  

During training, the turn should be completed and the  helicopter in position to land in the intended touchdown area  prior to passing through 100 feet above ground level (AGL).  Initiate an immediate power recovery if the helicopter is not  aligned with the touchdown point or if the rotor rpm and/or  airspeed are not within proper limits.  

# Power Recovery From Practice Autorotation,  With Instructional Points  

From an instructor’s point of view, it must be remembered  that a power recovery, if applied too late or too rapidly, can  result in hard landings that sever tail rotor drives (resulting  from loss of yaw control), overboosting of turbocharged  engines, overtemping and/or overtorques of turbine engines.  To avoid this from occurring, think through power application  using an early, smooth, and measured response. Do not wait  until the helicopter is on the verge of being unrecoverable to  initiate the power recovery.  

Upon initial training, explain to the student that a power  recovery is used to terminate practice autorotations or  simulated engine failures at a point prior to actual touchdown.  The power recovery itself is not an emergency procedure.  

In the event of an emergency that requires autorotation, the  student must be prepared to complete the autoroation to  touchdown.  

Emphasize the importance of the throttle detent to avoid  inadvertent shutdown. This may occur by unintentionally  closing the throttle to the off position. As the instructor, it is  your responsibility to verify the power control detent is in  the proper position when manipulating the throttle in flight.  

Additionally, stress the need to increase throttle and join the  engine and rotor tachometer needles with the collective in  the down position. The power or throttle should be increased  to engage the clutch or have the rotor and engine together  at about 100 feet AGL. If the throttle is increased too much  or too fast, an engine overspeed can occur; if the throttle is  increased too little or too slowly in proportion to the increase  in collective pitch, a loss of rotor rpm results.  

Coordinate upward collective pitch control with an increase  in the throttle to join the needles at operating rpm. Ensure  the student understands the increase of throttle and collective  pitch must be accomplished properly.  

If a power recovery is to be made, slowly increase the engine  rpm during the descent to avoid the rapid application of  throttle for the recovery.  

If the student is at all apprehensive about autorotations,  be prepared for him or her to either overcontrol or freeze  on the controls. One technique of teaching autorotations  is to use power-on glides that replicate the autorotational  profile, terminating to a hover or with a slight ground run,  if permissible. By using this technique, a new instructor can  get the feel for the power required and subsequent yaw that  occurs during the flare and landing. An instructor should  never let the student exceed aircraft limits or the instructor’s  ability to recover the helicopter.  

As a teaching technique in many helicopters, a minimum of  power can be used for the landing to offer a preview of a full  autorotative touchdown. Basically, this offers more cushion  and allows a quicker but very controlled touchdown. Having  the engine engaged prior to the flare allows the engine to  accelerate throughout the flare to produce hover power. The  instructor should remember the power recovery is actually a  very precise maneuver, requiring the most control movement  of almost any maneuver in very little time, and the student  is required to transition from power-off flight to almost  maximum power in a hover. Because so much is happening  so quickly, anything the instructor can do to allow more time  for the student to perceive all of the actions that must occur  in that brief time period gives large returns for the training.  

# Power Failure in a Hover, With Instructional  Points  

Whether instructing or evaluating, performing a power  failure at a hover is another high accident rate maneuver.  The following are some of the common mistakes made by  instructors.  

The first is site selection. Ensure the surface area is a flat,  smooth, and hard surface. Students initially tend to have  a difficult time accounting for translating tendency. This,  in turn, most often causes lateral drift. If conducting this  maneuver on a sloping surface, one or more of several  phenomena may occur, from dynamic rollover to damaged  skid gear. The same can be said for soft or uneven surfaces,  as the skid gear may stick, causing a pivot point.  

Selecting the proper entry height is also imperative. Often,  initiating this maneuver from higher than the prescribed entry  altitude may cause the student to prematurely apply collective  to arrest the rate of descent for landing, leaving the aircraft at  little or no available rpm while not yet on the ground.  

At higher entry heights, a tendency is to attempt to lower the  collective to build available inertia or keep the rotor rpm up.  Loss of power at a hover with the normal high power setting  always results in a rapid rotor rpm decay. Review of the  H/V chart almost always indicates that there is insufficient  power to allow a safe, uneventful landing if the hover height  is too high. However the student does it, if the hover height  is too high, a hard landing results from a power or driveline  failure. There simply is not enough potential energy in the  rotor system alone to cushion the landing. This should not be  shown to students as it requires a great amount of experience  and special training to accomplish successfully. Ensure the  student understands a power failure can occur at any time.  Hovering autorotations are practiced to develop the automatic  response and coordination required to maintain heading and  cushion the landing following an engine failure at a hover.  

Explain to the student that power failures at a hover may  occur during either of the two modes of flight: hovering flight  in ground effect (IGE) and hovering flight out of ground  effect (OGE). Refer to the RFM to generate discussion of  the procedures to be used for each instance.  

Stress to the student that for power failures at a hover while  IGE, the collective is not lowered, but held in place until  approximately 1 foot AGL when collective pitch is increased  to cushion the landing. Explain that when hovering OGE,  operations usually fall in the hashmarked area of the height- velocity diagram, which may require lowering the collective  and adding forward cyclic in attempt to land the helicopter.  

As previously mentioned, emphasize the importance of  minimizing sideward or rearward drift during the maneuver  to reduce the possibility of dynamic rollover or other damage  to the helicopter.  

It is best to debrief the student after each maneuver. Review  the maneuvers with the student and point out what was done  correctly, and what was not. When discussing errors, point  out to the student why they happened and what could be done  to correct or prevent them. When a student is continuously  having difficulty with a particular maneuver, the instructor  must find a way to help the student understand what is  happening. Helping the student pinpoint exactly what they  are doing wrong, and how to help the student learn to avoid  these errors is what the instructor should focus on. This  permits the student to immediately take corrective action  on the next repetition. Take time to talk about the hazards  of excessive nose low takeoffs, exposure to the hazard area  of the height/velocity chart, and the dangers of dynamic  rollover. Discussing these hazards while performing this  maneuver reinforces the need to carefully choose correct  flight techniques and profiles.  

# Common Student Difficulties With Autorotation  

Students have a tendency to look straight down in front of the  aircraft while performing an autorotation. By focusing straight  down or on the intended touchdown point, the student loses  the ability to determine altitudes. Also, students fail to check  trim, rotor rpm, and airspeed, and fail to completely close  or place the throttle in the ground idle or override position.  

Autorotation is overwhelming the first few times students  perform it and can almost put them into a “frozen state” of  mind. Rather than looking at all the instruments, flight gages,  and directing what flight path the helicopter should be going,  they become fixated with the ground and focus only on that.  Once the autorotation has been initiated, immediately have  the student verbally call out what they should be looking at.  For example, have the student say “Rotors are at 100 percent,  NG is stabilized, airspeed is at 60 knots and the aircraft is in  trim.” At first, the student is just rehearsing aloud but after  doing more and more autorotations and training them to look  at the instruments, gauges, and attitude of the helicopter each  time with verbal cues help them remain focused on what is  important, landing the helicopter safely.  

# Emergency Situations for Discussion Only  

There are a few situations unique to helicopter operations  that must be understood if they are to be avoided. Some of  these emergencies may only be discussed, not demonstrated,  because demonstration would probably result in damage to  the helicopter. They are included here to remind the instructor  to make sure the student is able to discuss the problems and  how they can be avoided.  

# Vortex Ring State (Settling With Power)  

NOTE: Vortex ring state (settling with power) is not a  discussion only maneuver in a single-rotor helicopter. It  can safely be introduced and practiced at altitudes allowing  distance to recover. However, settling with power should not  be practiced in twin-rotor helicopters due to excessive roll  or pitch rates that occur when one rotor is in the vortex ring  state and the other is in relatively more stable air. Coaxial  and intermeshing main rotor system helicopters should be  safe for settling with power practices.  

Ensure the student understands that settling with power can  occur as a result of attempting to descend at an excessively  low airspeed in a downwind condition, or by attempting to  hover OGE at a weight and density altitude greater than the  helicopter’s performance allows.  [Figure 12-3]  

![](images/f8451066abd081f18a8d7ff4f2cb29bfa9aea72918bdedc90bb8a7667ae6b000.jpg)  
Figure 12-3.   Vortex ring state.  

As is always the case, using a scenario that the student finds  applicable to his or her future helicopter career is most  beneficial. An ideal scenario-type discussion for this can be a  confined area approach (in which the winds were incorrectly  judged, resulting in a downwind approach) or a job-specific  OGE hover-type maneuver (long line, filming for news crews,  search-and-rescue hoist operations, external load hookup/ release, etc.,) that puts the helicopter in the required settling  with power profile.  

While common thought is to lower the collective and fly out  of the downwash, this may not be the best option due to lower  altitudes or obstacles. Through discussion of aerodynamic  theory, an option of laterally exiting the ‘disturbed air’ can be  the best option available. In a counterrotating system, lateral  flight to the right often results in the quickest exit from the  airflow and affords the pilot the best view of the exit route.  The lateral travel is enhanced by the thrust from the tail rotor  and introduces turbulent free air sooner to the tail rotor than  any other direction.  

Adding collective while the helicopter is descending  vertically only aggravates the situation. Settling with power  can occur only if the rotor is powered. A demonstration of  settling with power may be required of the applicant for a  commercial helicopter rating. The private pilot applicant  may be required only to discuss recognition and avoidance,  but should have a demonstration of settling with power to  understand its effects better.  

The demonstration should begin at an altitude high enough  above the ground to allow room for safe recovery. Entry into  the condition can be made from the events as described in the  scenario, if acceptable. Another set of circumstances causing  entry into the vortex ring state is a decelerating airspeed  descent, such as that experienced with a high, steep, downwind  approach. This can be used to show the student a probable or  likely result of poor or rushed planning.  

The student should be reminded that settling with power  always requires three conditions to occur:  

1.	 Rate of descent greater than 300 fpm 2.	 Airspeed less than 10 knots in any direction 3.	 More than 20 percent of engine power applied to the  rotor system  

By taking away any one of the three conditions, settling with  power should not occur. Therefore, the instructor can remind  the student to keep the descents slow and less than   $300\,\mathrm{fpm}$  ;  keep the helicopter moving into the wind, which normally  maintains good airflow at the 10 knot or higher value; and,  if altitude allows, reduce the collective to reduce power  entering the rotor system. In most instances, a lateral maneuver  produces the quickest exit from the disturbed column of air.  

When simulating an attempt to hover OGE, the airspeed is  gradually slowed and power is added to maintain altitude. Care  must be taken to avoid any rearward speed. If the helicopter  can hover OGE, it may be necessary to reduce power to begin  settling, then add power to increase rotor downwash. As soon  as the effects of settling with power are noticeable, recovery  should be initiated. The noticeable effects are vibration,  reduced control effectiveness, and a high rate of descent.  

Recovery is accomplished by either laterally exiting the  disturbed wind or, if altitude allows, reducing collective and  lowering the nose to increase forward speed. This moves a  helicopter out of its downwash and into translational lift.  

When the helicopter is clear of the disturbed air, or downwash,  confirm a forward speed indication and initiate a climb to  regain the lost altitude.  

# Retreating Blade Stall  

The student must understand the limits of high speed in  the helicopter and the reasons for imposing them. While  structural and airframe design limit helicopter airspeed,  the most frequently referenced aerodynamic limitation to  helicopter airspeed is retreating blade stall.  

The symptoms of retreating blade stall are main rotor  vibrations, nose pitch up, and a rolling tendency, usually  to the left in a helicopter with a counterclockwise main  rotor blade rotation. High gross weight, maneuvering, and  turbulence all tend to aggravate the retreating blade stall  condition.  

Retreating blade stall normally cannot be demonstrated  without exceeding the never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$   or  maneuvering limits of the helicopter. However, the student  must be able to explain that the cause of retreating blade stall  is excessive forward speed for the existing circumstances.  The manufacturer’s recommended  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   provides protection  for normal situations. If the helicopter is heavily loaded  and then flown into turbulence at or near   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  , or if it is  maneuvered abruptly, retreating blade stall can occur. Ensure  the student becomes familiar with the procedure (lower the  collective, increase rpm, if possible, and reduce speed) for  recovery from retreating blade.  

The instructor should advise the student that retreating blade  stall is only one of many factors that produce the limiting   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   in coaxial and close tandem rotor systems, such as the  Kaman K-Max,  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   may not be characterized as retreating  blade stall due to the counterrotating blade system. This  design may mask the huge stresses on the rotor system until  the stresses overcome the structure. The instructor should  ensure the student abides by all limitations.  

When corrective action is introduced at the first vibration  indicating retreating blade stall, there should be very little  effect. If the blade stall is allowed to progress to the point the  helicopter pitches up and rolls, trying to stop the pitch and roll  with cyclic inputs only aggravates the situation. Allowing a  helicopter to pitch up reduces speed and alleviates the blade  stall condition. Roll control is then effective. The best way to  prevent students from encountering retreating blade stall is to  instill in them the practice of flying at air speeds below  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  .  The margin should be increased if turbulence is encountered.  

Emphasize to the student that retreating blade stall can be  avoided by adhering to the  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  . The decrease in  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   speed  with increasing density altitude must also be explained  thoroughly.  

# Ground Resonance  

Ground resonance is a hazard associated with an articulated  rotor system. Have the student explain which types of rotor  systems are susceptible to ground resonance, the factors that  tend to cause it, and the means to avoid it or recover from it if  it occurs. The student must understand that if the helicopter is  allowed to touch down in a manner that creates a jolt or bounce  to the airframe, ground resonance can occur. Improperly  serviced landing gear struts in some helicopters can aggravate  the tendency to oscillate and contribute to ground resonance.  This contact with the ground sends vibrations through the  aircraft to the rotor system, causing an imbalance and center  of gravity shift in the rotor system. The imbalanced rotor  system energy is transferred, in the form of a rhythmic  back and forth vibration (normally a lateral, or side to side,  motion), from the surface to the rotor system. Although the  frequency of this vibration remains constant, the strength of  the vibration is amplified until an uncontrollable oscillation  develops.  [Figure 12-4]  

![](images/7ed6e75a8cf698176c9f24fa33b3db66b4b47b98a7a3f68582759782cfeaa8f0.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.   Ground resonance.  

Since the skids or landing gear wheels contacting the ground  cause the rotor to become unbalanced, the obvious means of  fixing the situation is to lift the helicopter free of the ground  and allow the blades to assume a balanced condition. If  rpm is too low for flight, the next best corrective action is  to lower the collective to place the blades in low pitch and  reduce powerplant to idle or cutoff. The vibration increases in  severity only if there is power applied to the system. Simply  lowering the collective is not sufficient to stop the destruction;  power must be removed.  

# Dynamic Rollover  

Dynamic rollover is another potentially hazardous situation  peculiar to helicopter operation. The student should be able to  explain that, for dynamic rollover to occur, some factor must  first cause a helicopter to roll and pivot around the skid or  landing gear wheel, until its critical rollover angle is reached.  Beyond this point, main rotor thrust contributes to the roll  and recovery becomes impossible, regardless of any cyclic  corrections made. Tell the student that dynamic rollover can  occur on a flat surface and most often does due to obstructions  such as tiedowns, hot asphalt, and frozen or deep mud.  

Once the helicopter reaches an angle such that the cyclic  cannot keep the rotor system level with the horizon, it is  subject to uncontrollable rolling. It is this horizontal thrust  component that makes this effect dynamic. Helicopters tend to  be top heavy and easily disturbed in the vertical mode. All of  the heavy components, such as engines, transmissions, drive  shafts and bearing mounts, tail rotor gearbox, rotor head,  swashplates, and blades are mounted high in the airframe in  most helicopters. This contributes to a very delicate balance  above what can be relatively narrow landing gear. The only  possible recovery action is to lower the collective. If the static  balance point has not been passed and the roll rate is low,  the helicopter might land back roughly on its landing gear.  

An easy but dramatic demonstration of dynamic rollover can  be illustrated by having the student stand straight with his  or her feet shoulder width apart and then gradually lean to  the side until his or her body extends past his or her center  of gravity. At this point, the student will lose balance and  will be unable to straighten up. This exercise demonstrates  to the student that once the center of gravity of the human  body extends too far in any direction, the person topples. The  same principle holds true for the helicopter.  

Point out the factors that influence dynamic rollover to  include a skid or landing gear wheel in contact with the  landing surface, pedal inputs, lateral loading (asymmetrical  loading), crosswind condition, and a high roll rate. Explain  that smooth and moderate control inputs are most effective  in preventing dynamic rollover as it reduces the rate at which  lift/thrust is introduced.  

Thorough preflights ensure the landing gear is fully free,  prudent control movements slowly lift the helicopter off the  surface or land without any lateral motion. The rising of one  side of the helicopter for compensation for the translating  effect should be expected and countered. More or less tilt  than normal or usual is reason enough to stop the motion and  check for control response. If in doubt, set the helicopter back  down and double check for obstructions and skids stuck in hot  asphalt, tie down chains or ropes over skids or gear points, etc.  

While landing the helicopter, the pilot should feel for any  sliding or sinking motions, signaling an unsafe landing  surface. If such a surface is encountered, descent must be  stopped by increasing collective. If after coming to a level  attitude, no further attempts should be made to touch down,  the helicopter should be repositioned to a different area for  another landing attempt.  

# Low-G Conditions and Mast Bumping  

A student pilot must understand the potentially hazardous  implications of intentionally or inadvertently performing  low-G maneuvers. Too often, students study topics but fail  to correlate their impact on the aircraft. Low-G maneuvers  and the resulting consequences of mast bumping must be  thoroughly addressed. Explain to the student that abruptly  pushing the cyclic control forward from either straight-and- level flight or after a climb can put the helicopter into a low-G  (weightless) flight condition, with catastrophic results.  

The student must be reminded that the semirigid rotor  system suspends the airframe below the rotor. Therefore, in  normal flight, the helicopter is using the pull of gravity for  a normal airframe/rotor relationship or normal load on the  rotor system. In a low-G maneuver, with the helicopter in an  excessively nose-low or tilted attitude, gravity is no longer  pulling the airframe down, and the feeling of weightlessness  is experienced. With negligible gravitational pull between  the rotor and airframe, any cyclic control input tends to fly  the rotor disk over. The airframe does not respond, resulting  in mast bumping.  

Ensure the student understands what is happening and that  improper corrective action can lead to mast bumping or may  allow a blade to contact the airframe.  [Figure 12-5]  Since a  low-G condition could have disastrous results, it cannot be  demonstrated, but the student must learn the correct response.  The other part of the Low-G effect is the thrust of the tail  rotor being above the center of gravity. This is often the initial  cause of the fuselage to roll. Stress that abrupt movement of  the cyclic and collective should be avoided, but if the student  

![](images/c59e67cf8c26185beca0c29f4881c3a6d4b8caaebc0900f29a0c532b5340a3ba.jpg)  
Figure 12-5.   Result of improper corrective in a low-G condition.  

gets into a low-G condition, (be sure to describe the feeling of  weightlessness and an uncontrolled roll to the right), he or she  should immediately and smoothly apply aft cyclic. Warn the  student against trying to correct the rolling action with lateral  cyclic. Explain that by applying aft cyclic, lift is redirected to  counteract weight and gravity restores the balance of forces.  This in turn requires antitorque so the tail rotor forces then  become balanced as well. Unless the collective is lowered, the  thrust never changes. Only the direction of the rotor system  thrust and lift is affected. Prevention is the only proper cure  for the hazard.  

Since the best way to prevent low-G conditions is to avoid  the conditions in which they might occur, suggest the student  avoid turbulence as much as possible (since this type of  weather induces low-G conditions). If the student encounters  turbulence, advise him or her to slow forward airspeed and  make small control inputs. If turbulence becomes excessive,  explain that a precautionary landing should be considered. To  help prevent turbulence induced inputs, demonstrate how to  properly support the cyclic arm by bracing it against the leg.  

# Low Rotor RPM  

Although rotor rpm and airspeed are repeatedly emphasized  during training, it is important for the student to understand  not only that there are limits to both, but also why those  limits have been specifically defined. Ensure the student  understands and can explain that the limits for powered  operation are dictated by the operating limits of the engine.  At low rpm, the engine cannot develop full power, and the  high limit is imposed by engine structural limits. Also, point  out that if the engine and main rotor rpm are allowed to get  too low, tail rotor rpm is also greatly reduced. This situation  could lead to an inability to keep the helicopter from turning.  At the low limit on the rotor tachometer, the rotor may not  produce enough lift to sustain level flight. The high limit of  rotor rpm is imposed to protect the structural integrity of the  rotor and drive components.  

# Blade Stall  

Impress on the student that low rotor rpm can also lead to  blade stall. If the rotor rpm decays to the point at which all  the rotor blades stall, the result is usually fatal, especially  when it occurs at altitude. In addition to the main rotor blades  stalling, if centrifugal force is decreased too much, there is  not sufficient force to keep the blades horizontal. Explain that,  even at normal operating rpm, the blades cone upward when  producing lift. If the required lift remains high coupled with  high angles of attack, the blades bend upward further until  there is no recovery. The danger of low rotor rpm and blade  stall is greatest in small helicopters with low blade inertia.  Explain to the student that a pilot can create the situation in a  number of ways, such as simply rolling the throttle the wrong  way, or pulling more collective pitch than power available,  or when operating at high density altitude.  

Point out to the student that when the rotor rpm drops, the  blades tend to maintain the same amount of lift by increasing  pitch. As the pitch increases, drag increases, which requires  more power to keep the blades turning at the proper rpm.  When power is no longer available to maintain rpm, and  therefore lift, the helicopter begins to descend. This changes  the relative wind and further increases the angle of attack.  At some point, the blades stall unless rpm is restored. If all  blades stall, it is almost impossible to get smoother air flowing  across the blades.  

To make matters worse, the main rotor rpm to tail rotor rpm  ratio is one to six. Therefore, a one percent reduction in main  rotor rpm can also result in a six percent reduction in tail rotor  rpm, which corresponds directly to a loss of antitorque thrust  available and loss of yaw control.  

Stress that any time the rotor rpm falls below the rpm  limits while power is still available, the student should  simultaneously add throttle and lower the collective. If in  forward flight, gently applying aft cyclic loads up the system  and helps increase rotor rpm. If there is no power available,  immediately lower the collective and apply aft cyclic.  

# Recovery From Low Rotor RPM  

Before the student is allowed to solo, the techniques for  recovery from low rotor rpm in both a hover and in flight  must be practiced. This low rotor training should not exceed  any limitations. The instructor should not place undue stress  on the dynamic parts of the helicopter, as letting the rpm  drop too low can result in excessive blade bending, internal  engine stress (including localized overheating not monitored  by a gauge or sensor), and blade stop pounding. While in a  hover, rotor rpm is reduced until the throttle alone will not  increase the rpm. The student should then take the controls  and attempt to recover rpm by lowering the collective just  enough to allow the helicopter to settle gently toward the  ground while increasing the throttle. The objective is to  regain rpm without allowing the helicopter to touch down. To  prevent touchdown, the collective should be raised slightly to  stop the rate of descent. Practicing this maneuver graphically  demonstrates to the student that if rotor speed is lost and the  helicopter begins to settle, collective pitch alone should not be  increased in an attempt to maintain altitude. While in flight,  rpm may be regained by lowering the collective slightly and  increasing the rpm. Aft cyclic while lowering the collective  may also help increase rotor rpm, but is usually not required  unless the rpm is critically low.  

Under certain conditions of high weight, high temperature,  or high density altitude, a situation might exist in which the  rpm is low even though maximum throttle is being used.  This is usually the result of the main rotor blades having an  angle of attack that creates so much drag that engine power  is not sufficient to maintain or attain normal operating rpm.  

In a low rpm situation, the lifting power of the main rotor  blades can be greatly diminished. Therefore, as soon as a  low rpm condition is detected, immediately apply additional  throttle, if available, while lowering the collective. This  reduces main rotor pitch and drag. Under training conditions,  make sure the skids or landing gear wheels do not contact the  ground. In an actual situation in which the engine does not  have sufficient power to accelerate the rotor, smoothly lower  the helicopter to the ground, if conditions permit. Once on the  ground, the collective can be lowered a little more to regain  rpm. Do not try to maintain a hover by raising the collective  when the rpm is too low and the throttle is wide open.  

As the helicopter begins to settle, smoothly raise the collective  to stop the descent. At hovering altitude, this procedure might  need to be repeated several times to regain normal operating  rpm. This technique is called “milking the collective.”  

When operating at altitude, the collective may need to  be lowered only once to regain rotor speed. The amount  collective can be lowered depends on altitude.  

Since the tail rotor is geared to the main rotor, low main rotor  rpm may prevent the tail rotor from producing enough thrust  to maintain directional control. If pedal control is lost and the  altitude is low enough that a landing can be accomplished  before the turning rate increases dangerously, slowly decrease  collective pitch, maintain a level altitude with cyclic control,  and land.  

As instructors, we are aware that in most modern helicopters  low or inadequate rotor rpm is an indicator of probable  overloading or engine performance problems. Show the  student that increased awareness to higher density altitudes  is critical. Have the student determine the density altitude at  the time this maneuver is performed and note to the student  that recoveries at higher altitudes may not be possible.  

# Common Student Difficulties  

As the helicopter begins to settle, students may have a  tendency to increase collective pitch to stop the descent.  Remember, students often fail to correlate the requirement  to reduce collective pitch and increase throttle because  previous training emphasized reducing throttle when  lowering collective.  

# Brownout/Whiteout  

Brownout and whiteout are two more helicopter hazards that  cannot be demonstrated, but should be discussed with the  student. Stress that the helicopter’s capability of landing in  many conditions make it susceptible to visual obscuration  when flying over ground material that can be blown up into  the rotors during hover flight at low altitude. Differentiate  between the brownout caused by dust and sand and the  whiteout experienced in snow conditions.  

If during normal training sessions, seasonal conditions  warrant the need to encounter such conditions, use the time  to discuss the proper actions, taking care not to expose the  student to an unfamiliar environment. Most often, an approach  to the ground will suffice to compensate for these conditions.  

It should be noted that brownout conditions occur to varying  degrees for a given landing zone depending on the aircraft in  use (single versus tandem rotor), its configuration (weight),  tactics being employed (rapidity of approach and landing,  accompanying aircraft, time on deck, etc.), and environmental  conditions (humidity and/or rain, day versus night, and  temperature and density altitude). In general, explain that  helicopters tend to begin to experience brownout during an  angled, no-hover approach to landing at approximately 1–2  rotor diameters above ground level (50–150 feet), with the  most serious conditions being experienced at approximately  50 feet and below. As the aircraft slows, the thrust vector  of the main rotor disk becomes more vertical (as the aircraft  pitches its nose up to decelerate), and the thrust becomes  greater as power is added to sustain a hover, or near-hover  condition prior to landing. Also, the rotor thrust tends to  circulate down, out, then back up and down again through  the rotor disk just prior to touchdown. All of these conditions  combine just prior to landing, the most critical time for the  pilot to eliminate lateral drift.  

With the helicopter engulfed in the cloud of a suspended  particulate material, the pilot loses outside reference and  horizon cues. The instructor should stress that the loss of  pilot visual reference to a fixed point inevitably causes some  degree of unintended pilot or aircraft-induced drift away  from the intended line of approach and landing. Discuss  how, given the top-heavy nature of most helicopters and the  aerodynamics of their rotor disks, landing with lateral drift  of any kind can cause the aircraft to be damaged, or to roll  over, particularly if combined with a pivot point (such as a  rock, or rut) upon touchdown. Emphasize the importance of  avoiding sideways motion, which can lead to dynamic roll.  

While the majority of mishaps related to brownout conditions  occur during landings, advise the student that a helicopter  takeoff may also cause brownout due to rotor wash. Ask the  student to explain why it is less problematic during takeoff.  The student should explain that the aircraft is accelerating  away from the dust, and lateral drift is less of a safety factor,  except for obstructions in close proximity to the line of  departure. The pilot is able to set a power and nose attitude  and fly the aircraft safely out of a zone, and not be overly  concerned with induced drift due to restricted visibility. A  maximum performance takeoff should be used when taking  off from a possible brownout/whiteout condition to ensure the  quickest exit possible. If the surface is sand or snow covered,  planning for an approach to the surface and being slightly  faster than normal should help the pilot avoid a brown or  white out. Likewise, the takeoff in a possible white or brown  out condition should be from the surface and not from a hover  in order to exit the condition before the horizon is completely  obscured. Highlight the need to first check the helicopter for  clearance from the surface by bringing it light on the skids  or skis to ensure power is good, controls are normal, and  the landing gear is free, then reducing power to allow the  air to clear before the actual takeoff. The standard 40-knot  takeoff attitude is very important to heed to stay ahead of  the majority of the cloud dust/snow cloud that is generated  by the rotor system and maximum power to climb out of the  surface obscuration as soon as possible. Instructors should  note the experience level of the students being flown. Do  not use instrument flight terms with students who have yet  to conduct instrument flight training.  

# System or Equipment Malfunctions  

# Antitorque System Failure  

NOTE: Many helicopters have antitorque failure procedures  that can be safely practiced and will most likely terminate  the landing with some sort of  run on landing.  

An antitorque failure can occur in several different forms.  Impress upon the student the necessity to become familiar  with each type of failure, its effects on flight, and the  manufacturer’s recommended procedure for coping with  the malfunction. A discussion of some of the types of  malfunctions, as well as probable effects and corrective  actions, should be included in any training syllabus.  

The instructor should also include discussion on the effects of  structural design and components. The vertical stabilator, for  example, provides a streamlining or trim effect under certain  conditions and airspeeds. At what speeds will the vertical  fin be most effective, and does that correlate to touchdown  airspeed for the respective RFM procedure? An instructor’s  role is greater than regurgitating already printed information.  Go beyond the print and incorporate aircraft specifics and  procedures to probable conditions that will help the student  obtain a higher level of understanding.  

# Complete Loss of Tail Rotor Thrust  

Ensure the student understands that complete loss of tail  rotor thrust involves a break in the drive system, and pedal  input will have no effect on helicopter trim. The tail rotor is  providing no thrust to compensate for torque.  

# Fixed Pitch Settings  

Explain to the student that a fixed pitch setting is dependent  upon the amount of power applied at the time of the  malfunction. If the failure occurs at a reduced power setting  (low torque), the helicopter’s nose will turn when power  is applied. When the failure occurs at an increased power  setting (high torque), the nose of the helicopter will turn when  power is reduced. Emphasize the use of the manufacturer’s  recommended procedures for coping with either situation.  

# Loss of Tail Rotor Components  

Make the student aware that if the loss of tail rotor components  occurs, he or she will also experience a shift in the center of  gravity. The student should understand that the severity of the  situation is dependent upon the amount of weight lost. Impress  upon the student that if a major failure allows something  like the drive to begin whipping around, it could destroy the  entire tail boom. Extended flight is not recommended after a  failure of any kind. The helicopter can be repaired at a remote  landing area much more quickly and at a much lower cost  than rebuilding the helicopter after a crash landing 3 miles  closer to the base of operations. If something on a helicopter  fails, follow the RFM procedures. If there is any suspicion of  a component failure, safely land as soon as possible.  

# Unanticipated Yaw/Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness  (LTE)  

Loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), or unanticipated yaw,  is not related to equipment malfunction, but rather is a result  of the tail rotor not providing the adequate thrust required  to maintain directional control. LTE may occur at airspeeds  less than 30 knots and can be caused by a number of factors,  including main rotor disk interference, weathercock stability,  and tail rotor vortex ring state. It also depends upon wind  direction and speed, altitude, and helicopter design. Thus, LTE  offers a number of opportunities for the instructor to discuss  the principles of aerodynamics and the physics involved in  helicopter flight while reviewing a helicopter hazard.  

To help reduce the onset of LTE, make sure the student  understands the limitations of the training helicopter and  those circumstances under which LTE is most likely to occur.  Additionally, discuss recovery procedures (forward flight into  the wind is best, but it must be in an obstacle-free direction,  not downwind) and the effects of altitude and terrain on the  recovery procedure.  

# Main Drive Shaft Failure  

Failure of the main drive shaft causes an immediate increase  in engine rpm and a decrease in rotor rpm. Explain to the  student that an autorotation is necessary to maintain rotor  rpm. Engine rpm should be kept within normal limits to  provide power to the tail rotor for directional control if  necessary for that helicopter.  

If the drive system is like that of a Robinson-44, then the  engine should be shutdown to minimize damage and heat  sources. If the main drive shaft of a BH 206 failed, then  the engine would be necessary to power the tail rotor for  landing from an autorotation. Until the drive shaft separates  from a turning drive, it generates a lot of noise and can cause  much damage to structures. The pilot may be told to ignore  the noise, autorotate with the rotor tachometer in the green  range, and execute an autorotative landing. Once safely on  the ground, perform an emergency engine shutdown and kill  all electrical circuits in accordance with the RFM.  

# Hydraulic Failure  

Explain to the student that the effect of hydraulic failure on  the control system in a helicopter depends on the model.  Since the hydraulic system is used to overcome high control  forces, point out to the student that the first sign of a hydraulic  failure is generally a need for more force to control helicopter  movement. In those helicopters in which control forces are  so high they cannot be moved without hydraulic assistance,  two or more independent hydraulic systems may be installed.  Have the student consult the RFM for the helicopter being  flown and then discuss the corrective actions required.  

Instructors must be most diligent when conducting hydraulic  failure training. Some accidents have occurred due to  instructors improperly or erroneously following procedures.  Discuss with the student the events that will occur before  practicing any emergency training. Always have complete  understanding, as a crew, of what steps are taken and in  what sequence.  

In helicopters equipped with dual hydraulic systems, the  instructor should ensure the student understands the purpose  of the backup system, which is to get the helicopter on the  surface and not continue the flight. The student should be  taught the common parts of the systems, such as a common  reservoir or drive pad, and how one failure can lead to failure  of the other system. The student must realize there is complete  lack of control if the remaining system fails.  

# Governor Failure  

Many training helicopters and all turbine-powered helicopters  are equipped with engine governors. It is valuable training for  the student to learn how to manually control the throttle in the  event of a governor failure. In some helicopters, the governor  can be safely turned off for training purposes. Consult the  RFM for correct procedures and techniques.  

# Multiengine Operations With One Engine  Inoperative  

Helicopters with two engines are rarely found in the training  fleet; however, instructors may transition helicopter pilots  into these more advanced aircraft. The advantages of having  two engines are obvious, not only in the redundancy of  the engines but also in the power available when both are  operating. Students should understand that, in the event of  an engine failure, there is still one engine operating and the  helicopter is still capable of flight although performance is  diminished. The RFM outlines single-engine operations and  capabilities for multiengine helicopters.  

While unlikely, dual engine failure is possible and has  occurred. Circumstances such as, icing, fuel system problems,  contamination, or drive train failure are just a few examples  that may lead to loss of powered flight in multiengine  helicopters. When conducting multiengine transitions,  training one engine inoperative emergency flight consumes  the bulk of training hours. However, ensure adequate time  is allocated to loss of powered flight in dual engine aircraft.  

# Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

Ensure the student is familiar with the location and operation  of all emergency equipment and survival gear installed or  carried in the helicopter.  Figure 12-6  shows an example of  a typical survival gear and emergency equipment list for a  wooded or densely forested location. Students should also be  shown sample lists of survival gear for all weather extremes,  such as Alaska and Arizona requirements. In a survival  situation you can never have too much equipment. Students  should receive instruction on and be familiar with the function  of emergency releases of all doors, hatches, and windows, as  well as operation of all items contained in the list.  

Discuss emergency egress and basic survival requirements  for the locale and time of year.  

While the intent of this chapter is to discuss instructional  points for emergency procedures, it cannot begin to address  all emergency equipment and survival gear required for  the many different geographical locations and aircraft- specific procedures that instructors may be faced with while  conducting training. Therefore, it is important that instructors  discuss emergency equipment and survival gear unique to the  

![](images/b5b3ad66c5c5ce0cb8987fb663f9ae330cec1a15ec91af0654b017cee55a7d22.jpg)  

geographical location and installed on the training helicopter  being flown.  

Also, discuss the requirements of Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) that apply to the equipment  carried on board for the type and area of operation. For  instance, 14 CFR part 91, section 91.205(b)(12), states, “For  VFR flight during the day, the following instruments and  equipment are required: If the aircraft is operated for hire  over water and beyond power-off gliding distance from shore,  approved flotation gear readily available to each occupant  and, unless the aircraft is operating under part 121 of this  subchapter, at least one pyrotechnic signaling device. As used  in this section, ‘shore’ means that area of the land adjacent to  the water which is above the high water mark and excludes  land areas which are intermittently under water.”  

For example, if you are located near a large body of water,  expand beyond the required syllabus to discuss what unique  characteristics and limitations are present when flotation  devices are installed. What impact could they have upon  exiting the helicopter?  

Talk about the emergency procedure required for ditching  in water. Discuss when to remove the doors in situations  of power off (autorotations) or power on (ditching). When  forced to land in water, taking the doors off is critical;  however, if the helicopter is in an autorotational descent,  removing the doors in descent may cause greater problems.  If under powered flight and forced to ditch (with little fuel  remaining), jettisoning the doors and then hovering a safe  distance away to enter the water is the best option. It is  important to discuss the danger of turning rotor blades to those  exiting the helicopter and to discuss the best manner to exit.  

Again, tailor this topic to the equipment and gear installed and  used in the training helicopter. This discussion can be quite  in depth and should be based on local procedures, as well as  the knowledge of more experienced pilots in the flight area.  

# Scenario-Based Training  

Once the student has mastered engine failure in the hover  emergency procedures, this emergency can be incorporated  into any scenario by the instructor giving a verbal warning at  the appropriate time to indicate the engine has failed.  

For an instructor, the initial focus of emergency training  is to have the student correctly analyze the malfunction  and properly perform the corrective action. This is often  accomplished with one specific emergency procedure being  taught as the center of attention. But how do we know if the  student will be able to perform this action if it actually occurs?  An instructor should never let the student exceed aircraft  limits or the instructor’s ability to recover the helicopter.  

One way to check the student’s proficiency and confidence is  to build emergency training into a routine flight scenario. Give  the student the task of planning and executing a flight to a  nearby airport. The instructor will have a predetermined series  of simulated emergencies to be given at different segments of  the flight. This allows the instructor to plan ahead to ensure  the specific procedure to be performed will be in an adequate  or approved emergency procedure training environment.  

For example, one task to be evaluated is antitorque failure.  Prior to entering the nearby airport’s traffic pattern, the  instructor gives the student a verbal description of antitorque  controllability issues and fixes the pedals. Another example  would be to advise the student that the oil pressure is low  or the engine temperature is too high. The instructor could  announce that the engine is running rough or is cutting out.  Simply saying “engine failure” is counterproductive because  the student must learn the signs of an engine failure and not  be trained to wait for cues from the instructor. The whole  intent of the training is for the pilot to be fully trained and self- sufficient in single-pilot helicopters. At this point, allow the  student to work through the situation and take the appropriate  actions. If appropriate actions are proficiently executed, the  student’s confidence level rises and the instructor also feels  secure in the student’s abilities.  

# Instructor Tips  

By using simulation or flight training programs, the student  experiences the virtual reality of various helicopter hazards,  especially ones that cannot be demonstrated due to possible  structural damage to the aircraft. Refer to  Figure 12-7  for a  general lesson plan to be used to help outline training.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter addressed various emergency procedures and  provided the instructor with some topics for discussion  with a student. Emergencies were discussed in general  terms; this chapter is not intended to replace the procedures  recommended by the manufacturer in the RFM.  

Helicopter Emergencies  

# Objective  

The purpose of this lesson is to teach the student how to land safely following an engine failure at the hover or hover taxi. Engines can fail just as easily at the hover or hover taxi as in flight. The helicopter will land very quickly should  this happen, and it is vital that a pilot be able to react quickly and prevent an incident from becoming an expensive  accident. The student will demonstrate the ability to land safely following an engine failure at the hover or hover taxi.  

# Content  

1. Preflight Discussion a. Discuss lesson objective and completion standards. b. Review hovering, take-off and landing procedures. c. Review normal checklist procedures. d. Weather analysis. e. Point out that at normal hover or hover-taxi heights, it is not possible for the student to flare. In fact, lowering the    collective following an engine failure may result in a hard landing. The pilot relies on the inertia in the rotor system    to land safely. Review height/velocity chart and discuss shaded areas to emphasize profiles at which successful    autorotations can be accomplished. f.  Describe the reaction of the helicopter when the engine fails: yaw, drift, and sink. g. Explain that the yaw and drift must be corrected before touchdown. Sink should be controlled by use of the    collective, as appropriate to the type of helicopter and the height above ground, to cushion the landing. h. Explain that, should engine failure occur at the hover-taxi, the student should avoid any rearward movement of     the cyclic and complete a run-on landing. Review dynamic rollover and the importance of minimizing lateral drift.

         Re-emphasize the concern of collective pitch being rapidly reduced prior to airframe motion coming to a complete

         stop. Failure to do so may potentially result in aircraft damage. i.  Have the student explain what is to be done and highlight the major points of the maneuvers.  

# 2. Instructor Actions  

a. Select a suitable area for practice.  b. Demonstrate into wind as follows:   1) Give a verbal warning. 2) Close the throttle. 3) Counteract yaw and drift. 4) Cushion the landing.  

3. Student Practice

   After being given a verbal warning by the instructor, the student performs the procedures for an engine failure at 

   a hover or hover taxi.  

#  

a. This exercise should be introduced by providing the student with plenty of warning before each practice. The    pace of the maneuver can then be increased to flight test standards where the student is given minimal or no    warning of the practice engine failure. b. Closing the throttle and cushioning the landing with the collective takes a good deal of manual dexterity in most    helicopters. Since the aim of this exercise is for the student to react to an engine failure, the instructor should    control the throttle in the beginning. c. Always ensure that the surface is suitable for this exercise, particularly after precipitation. d. This is a good exercise to demonstrate to the student the landing stage of an autorotation. It is a good skill to    practice just before starting a full-on autorotation exercise. e. Exercise caution because a student may react to a simulated engine failure by rapidly lowering the collective.    Be sure to give a verbal warning before closing the throttle. f. The demonstration of this exercise is easily split to show the three control movements separately. Perform three    separate demonstrations, letting the student focus each time on an individual control movement, then combine    all three before student practice.   • Always ensure that the engine is reduced to the detent so power does not increase as collective is being pulled.   • Always ensure that there is no lateral travel at touchdown during a hovering autorotation.    • Always maintain landing gear alignment with the direction of travel.  

# Postflight Discussion  

Review and critique the flight, being sure to discuss student strengths and weaknesses. Remember to provide  suggestions on how to improve performance. Preview and assign the next lesson. Assign  Helicopter Flying  Handbook , Chapter 12, Attitude Instrument Flying.  

# Chapter 13  

# Attitude Instrument Flying  

# Introduction  

This chapter is intended to assist the helicopter instructor in  further explaining attitude instrument flying in helicopters.  When appropriate, refer to the Instrument Flying Handbook  and the Advanced Avionics Handbook for the definition  or further explanation of a system instrument. Many of the  current helicopter instrument systems have been included in  those handbooks; however, it is not feasible to include every  helicopter instrument system that may be installed in any  particular helicopter. Instrument systems on different aircraft  serve the same purpose; however, the configuration of the  instrument panel and the design may be somewhat different.  

Ideally, the helicopter instructor will wait to explain this  chapter until after a basic understanding of instruments is  achieved. Once the student understands the basics, then  actual helicopter flights reinforce what was taught in this  chapter. This chapter is intended as a building block towards  attaining an instrument rating. Students will be taught  attitude instrument flying and should apply all of the basic  maneuvering flight skills that have already been mastered.  

# Instructor’s Objective  

An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for  training the instrument rating pilot applicant to acceptable  standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and  maneuvers included within the appropriate instrument  rating practical test standard. Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 61, section 61.195(c), states  that basic instrument maneuver training for private pilot  students and lower need not have an instrument instructor  rating, if the instructor has instrument privileges on his or her  pilot certificate. Because their teaching activities affect the  development of safe and proficient pilots, flight instructors  should exhibit a high level of knowledge, skill, and the ability  to impart that knowledge and skill to students.  

It is important to find out the student’s background during  the initial portion of instrument training. New students with  only basic maneuvering instruction provide a different set of  challenges for the instructor than a more experienced pilot  (e.g., a pilot who has flown by instruments in a fixed-wing  aircraft). The instructor must know who is being trained and  what tendencies or trends may commonly be observed. Just  as with any other instructional approach, instructor ability to  identify and correct student error is based on the instructor’s  ability to cull from knowledge and experience. The instructor  should reference the specific helicopter sections in the  Instrument Flying Handbook, which includes full discussions  on helping an airplane pilot transition to helicopters.  

Additionally, the flight instructor must certify that the  applicant is able to perform safely as an instrument pilot and  is competent to pass the required practical test.  

Discuss with the student:  

•	 Flying with the instruments is essentially visual flying  with the flight instruments substituted for the various  reference points on the helicopter and the natural  horizon. •	 The IFR helicopter pilot cannot reference the rotor tip  path to the horizon, but depend instead on the artificial  horizon for a reference.  

•	 There is no difference in helicopter control inputs  between flying visual flight rules (VFR) and  instrument flight rules (IFR). •	 There is no outside reference and a pilot must trust  what is presented on the helicopter instruments. •	 Basic instrument training is intended to be a building  block toward attaining an instrument rating.  

# Ground Instruction  

In a classroom environment, work with the student to begin  developing a basic knowledge of the terms associated  with attitude instrument flight. One way to capture the  student’s level of understanding is by requesting that the  student identify the location of the instrument located in the  helicopter, explain what each instrument is used for during  attitude instrument flight, including its indications and  limitations. The following instruments should be covered in  the lesson plan: airspeed indicator, altimeter, vertical speed  indicator (VSI), attitude indicator, heading indicator, and  turn indicator.  [Figure 13-1]  

•	 The student should learn the names and locations of the  pitot static instruments (airspeed indicator, altimeter,  and VSI), their use in preflight and airborne checks,  and common errors. •	 The student should learn the name and location of each  gyroscopic instrument (attitude indicator, heading  indicator, and turn indicator), their use in preflight  and airborne checks, and common errors. •	 The student should learn about the magnetic compass  to include magnetic variation, magnetic dip, and  compass deviation, as well as preflight checks,  airborne checks, and common errors.  

Students have been known to be intimidated by instrument  flying. Lack of experience and/or poor training can contribute  to this. An instructor’s goal is to keep the training and the  lesson plan as interesting as possible. Once the student  understands what each instrument does, knows how to use  it and develops a good cross-check, he or she will overcome  the intimidation factor. The amount of time spent on each  area is determined by the individual’s ability to achieve a  satisfactory level of proficiency. A portion of the instrument  training may utilize a flight simulator, flight training device,  or a personal computer-based aviation training device  (PCATD).  [Figure 13-2]

Figure 13-1.   Instruments that should be discussed when teaching instrument flying: airspeed indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter, turn  indicator, heading indicator, and vertical speed indicator (VSI).

Figure 13-2.    Helicopter simulator used for training purposes.  

The instructor must help the student form the correct scanning  habits from the very first instrument flight, whether it is  in the helicopter or in a flight simulator. Students have a  tendency to stare at one instrument, which allows the other  instruments to exceed tolerances very quickly. A VFR pilot  must scan the instruments and gauges, as well as the sky,  for traffic and obstructions. An IFR student must scan the  gauges and instruments, and maybe the outside if there is  anything to view.  

One common problem is attempting to stare at an instrument  while a correction is being made. A student should be taught  to scan, determine the issue or problem, make a control  change, and then continue the scan. The result of the control  change is checked on the next scan. The student must  remember that inertia of the helicopter and all the changes  require some finite period of time, so changes neither occur  instantly nor would we usually wish to make abrupt changes  of large magnitude.  

# Flight Instruction  

Once the student has an understanding of the instruments  and knows the location of each, then the next logical step  would be an actual flight.  [Figure 13-3]  Prior to the flight,  the student should review all the instruments that will be used  for the particular helicopter being flown and learn how to  perform an instrument cross-check, instrument interpretation,  and aircraft control.  

![](images/ba67753fd8fa1fb604277d9a25af94d3a937b6da5059b5d8237a419f570f02c6.jpg)  
Figure 13-3.   Demonstrate to the student that proper instrument interpretation is the basis for aircraft control.  

When teaching the student about flying a helicopter with  reference to the flight instruments, the key is getting that  student to understand that proper instrument interpretation  is the basis for aircraft control. Skill, in part, depends  on understanding how a particular instrument or system  functions, including its indications and limitations. With this  knowledge, the student can quickly interpret an instrument  indication and translate that information into a control  response. Start with simple tasks, and then progress to the  more complex tasks.  

The student should be able to demonstrate performance of  the following tasks at a satisfactory level:  

•	 Straight-and-level flight •	 Straight climbs •	 Straight descents •	 Turns: predetermined heading, timed, change of  airspeed,   $30^{\circ}$   bank, climbing and descending, and  compass •	 Unusual attitudes  

•	 Emergencies •	 Instrument takeoff  

Perform a learning check by asking the student the location  and function of each instrument used for attitude instrument  flight. During flight, these demonstrations indicate if the  student is able to maintain aircraft control during attitude  instrument flight using both cross-check and instrument  interpretation. Ensure the student knows what to do if the  instrument fails and how that failure affects the scan being  used. Allocate adequate time to train recovery from unusual  attitudes. The student needs an understanding of the errors  inherent in each instrument and common errors for the tasks  to be performed.  

# Instructional Techniques  

Instrument flying is simply composed of level, turning,  climbing, and descending instrument flight maneuvers. Do  not overwhelm the student on the first instrument training  flight. Use the building block technique by introducing one  flight task at a time. Allow the student to fly and maintain  a set altitude. Then, introduce heading control and then  airspeed control. The instructor’s main duty is to divide the  instrument procedures into small enough tasks to enable  the student to grasp the concepts, acknowledge the desired  outcomes, and understand the methods to use and when to  use them to achieve the necessary performance.  

The student should understand that the helicopter never  really flies straight and level. Only after much practice  does it begin to appear to fly in that fashion. Due to the  very small tolerances in the control system, each rotor  blade flies a very slightly different path every revolution.  Therefore, the helicopter pilot must continually make small  corrections to achieve what passes for straight-and-level  flight. This characteristic is the practical reason that IFR  certified helicopters must have a fully functional autopilot  or be crewed by two pilots for IFR operations.  Helicopters  are very controllable, but not necessarily stable.  Therefore,  cockpit organization and flight planning is very essential.  Depending on the helicopter, some sort of crew training and  resource management must be incorporated into this training.  

When training instrument flight to a transitioning airplane  pilot, instructors should explain or reiterate the differences  between an airplane and helicopter. For example, an airplane  must be pointed up on the artificial horizon in order to climb,  whereas a helicopter can climb quite well with its nose down.  Conversely, an airplane is pointed down to descend but in  a helicopter, the nose is raised and the collective is lowered  to descend. Instrument flight can cause a student to become  tense or get behind on tasks, which may cause a transitioning  pilot to revert back to the first learned airplane habits.  

Often, a student may seem to be depressed from seeing so  many errors during IFR flight training periods.  That is when  the instructor should congratulate the student because that  is when flying really begins to improve; the student sees the  errors and, with practice, learns the proper amount of control  movement to correct those errors in a timely but controllable  manner.  

# Student Tendencies  

Some common student tendencies are:  

•	 Inconsistent or no scanning technique •	 Staring too long at one flight instrument  •	 Not analyzing what they see  •	 Exaggerated flight control inputs •	 Failure to correlate control inputs  

While discussion of scanning can be done in the classroom,  the actual practice does not yield results until in flight.  Depending on the instrument panel layout, have the student  determine the most useful scan. (According to the Instrument  Flying Handbook, no specific method of cross-checking  (scanning) is recommended; the pilot must learn to determine  which instruments give the most pertinent information for  any particular phase of a maneuver.)  

Watch the student’s head and eyes to see if fixation is  occurring. If the student stares too long at one instrument  (heading indicator, as an example) then other parameters  are usually affected (altitude, airspeed, trim, etc.). This can  have a snowball effect as the student will eventually become  overwhelmed.  

Ensure the student allows time to see and interpret the  particular instrument, within the chosen scanning technique,  and makes the necessary flight control input. Failure to take  action may be a result of not processing the information  present or absent in the scan of a particular instrument.  

When applying control input corrections, the student should  use small inputs and allow time for them to take effect. Too  often the student identifies and responds with the correct input  but does not allow adequate time for the input to achieve the  result. This can lead to overcontrolling.  

Initially, failure to correlate corresponding inputs is a  common tendency. The student may need to be reminded of  the associated control inputs normally used for the various  instrument indications. Frequent breaks and discussion may  be needed to allow the student time to process the information  presented before continuing practical application.  

An example of this occurs when a student notes an increasing  rate of climb and reacts by placing forward cyclic. Forward  cyclic alone arrests the climb rate, but it also produces  an increase in airspeed. In this example, however, during  repeated attempts, the student repeatedly fails to make a  corresponding reduction in power, and airspeed continually  increases. The student may not correlate the impact of  forward cyclic on airspeed, instead focusing only on rate  of climb. Repeating the fault to the student while he or she  continues to fly may result in sensory overload.  

Have the student transfer the controls, take a moment, then  reemphasize the learning point by demonstrating the correct  control inputs with the student watching. Remind the student  that the position of the flight controls never stays the same  when flying a helicopter. Even flying straight and level  requires change and adjustment to the flight controls and, as  more fuel is used, the helicopter becomes lighter. Instrument  flying is really precision flying and students will slowly start  noticing small changes without pilot input and need to be  reminded of that. Then, transfer aircraft control back to the  student and have the student repeat the maneuver.  

Stress to the student the need to maintain a consistent scan  technique and to maintain situational awareness of all  indicators. Over time, the student’s scan and response time  will improve.  

During advanced instrument training, allowing the student  to work through some of these issues can be beneficial to  the student’s confidence. However, the new student can  quickly become overwhelmed and will not understand what  is happening. Therefore, it is not good practice to allow the  new pilot to become overly frustrated when first learning  simple instrument tasks.  

Reference the Instrument Flying Handbook for discussion  on these additional topics:

# Instructional Objectives  

Continue to reinforce the basic standards throughout this  training. Proper performance planning can be used to  demonstrate the understanding and use of power settings  in stabilized instrument flight techniques. Knowing the  power settings used for climbs, level flight, and approaches  as well as the various instrument flight modes decreases  confusion and/or searching by the student pilot. During use  of the checklist, help the student understand the importance  of checking items, such as flight instruments during hover  checks. Also, tie in the importance of altimeter settings  and the fluctuations that may occur when hovering IGE.  The instructor should be explaining the reasons for the  instrument takeoff following the maximum performance  takeoff profile in order to gain altitude as quickly as possible  to clear obstructions and the specified minimum instrument  airspeed for that helicopter. Special care should be taken to  fully explain helicopter approaches, required airspeeds, and  the underlying reasons for those restrictions.  

The instructor’s role is to identify, analyze, and make specific  corrective suggestions to help the student. Pointing out  parameter errors, such as, “Your heading is off, your altitude  is off, your airspeed is off…” without providing detailed  corrective action does not help the student. Assess the cause  and provide methods or techniques to correct the situation.  

Whether a ground or flight training session, each training  period should end with a thorough debriefing of what  transpired and what will be covered in the next training  period. Ask for the student’s perception of the training. The  student should not walk away unaware of what occurred  during this training session, or what will be covered in the  next session.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Review with the student how all the flight instruments  operate and the actual location of each instrument  inside the helicopter. •	 Review and practice with the student what instruments  are utilized during attitude instrument flight. •	 Practice a “good cross-check” with the student. •	 Practice with the student how to interpret the  instruments during flight. •	 Ensure the student uses smooth control inputs at all  times during flight.  

•	 Review with the student the common errors with each  task and instrument.  

•	 If appropriate, tell the student well ahead of time what  will be covered (task(s) to be flown) for the lesson  plan and what the student should study or reference. [Figure 13-4]

# Chapter 14 Night Operations  

# Introduction  

By definition, night flight is flying between the hours of  sunset (end of evening civil twilight) and sunrise (beginning  of morning civil twilight). During day or night, vision is the  sense that makes a pilot aware of the position of the helicopter  in space. The eyes can rapidly identify and interpret visual  cues during daylight. During darkness, however, visual  acuity is decreased proportionally as the level of illumination  decreases. Night vision devices improve the capability of  the human eye to see at night. Night vision goggles (NVGs)  are being utilized more and more by police departments,  emergency management services, and civilian pilots. This  chapter covers only night flight without the use of NVGs.  

#  

#  

# Instructor’s Objective  

Vision is the most important sense for flying. Vision allows  us to perceive our position relative to the horizon, observe  our location, see and avoid obstructions, and read aircraft  instruments and charts. However, in comparison to most other  mammals, humans have poor vision in low light conditions.  As an instructor, ensure that the student has a working  knowledge of visual deficiencies and the techniques that the  student can employ to overcome them.  

Night vision is of particular interest to the helicopter pilot  because a helicopter often lands at unimproved sites with  no lighting other than what the helicopter furnishes. Night  flying can be overwhelming to a new student, especially  when leaving the comfort of a lighted airport. Students  must learn that potential hazards, such as wires, poles, and  towers, become even more dangerous at night as they are not  always marked or lighted. The flight profile of the helicopter  is typically at a low altitude, which is where most obstacles  exist. The instructor should familiarize the student with an area  during daylight hours and point out all of the hazards that need  to be avoided during a night flight. Another challenge for the  student is manipulating the searchlight while flying. It is very  easy for the student to become fixated on the light or forget to  fly the helicopter while trying to place the light in the correct  position. Allow the student time to become familiar with the  searchlight while on the ground before attempting it in flight.  

Another critical issue to address when beginning night flight  training is light discipline in the cockpit and how it can  affect the ability to see what is around you. As a protection  against damaging itself, the eye always adjusts for the  brightest light level. If the helicopter’s interior lights are  brighter than the outside ambient light level, the eye adjusts  to see the brighter inside lights, greatly limiting the ability  to see outside the helicopter. The correct cockpit lighting is  essential to night flying.  

It is important that the student has in-depth knowledge of  the eye, visual acuity, and the function of rods and cones.  Discuss the terms associated with night flight, including the  parts and functions of the eye, visual illusions, and night  scanning techniques. This information can be found in greater  detail in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, the Helicopter Flying  Handbook, and Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 91. Additionally, pilots can consult updated  information for end of evening civil twilight (EECT) and  beginning of morning civil twilight (BMCT) in the document  Complete Sun and Moon Data for One Day: U.S. Cities  and Towns at http://www.usno.navy.mil. Review these  handbooks and regulations with the student and, when  appropriate, ask the student to explain night scanning, aircraft  lighting, and visual illusions. Achieving these objectives  is crucial for the student when performing night flight and  applying the night flight techniques.  

# Eye Anatomy and Physiology  

The eye is similar to a camera. The cornea, lens, and iris  gather and control the amount of light allowed to enter the  eye. The image is then focused on the retina, which has  two types of cells: cones and rods.  [Figure 14-1]  Review  the anatomy of the eye and discuss the night blind spot.  [Figure 14-2]  This discussion should focus on vision while  in flight to include visual acuity and the eye’s rods and  cones. The more a student knows about the eyes and how  they function, the easier it is to use vision effectively and  compensate for potential problems.  

# Visual Problems  

There are several visual problems, or conditions, that affect  night vision. Discuss with the student the visual deficiencies,  such as myopia, night myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism,  and presbyopia. Refer the student to the Helicopter Flying  Handbook for in-depth definitions of each visual problem and  how each can affect night flying. Instructors should be aware  of any specific visual problems that the student may have that  could affect his or her ability to fly at night. For example,  if the student wears glasses, are the glasses reflecting glare  from an unnecessary light? Do the glasses have a coating that  interferes with night vision? Does the student wear sunglasses  during the day to protect night vision? If the student is older,  has he or she been screened for cataracts, which could cause  night vision problems? The instructor must teach the student  about all possible visual problems but also be aware of any  that the student may have.  

# Ground Instruction  

In a classroom environment, review all terms associated with  night operations. Explain to the student how to protect night  vision, how to recognize self-imposed stress, the negative  effects on night vision from smoking, and the various scanning  techniques for night flight. It is also important that visual  illusions are explained in detail with information regarding  how to detect and react to the illusions. Aircraft instruments  are easier to read under higher levels of interior illumination.  However, this need must be balanced with the ability to  see outside and the hazard of interior lights reflecting off  the interior surfaces. Minimize interior lighting, whenever  possible, without hindering reading of essential instruments.  

# Night Vision Protection  

Explain to the student that protecting night vision should  always be a priority. Discuss some of the steps to take to  protect night vision such as the use of sunglasses and oxygen.  Repeated exposure to bright sunlight has an increasingly  

![](images/0375498e117e63251491708a9a71df4b26a48f8ce459b2d1b3971bf7eb1d6afb.jpg)

adverse effect on dark adaptation. Point out that this effect  is intensified by reflective surfaces, such as sand and snow.  Sunglasses aid in filtering the bright sunlight and increase  the rate of dark adaptation at night while improving night  visual sensitivity.  [Figure 14-3]  

![](images/4a341b2a7867888cb56fd76e07436ec0c2f9a66faa624fae5b932a1bcfedab71.jpg)  
Figure 14-3.    Pilot and passenger wear sunglasses to protect their  eyes from bright sunlight.  

Explain to a student that unaided night vision depends on  optimum function and sensitivity of the rods of the retina.  Lack of oxygen to the rods significantly reduces their  sensitivity and increases the time required for dark adaptation,  as well as decreases the ability to see at night. Since most  helicopters do not carry oxygen, more practical advice to give  a student who smokes is either to quit or at least reduce the  amount that they smoke and advise that physical conditioning  helps not only the heart, but also assists the body’s ability to  increase oxygen intake. If oxygen is available, pilots should  use it when flying above a pressure altitude of 4,000 feet.  

Additional precautions to discuss with the student pertain to  the airport or heliport lighting. Any light sources that may  impair the student’s dark adaptation should be eliminated.  Tell the student to try to select departure routes that avoid  highways and residential areas where artificial light can  impair night vision. If bright lights are encountered from  a specific direction, turn the aircraft away from the light  source when able. If this is not possible, instruct the student  to preserve dark adaptation by shutting one eye and using the  other to observe. Once the light source is no longer visible,  the eye that was closed can provide the required night vision.  

# Self-Imposed Stress  

Night flight is more fatiguing and stressful than day flight  because the brain has to work harder in order to make sense  of the limited visual cues or the lack of visual acuity. The  pilot must scan more in order to gain sufficient visual cues  to maintain the desired flight path. Many helicopters are not  well equipped for night flight. Most charts and maps are  harder to read and interpret in low levels of light. Inform  the student of several self-imposed stressors that limit night  vision, such as drugs, illness, fatigue, alcohol, and tobacco.  For example, if an individual smokes 3 cigarettes in rapid  succession or 20 to 40 cigarettes within a 24-hour period,  the physiological effect at ground level is the same as flying  at 5,000 feet. More importantly, the smoker has lost about  20 percent of night vision capability at sea level. Review  the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge with the  student to ensure a better understanding of these types of  stressors and place emphasis on the fact that the student can  control this type of stress.  

# Scanning Techniques  

It is important to teach the student various night vision  techniques that enable him or her to overcome many of the  physiological limitations of their eyes. These techniques  require considerable practice and concerted effort on the  part of the student and the instructor as they are important  in identifying objects at night.  

Instruct the student that to scan effectively, looking from  right to left or left to right. Tell the student to begin scanning  at the greatest distance an object can be perceived (top) and  move inward toward the position of the aircraft (bottom).  [Figure 14-4]  For each stop, an area approximately  $30^{\circ}$   wide  should be scanned. The duration of each stop is based on the  

![](images/90c94c659f79888dbf1b226a603967491e3262f4712d1cea8a7d5984528e3e3c.jpg)  
Figure 14-4.    Scanning pattern.  

degree of detail that is required, but no stop should last longer  than two to three seconds. When moving from one viewing  point to the next, the student should overlap the previous field  of view by  $10^{\circ}$  .  

Viewing an object using central vision during daylight poses  no limitation. If this same technique is used at night, however,  the object may not be seen because of the night blind spot that  exists during low illumination. Explain to the student that in  order to compensate for this limitation, he or she can use off- center vision. This technique requires that an object be viewed  by looking  $10^{\circ}$   above, below, or to either side of the object. In  this manner, the peripheral vision can maintain contact with an  object. Ensure that the student understands that, with off-center  vision, the images of an object viewed longer than 2 to 3 seconds  disappear. This occurs because the rods reach a photochemical  equilibrium that prevents any further response until the scene  changes. This produces a potentially unsafe operating condition.  To overcome this night vision limitation, the student must be  aware of the phenomenon and avoid viewing an object for longer  than 2 or 3 seconds. The peripheral field of vision continues to  pick up the object when the eyes are shifted from one off-center  point to another.  [Figure 14-5]  

# Visual Illusions  

Decreasing visual information increases the probability of  spatial disorientation. Ensure the student understands that  reduced visual references also create several illusions that can  induce spatial disorientation. Many types of visual illusions  can occur in flight and it is important that the student becomes  familiar with the various types to include:  

•	 Flicker vertigo—much time and research have  been devoted to the study of flicker vertigo. A light  flickering at a rate between 4 and 20 cycles per second  can produce unpleasant and dangerous reactions. Such  conditions as nausea, vomiting, and vertigo may occur.  On rare occasions, convulsions and unconsciousness  may also occur. Flicker vertigo is why the regulations  allow pilots to disable the strobe lights and anti- collision beacons while flying in the clouds.  

•	 Fixation—occurs when pilots ignore orientation cues  and fix their attention on a goal or an object. This is  dangerous because helicopter ground-closure rates are  difficult to determine at night.  

•	 False horizons—cloud formations may be confused  with the horizon or the ground. While hovering over  terrain that is not perfectly level, the pilot might  mistake the sloped ground in front of the helicopter  for the horizon and cause the helicopter to drift while  trying to maintain a stationary position. Another  example is a lighted road climbing a mountain side  can easily be mistaken for a flat horizon.  

•	 Confusion with ground lights—a common occurrence  is to confuse ground lights with stars. When  this happens, the pilot unknowingly positions  the helicopter in unusual attitudes to keep the  ground lights—believed to be stars—above them.  [Figure 14-6]  

•	 Relative motion—the illusion of relative motion can be  illustrated by an example. A pilot hovers a helicopter  and waits for hover taxi instructions. Another aircraft  hovers alongside. As the other aircraft is picked up  in the first pilot’s peripheral vision, the pilot senses  movement in the opposite direction.  

•	 Altered planes of reference—when approaching a line  of mountains or clouds, the pilot may feel the need  to climb despite adequate altitude. Also, when flying  parallel to a line of clouds, pilots may feel that they  need to climb even though their altitude is adequate.  

•	 Structural illusions—these illusions are caused by heat  waves, rain, snow, sleet, or other factors that obscure  vision. For example, a straight line may appear to  be curved when seen through a desert heat wave or  a wingtip light may appear to double or move when  viewed during a rain shower.  

•	 Height and depth perception illusion—due to lack  of visual references when flying over desert, snow,  water, or other areas of poor contrast, the pilot may  

![](images/b5851683ff92f5cf85a874613dbef080c39d3d22ee176c4645c5787fdc99d616.jpg)

Figure 14-6.    This illusion prompts the pilot to place the aircraft in an unusual attitude to keep the misperceived ground lights above  them. Isolated ground lights can appear as stars (Part A). When no stars are visible because of overcast conditions, unlighted areas of  terrain can blend with the dark overcast to create the illusion that the unlighted terrain is part of the sky (Part B). This illusion can be  avoided by referencing the flight instruments and establishing a true horizon and attitude.  

experience the illusion of being higher above the  terrain than is actually the case. This illusion may be  overcome by dropping an object, such as a chemical  light stick or flare, on the ground before landing.  Another technique used to overcome this illusion is  to monitor shadows cast by nearby objects, such as  the skid shadows at a hover. Flight in an area where  visibility is restricted by haze, smoke, or fog produces  the same illusion.  

•	 Size-distance illusion—results from viewing a source  of light that is increasing or decreasing in luminance  (brightness). The pilot may interpret the light as  approaching or retreating.  

•	 Autokinesis—when the pilot stares at a static light in  the dark, the light appears to move. This phenomenon  can be readily demonstrated by staring at a lighted  cigarette in a dark room. Apparent movement begins  in about 8 to 10 seconds. Although the cause of  autokinesis is not known, it appears to be related  to the loss of surrounding references that normally  serve to stabilize visual perceptions. This illusion  can be eliminated or reduced by visual scanning, by  increasing the number of lights, or by varying the light  intensity. The most important of the three solutions  is visual scanning. You should not stare at a light or  lights for more than 10 seconds. This illusion is not  limited to light in darkness. It can occur whenever  you stare at a small, bright, still object against a  dull, dark or nondescript background. Similarly, it  can occur when a small, dark, still object is viewed  against a light, structureless environment. Anytime  visual references are not available, pilots are subject  to this illusion. Instructors can also relate this illusion  to the helicopter’s landing light. It becomes very easy  to focus on that one beam of light and not see the  peripheral vision cues of lateral or rotating movement.  Staring into the landing light also tends to ruin much of  the accumulated night vision, leaving the pilot nearly  blind when the landing light is extinguished  

•	 Reversible perspective illusion—at night, an aircraft  may appear to be moving away when it is, in fact,  moving toward a second aircraft. This illusion often  occurs when an aircraft is flying parallel to another’s  course. To determine the direction of flight, aircrews  should observe aircraft lights and their relative  position to the horizon. If the intensity of the lights  increases, the aircraft is approaching. If the lights dim,  the aircraft is moving away. Also, remembering the “3  Rs” helps identify the direction of travel when other  aircraft are encountered. If the red aircraft position  lights are on the right, the aircraft is returning (coming  toward the observer).  [Figure 14-7]  

# Flight Instruction  

Students should receive adequate ground instruction and  classroom training prior to advancing to actual flight  training. Proper classroom instruction ensures that students  are aware of the limitations of night flight and helps ensure  a safer operating environment. Once the student has shown  proficiency and is comfortable with the demands of night  flight, the actual night flying can successfully commence.  

![](images/7f489714c7d0806364725d5c894594f14837e70ac59b374b1827396322349ece.jpg)  
Figure 14-7.    Remembering the “3 Rs” helps identify the direction of travel when other aircraft are encountered. If the red aircraft  position lights are on the right, the aircraft is returning (moving toward the observer).  

# Preflight Inspection  

The aircraft preflight inspection is a critical aspect of  safety, and it must comply with the appropriate aircraft  operator’s manual. Preflight should be scheduled as early  as possible, preferably during daylight hours, allowing time  for maintenance assistance if necessary. If a night preflight  is necessary, a flashlight with an unfiltered lens should be  used to supplement lighting. Oil and hydraulic fluid levels  and leaks are difficult to detect with blue-green or red lens.  Windscreens must be checked to ensure they are clean and  relatively free of scratches. Slight scratches are acceptable for  day but may not be acceptable for night flight. The searchlight  or landing light should be positioned for the best possible  illumination during an emergency descent.  

Also included in preflight planning, the student should be  tasked with deciding how to read the checklist and charts at  night. Cockpit organization is a very important chore that  must be accomplished before flight. The instructor could  have an auxiliary power unit (APU) or power cart connected  to the helicopter at night so the student can practice cockpit  organization. Small items can become large problems if a  flashlight is dropped and blocks the flight controls or a map or  checklist is left on the dashboard and blocks the windscreen.  The student must learn how to manage a flashlight, map, and  checklist while flying at night.  

Instructors should review the heliport and airport lighting  with the student to include beacons. Since helicopters do  not normally use runways, the low blue intensity of airport  taxiway lighting should be pointed out. Teach the student  that some obstructions around the airport may be lighted but  some may not. Pilots should always be looking for wind sock  poles, light poles, ASOS/AWOS installations, and other off- runway obstacles. Many of these hazards should be pointed  out during the day flights and then again during the night,  especially the ones that are not lighted. The student should  be prompted to begin developing a hazard map of the area  and shown how to properly keep it updated.  

Proper preparation of the helicopter for night flight  contributes greatly to the success of the flight; however, you  should stress to the student that, unless he or she is physically  and mentally prepared to participate in the night flight, the  flight is considered unsafe. Discuss the following checklist  with the student prior to flight to ensure readiness:  

•	 Dark adapt before flight •	 Avoid self-imposed stress •	 Avoid bright sunlight during the day •	 Learn to use the principles of night vision •	 Avoid all bright lights after dark adaptation  

Participate in frequent night flights to ensure the student can  demonstrate the tasks listed below to a satisfactory level:  

•	 Preflight and aircraft lighting •	 Proper cockpit lighting •	 Engine starting (rotor engagement, if installed) •	 Taxi •	 Takeoff •	 En route procedures •	 Specific night emergencies ○ 	 Light failure ○ 	 Alternator failure ○ 	 Loss of orientation ○ 	 Inadvertent IFR •	 Collision avoidance •	 Approach and landing  

Each instructor must determine what type of night training  is best for each particular student based on that student’s  learning style and understanding. It is beneficial to require  portions of training with and without aircraft lighting and  training with night vision devices, when necessary. Ensure  that the training is always based on the appropriate Rotorcraft  Flight Manual (RFM) of the particular helicopter being flown  and that the training is tailored to the individual’s needs.  Remember, a successful training session depends on adequate  support such as flight hours, equipment, and training areas.  See  Figure 14-8  for a sample lesson plan.  

Training should begin in high ambient light levels, such as  a full moon, and progress to successively lower light levels.  Students should first perform maneuvers to prepared surfaces.  As proficiency increases, allow the student to progress to  lighted sites and then to unlighted sites.  

Navigation training should begin with easy routes. As the  student becomes more proficient, he or she can fly routes with  legs of 50 to 100 nautical miles. More difficult and realistic  scenarios should have possible landing areas interspersed  along the route.  

Communication with the student and actions (sequence or  timing) are necessary for students to perform flight tasks  efficiently, effectively, and safely. If a particular task is labor  intensive and requires additional time from the student, assist  in performing that task until the student’s confidence and  understanding is achieved.  

Specific night flight emergencies, such as light failure,  alternator failure, and loss of orientation by either too much  information over a broad metropolitan area or too few lights  over open country, should be discussed, practiced, and  evaluated. Depending on the student’s status and progress, the  first few night flights should be short to allow the student time  to adjust and absorb all the new information. Students have  a tendency to tire very quickly when starting night training,  and it is the job of the instructor to prevent the student from  getting to that point as fatigue is detrimental to training. As  the student acclimates to the environment, training times can  be lengthened to facilitate training.  

Note: Discuss with the student that controlled flight into  terrain seems to be the major fatal error made by pilots  particularly during night flights. Therefore, the student must  understand that anything that casts a shadow or appears to  be blocking lights, natural or manmade, should be treated  as an obstacle.  

If weather conditions fall below 1,000 feet and 3 miles while  attempting to fly VFR at night, particularly during training,  cancelation of the flight would be a wise decision. This also  shows the student sound decision making and hopefully that  student will carry that forward with him the rest of his flying  career. Also, the weather may be greater than a 1,000/3 but  no ambient light is visible (no stars are visible); in this case,  if VFR night flight is accomplished, use a higher en route  altitude (minimum safe altitude from VFR chart). If the  weather temporarily limits visibility, such as a strong rain  storm, day or night, teach the student to land the helicopter  and wait for the weather to pass. Discuss flying at lower  airspeeds during limited visibility, as well as the development  of IMC conditions, such as fog or condensation. If your visual  field suddenly becomes blurry, or difficult to see, it is usually  because the weather is changing. This should be an excellent  cue to make a decision about aborting the flight.  

Teach the student that simply flying direct from one point to  the next is fine for day VFR. However, night flights demand  more attention to navigate successfully. Using distant towns,  towers, or any other lit object is acceptable during night  flights. Major roads with traffic also provide a means to  navigate during hours of darkness. Remind the student of  the blue maximum elevation figures that are published on the  sectional charts and their importance in night route planning.

# Postflight Discussion  

Review what was covered during this phase of training. If any problems were encountered during the flight tasks,  correct or, if necessary, retrain the student in that particular task(s). Discuss what will be covered on the next  lesson plan.  

If the flight is planned to be above the maximum elevations,  all obstructions should be cleared by a reasonable margin.  Proper flight planning can truly save a life or lives.  

If the helicopter is IFR equipped and the student is IFR rated,  than teach the student IFR recovery techniques.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Ensure that the student can recognize and understands  the visual deficiencies. •	 Ensure the student has a basic understanding of the  anatomy and physiology of the eye. •	 Point out visual illusions to the student during flight,  when possible. •	 Discuss with the student the inability to see weather  phenomena while flying at night. •	 Discuss how unusual attitudes are harder to detect at  night without the normal visual references. •	 If corrective lenses are prescribed to aircrew members,  they must use corrective lenses (glasses) in all modes  of flight. •	 Be aware that it will take 30 to 45 minutes for the  average individual’s eyes to reach maximum dark  adaptation. •	 Use off-center vision when viewing objects under  reduced lighting conditions. •	 Avoid self-imposed stress. •	 Protect night vision by avoiding bright lights once  dark adaptation has been achieved. •	 Scan using a series of short, regularly spaced eye  movements between being still for a second at a time.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter described the basic anatomy and physiology  of the eye. Night flying and visual illusions were explained,  and how a pilot can overcome them while in flight. Various  techniques were described to teach the student safer ways  to conduct flight at night. Instructors should ensure that the  student has a basic understanding of the requirements and  common problems associated with night flying.  

Chapter 15  

# Helicopter Operations  

# Introduction  

This chapter provides information to help the instructor  guide the student through various helicopter operations. It  includes operational and safety considerations for on the  ground and in the air.  

# Collision Avoidance  

As discussed in this handbook’s Chapter 1, Introduction  to Flight Training, as well as in the Aviation Instructor’s  Handbook, the instructor must ensure the student develops  the habit of looking for other air traffic at all times. If a  student believes the instructor assumes all responsibility for  scanning and collision avoidance procedures, he or she will  not develop the habit of maintaining the constant vigilance  essential to safety. Remember to establish scan areas and  communication practices for keeping the aircraft cleared.  Any observed tendency of a student to enter flight maneuvers  without first making a careful check for other air traffic must  be corrected immediately.  

From the first flight, the instructor must make the student  aware that it is every pilot’s responsibility to see and avoid  other aircraft. Explain the blind areas in the helicopter being  flown, as well as those in other aircraft. Develop in the student  a habit of checking for other aircraft during his or her regular  scan pattern. All radio and radar aids should be used to the  fullest extent possible, but with the realization that they  are only aids, and vigilance should not be relaxed. Radar  traffic advisories are very helpful, but there is evidence that  indicates some pilots become complacent when in the radar  environment and relax their vigil. Also, no turn should ever  be made without first looking in the direction of the turn to see  that the airspace is clear of other traffic. In the vicinity of an  airport, all possible aids should be used and looking for other  aircraft should occupy more of the student’s time. Landing and  anticollision lights should be turned on to make the helicopter  more visible, especially in the vicinity of an airport.  

# Flight instructors should:  

•	 Guard against preoccupation during flight instruction  to the exclusion of maintaining a constant vigilance  for other traffic. •	 Be particularly alert during the conduct of simulated  instrument flight in which there is a tendency to “look  inside.” •	 Place special training emphasis on areas of concern  in which improvements in pilot education, operating  practices, procedures, and techniques are needed to  reduce midair conflicts. •	 Notify the control tower operator, at airports where a  tower is manned, regarding student first solo flights. •	 Explain the availability and encourage the use of  expanded radar services for arriving and departing  aircraft at terminal airports where this service is  available, as well as the use of radar traffic advisory  services for transiting terminal areas or flying between  en route points.  

•	 Understand and explain the limitations of radar that  may frequently limit or prevent the issuance of radar  advisories by air traffic controllers.  

# Runway Incursions  

Stress upon the student that, even though helicopters do not  regularly use runways for takeoffs and landings, runway  incursions need to be understood and discussed. Students  need to listen carefully to any clearances and instructions  from air traffic control (ATC) and acknowledge them in full.  They should also be aware of their position and the position  of other aircraft and obstructions at all times.  [Figure 15-1] During flight training, instructors often use runways to  practice maneuvers and procedures. Extra vigilance must  be exercised under these circumstances as the instructor and  student may become so focused on the particular maneuver or  procedure that they become inattentive to the surroundings.  

# Safety Considerations  

Good manners are an essential part of helicopter operations.  If a helicopter is not operated with consideration for nearby  persons and property, it can be a nuisance or, even worse, a  hazard. A considerate attitude must be cultivated by example  and instruction from the beginning of training. Stress to  the student that the helicopter’s unique ability of landing  and taking off near a crowd of people creates downwash  that can stir up debris and blow it at high velocity for a  considerable distance, causing possible injury to people and  damage to property. Remind the student of the potential  hazard of someone on the ground walking into turning  rotors.  [Figure 15-2]  The tail rotor, in particular, is hard to  notice. Therefore, it is mandatory that a student understand  the potential hazards to others created by a helicopter and the  pilot’s responsibility to prevent them. The rotor tip-path plane  is not always easy to see, and it may be difficult to judge its  distance from fixed objects. A beginning student should be  encouraged to maintain more than adequate clearance from all  objects and to be constantly aware of both main and tail rotor  paths. The instructor should review with the student the pilot  handbook and discuss the danger areas of the main and tail  rotor clearance distances. Review  Figure 1-5  with student.  

# Traffic Patterns  

The student must be able to describe the traffic patterns  used by both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, naming the  legs and specifying pattern altitudes. The student must also  demonstrate the ability to fly traffic patterns at uncontrolled  fields while avoiding the flow of fixed-wing traffic and  complying with tower instructions at controlled airports.  [Figure 15-3]  

![](images/810d0e40ca07e73b78edf82d4e774c39e340f5c49fa7150efefc758ce9aec631.jpg)

Figure 15-2.   Rotor danger zones.  

# Instructional Points  

•	 The student should learn the correct procedures for  fixed-wing aircraft at controlled and uncontrolled  airports. This knowledge provides the student with an  understanding of where to expect fixed-wing aircraft  and how to avoid them in the traffic pattern. Teach  the student how to search the airport facility guide to  check for the fixed-wing traffic pattern in order to be  able to avoid the flow of traffic. Instructors should  also reference the Helicopter Flying Handbook, which  details fixed-wing traffic patterns and how helicopters  can avoid the traffic and learn how to operate in it in  the event the tower has mixed traffic.  

•	 Advise the student to pay attention to any wind  indicators, such as wind socks, flags, and smoke.

 •	 Typically, traffic patterns in a helicopter are flown  lower and closer than those flown by fixed-wing  aircraft. The typical traffic pattern altitude is 500–800  feet above ground level (AGL) for helicopters, while  for most fixed-wing aircraft it is 1,000–1,500 feet AGL.

 	 Note: Always refer to the airport facility guide for  traffic pattern altitudes as some airports use different  altitudes. By regulation, turbine-powered airplanes  should use 1,500 feet for the downwind leg.  

![](images/9ac244db47d809436c3a542ddba79936ee03e3d2bbcc1cb72b4c7e90a3388d1a.jpg)  
Figure 15-3.   Standard airport traffic pattern.  

•	 For training purposes, a rectangular course should be  flown because there is better visibility; the aircraft has  a level portion in each leg that facilitates clearing of  traffic. A rectangular course also allows the pilot to  estimate winds from the amount of crab necessary to  offset the wind drift and provides a repeatable profile  point to begin the approach. It helps the student to  practice good aircraft control profile usable in many  other maneuvers.  

# Common Student Difficulties Drift Correction  

The student might fail to notice the effect of wind, especially  on the downwind and base legs, resulting in a distorted  pattern. If this problem persists, it may be necessary to review  and practice ground reference and tracking maneuvers.  

# Spacing From Other Aircraft  

It is difficult for beginning students to estimate distances  from other aircraft, to estimate the space required to avoid  interference, and to decide whether their own aircraft  and another are on a collision course. Point out that with  converging aircraft, if the other aircraft’s relative position  is not changing, then both aircraft are on a collision course.  In this case, the quickest way to change relative position is  to turn toward the other aircraft’s tail. When two aircraft are  approaching head on, each pilot should alter course to the  right. Review with the student Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.113, Right of Way  Rules: Except Water Operations.  

# Altitude and Airspeed  

Maintaining a constant altitude and airspeed can be very  difficult for the beginning student. Problems can stem from  lack of scanning, chasing the instruments or not flying the  horizon, and not being able to recognize changes in engine  and rotor sounds. Students should be encouraged to use  all of their senses to help focus on the entire aircraft and  not just one or two instruments at a time. Student trouble  with fluctuating airspeeds is often caused by a hand and  arm relaxing on the cyclic. Demonstrate how the arm at the  cyclic slips slowly back when the pilot is fatigued or overly  relaxed, which brings the cyclic back, causing the airspeed  to fluctuate and altitude to increase. If the student is not tall  enough to rest the elbow on a leg while flying, the arm can  tire as the student must hold it up the entire time. Watch  the student’s arm position throughout the flight. If this does  become a problem, place a large sponge or rolled up shirt  between the arm and leg to help with the fatigue, which also  helps to maintain altitude and airspeed. Failure to scan can  also be the cause of altitude and airspeed deviations. Fixating  on instruments or the intended landing area can be fixed by  reminding the student to keep scanning and to focus on more  than just one aspect of the flight.  

# Airspace  

The helicopter instructor should integrate knowledge of the  classifications of airspace throughout the training process  from preflight planning to actual flight. Ensure the student  understands helicopter regulatory requirements for operations  in the various types of airspace based on type of pilot  certificate held. Provide a thorough discussion of airspace  particularly as it is relevant to helicopters. Instruction should  include as a minimum:  

•	 Endorsement requirement for student pilots •	 Equipment requirements •	 Communication requirements •	 Weather minimums  

Discuss the pilot’s responsibility regarding operations in  all airspace and over all types of terrain.  [Figure 15-4]  For  example, operations and procedures in Class B airspace  differ from operations in Class G airspace, and operations in  mountainous terrain differ from operations conducted over  open water. Tie in preflight planning, aeronautical decision- making (ADM), risk management, and other topics as they  relate to airspace and type of operations. Discuss the ATC  System and the services it provides. Refer the student to the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, 14 CFR, and  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) for additional  information.  

# Helicopter Turbine and Multiengine  Transition  

When transitioning a student into either a turbine or  multiengine helicopter, the instructor should carefully plan  the course of instruction to fully encompass the procedures  contained in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) for the  helicopter being used.  

Ensure the student pilot has the opportunity to fly the helicopter  at maximum gross weights to learn the characteristics and  different aircraft responses when the helicopter is fully  loaded. Emergency training should never be conducted while  carrying passengers.  

The student pilot should fully understand the significance of  the helicopter specific airspeeds, such as the takeoff safety  speed for Category A Rotorcraft   $(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{TOS}})$   and Category A  versus Category B helicopter operations and limitations,  powerplant limitations, and possibly transmission limitations  for the helicopter being flown. Instrumentation and  navigation displays must be understood before flight, as well  as the operation of controls such as engine condition levers,  governors, and stability augmentation systems.  

If a multiengine helicopter requires backing up and climbing  some for a Category A takeoff profile, the instructor should  ensure that some reasonable and practical procedure is  taught and practiced to maintain tail rotor and tail boom  obstruction clearance during the maneuver, as discussed in  14 CFR part 25, sections 23.53 through 23.61. In any event,  the instructor must ensure that the student gains a thorough  understanding of the differences between Category A and  Category B operations.  

Additionally, if the helicopter is usually flown with a crew  of two, then crew resource management should be explained  and practiced. Terminology, checklist procedures, crew  coordination, flight briefing, and crew position duties and  responsibilities should be presented and practiced in detail.  

If the student is transitioning to a turbine engine helicopter,  the instructor should review the differences in the powerplant  response to load changes and power demands, the importance  of proper starting procedures, monitoring, limitations, failure  modes, and consequences of poor procedures and inattention.  

When a student transitions into a turbine or multiengine  helicopter, this usually includes their first introduction to  power checks (also called health indicator (HIT) checks,  engine monitoring, etc.). Power checks allow the pilot to  determine if the engine or engines is/are producing rated  power before takeoff. Usually, power checks are a function  of some type of maintenance program to extend the service  time of the powerplant. Turbine engines are very expensive,  so any method to safely extend the service time of the power  plant is welcome. If the power check values are not within  limits or change from one day to the next by a large margin,  the pilot should write up the check as a discrepancy and bring  it to the attention of maintenance. It is always cheaper to fix  a problem before it becomes an airborne emergency. Turbine  engines can have a failure mode of disintegrating and sending  out parts at high enough speeds to penetrate the other engine,  fuel lines, driveline components, and compartments. A poor  power check value can be an indication of a worn engine or  one that may be ready to fail.  

The student should be thoroughly trained to observe  temperature and torque limitations. Additionally, the student  should be trained how to determine which limitation is for  that time and place, as well as why.  

# Floats, Wheeled Landing Gear, or Ski  Transitions  

When transitioning a student to a helicopter equipped with  floats, wheeled landing gear, or skis, the instructor should  carefully plan the course of instruction to fully encompass  Airspace  

# Objective  

The purpose of this lesson is for the student to learn how to fly from a nontowered airport, through Class G and  Class E airspace, to a towered airport.  

# Content  

1. Scenario:  

2. Possible Hazards/Considerations:

   • Ground-based obstructions/hazards

   • Visibility/Ceiling requirements for:

     Class G

     Class E

     Class D

   • Wind conditions

   • Engine-out procedures

   • Communication and equipment requirements for:

     Class G

     Class E

     Class D

   • Airport traffic

 3. Fly the Scenario  

4. Postflight review: 

   This review should include a dialogue between the instructor pilot and the student or transitioning pilot 

   encompassing the flight scenario. Generally, the instructor pilot should lead the discussion with questions that 

   generate reflective thinking on how the overall flight went. The instructor pilot should use this to assist in evaluating 

   the student or transitioning pilot’s assessment skills, judgment, and decision-making skills. Typically, the discussion 

   should begin with student self-critique; the instructor pilot enables the student to solve the problems and draw 

   conclusions. Based on this analysis, the student and instructor pilot should discuss methods for improvement, 

   even on those items that were considered successful.  

# Postflight Discussion  

• Review what was covered during this phase of training. • If any problems were encountered during the flight tasks, correct or, if necessary, retrain for that    particular task(s). • Discuss what will be covered on the next lesson plan.  

# Figure 15-4.   Sample lesson plan.  

the procedures contained in the Rotorcraft Flight Manual  (RFM) for the helicopter being used.  

# Floats  

Fixed inflated type floats must be checked daily for inflation  and may limit the airspeeds and maneuvering capability of  the helicopter. Water landings can be uneventful or very  demanding, depending on the winds and waves. Autorotations  to the water can be very challenging if the water is smooth  and calm. Rotor wash disturbs the water surface, which can  make hovering over a position most difficult. Should the pilot  need to shut down on floats and then restart, uncontrolled  turning should be expected until sufficient rpm is gained to  allow heading control with the pedals.  

A pilot flying over the water should be taught to carefully  observe the water’s surface for wind direction and swell  parameters. Due to the lack of reference points, navigation  over large bodies of water is somewhat different than land  navigation. For example, the wind direction does not usually  vary as much over land due the lack of surface friction, but  thunderstorms tend to form more at night over larger bodies  of water, which makes the occurrence of fog more likely.  Haze can also be dense enough to restrict visibility to 3 miles.  

Many helicopters sit somewhat low in the water on fixed  floats, so tail rotor clearance can be a hazard in very small  waves. Landing close to boats or ships exposes the helicopter  to ropes, lines, and cranes on the larger vessels. All of these  can constitute deadly hazards to a helicopter and should be  discussed in detail.  

Work on floats involves flight over water so the crew and  passengers must have life jackets. The pilot must ensure the  passengers are equipped with life jackets and briefed on how  the equipment works and what the best course of action is in  the event they are required to land in water.  

Discuss with the student that water operations are much more  demanding on the maintenance crews because of corrosion  control, to include engine washes are major items. In most  operations near salt water, the pilot performs a daily engine  wash, while the maintenance crew performs more extensive  washes periodically.  

# Wheeled Landing Gear  

Wheeled landing gear must be inflated properly to prevent  ground resonance. If the wheels are retractable, the pilot must  follow a checklist to ensure gear extension before landing.  Usually, if the gear retracts, there are emergency landing gear  extension procedures for the student to learn. There may be  maximum airspeeds for landing gear operation, retraction,  and extension.  

# Skis  

Skis, or snow pads, settle into the snow over time and become  almost glued to the surface. Skis also slip under tree limbs  and other obstructions very easily. Always ensure the skis or  snow pads are free of the surface before lifting all of the way  to a hover. Snow operations include other hazards, such as  whiteouts and loss of the horizon, as the snow blends into a  white sky. Snow can hide depressions and in itself be unstable  if near a high area. Always maintain flight rpm until you are  certain that the snowy surface fully supports the helicopter  and is stable under the added weight of the helicopter.  

# External Loads  

14 CFR part 133 and Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC ) 133-1 provide information  for rotorcraft external-load operations. No person subject  to this part may conduct rotorcraft external-load operations  within the United States without a Rotorcraft External-Load  Operator Certificate issued by the FAA in accordance with  14 CFR part 133, section 133.17. Additionally, the pilot  must have the exclusive use of at least one rotorcraft that—  

1.	 Was type certificated under and meets the requirements  of 14 CFR part 27 or 29 (but not necessarily with  external-load-carrying attaching means installed) or of  

14 CFR part 21, section 21.25, for the special purpose  of rotorcraft external-load operations; 2. 	 Complies with the certification provisions in 14 CFR  part 133, subpart D that apply to the rotorcraft-load  combinations for which authorization is requested;  3. 	 Has a valid standard or restricted category airworthiness  certificate.  

For the purposes of this section, a person has exclusive use  of a rotorcraft if he or she has the sole possession, control,  and use of it for flight, as owner, or has a written agreement  (including arrangements for the performance of required  maintenance) giving him or her that possession, control, and  use for at least six consecutive months.  

# Personnel  

The pilot must hold a current commercial or airline  transport pilot certificate issued by the FAA, with a rating  appropriate for the rotorcraft as prescribed in 14 CFR part  133, section 133.19. One pilot, who may be the applicant,  must be designated as chief pilot for rotorcraft external-load  operations. The applicant also may designate qualified pilots  as assistant chief pilots to perform the functions of the chief  pilot when the chief pilot is not readily available. The chief  pilot and assistant chief pilots must be acceptable to the  FAA and each must hold a current Commercial or Airline  Transport Pilot Certificate, with a rating appropriate for the  rotorcraft as prescribed in 14 CFR section 133.19.  

The holder of a Rotorcraft External-Load Operator Certificate  must report any change in designation of chief pilot or  assistant chief pilot immediately to the FAA certificate- holding office. The new chief pilot must be designated and  must comply with 14 CFR section 133.23, within 30 days  or the operator may not conduct further operations under  the Rotorcraft External-Load Operator Certificate unless  otherwise authorized by the FAA certificate-holding office.  

# Knowledge and Skill  

The applicant, or the chief pilot designated in accordance with  14 CFR part 133, section 133.21(b), must demonstrate to the  FAA satisfactory knowledge and skill regarding rotorcraft  external-load operations. The test of knowledge (which may  be oral or written, at the option of the applicant) covers the  following subjects:  

1. 	 Steps to be taken before starting operations, including  a survey of the flight area. 2. 	 Proper method of loading, rigging, or attaching the  external load. 3. 	 Performance capabilities, under approved operating  procedures and limitations, of the rotorcraft to be used.  

4. 	 Proper instructions of flight crew and ground workers. 5. 	 Appropriate rotorcraft-load combination flight  manual.  

The test of skill requires appropriate maneuvers for each  class requested. The appropriate maneuvers for each load  class must be demonstrated in the rotorcraft as prescribed in  14 CFR part 133, section 133.19. These include:  

1. 	 Takeoffs and landings. 2. 	 Demonstration of directional control while hovering. 3. 	 Acceleration from a hover. 4. 	 Flight at operational airspeeds. 5. 	 Approaches to landing or working area. 6. 	 Maneuvering the external load into the release  position. 7. 	 Demonstration of winch operation, if a winch is  installed to hoist the external load.  

Before attempting external loads, the student must be familiar  with helicopter performance and the procedures outlined in  the RFM. Ensure the student is aware that preflight planning  is not complete until the ground crew is briefed on essential  safety criteria, such as signals and emergency procedures.  Discuss load pickup, en route, and load release procedures  and the fact that operations need to be at an altitude that  ensures the load clears all obstacles. When possible, plan  the route of flight through an area that is not densely  populated. Emphasize the differences in helicopter handling  characteristics for external loads and internal loads.  

# Emergency Procedures  

Instruct the student in emergency load release procedures  and point out that unnecessary overflight of populated areas  should be avoided. Ensure the student is aware that, during  pickup and normal release of a load, the helicopter is usually  operating in the danger area of the height-velocity diagram.  

Depending on the operation and configuration, great care  should be exercised to isolate the external load release from  the radio or intercom transmit button to prevent inadvertent  load release. If at all possible, the student should exercise  the emergency or manual load release system during flight  to build the habit pattern. If the helicopter does not have dual  or mutually accessible emergency cargo release controls,  the instructor should develop a procedure and brief the  student on the emergency actions to be accomplished by  each crewmember in the case of an actual emergency. Some  version of cargo hook arming and safing procedures should  be practiced.  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 Remind the student that all aircraft have blind spots  whether they are in the air or on the ground, and pilots  must maintain a continuous scan to keep the helicopter  clear. •	 During external load training, remind the student that  not only the helicopter needs to clear an obstacle on  takeoff, sufficient altitude must also be attained in  order for the load to clear the obstacle.  •	 Stay close to the controls at all times and always be  ready to take control of the aircraft. Be prepared for  both the expected and the unexpected.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter presented some training techniques and  instructional points that can be used to familiarize the  student with helicopter operations in and around airports.  It also briefly discussed transition of students into turbine  and multiengine helicopters, as well as points to emphasize  during external load training.  

# Practical Examination and  Preparation for Flight Review  

# Introduction  

The instructor must be able to prepare the student for a  practical examination as well as the flight review.  

# Documentation  

Every instructor must have a thorough understanding of  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 61. For instance, 14 CFR part 61, section 61.3, provides  information on certificates, ratings, and authorizations.  Prior to recommending the student pilot for the practical  examination or prior to conducting a flight review, the  student must have documentation of experience and  training requirements. Part 61 also provides regulatory  guidance for the requirements and documentation needed  for the knowledge test (14 CFR section 61.35), practical  test (14 CFR section 61.39), and flight review (14 CFR  section 61.56), as well as other pertinent information.  

#  

#  

#  

#  

#  

#  

Requirements differ; therefore, it is important for the  instructor to become familiar with the prerequisites for the  specific training and test to be conducted. Documentation for  each type of certificate generally includes:  

•	 Current student or pilot certificate, •	 Medical certificate appropriate for the rating sought,  •	 Instructor’s endorsement to take the practical exam, •	 Experience requirements, •	 Airman’s application form, and •	 Photo identification.  

# Preparing the Student  

A student pilot is likely to be anxious and apprehensive  when preparing for the knowledge test, practical exam, and  flight review. Help the student understand the process and  intent of each.  

# Last Training Flight  

The last few training sessions should attempt to mirror  what is to be expected during the actual academic or flight  evaluation. Replicate the evaluation and allow the student  to perform all maneuvers or discuss all subjects without  assistance. This should provide the student with confidence  going into the evaluation.  

Describe the difference between a FAA inspector and  designated pilot examiner (DPE). Remind the student that  each evaluator has different techniques, but that the same  standards apply regardless of the evaluator.  

# Application and Testing Preparation  

Assist the student by walking them through the application  process and explaining what is to be expected at the testing  locations. Questions, such as, how long the test will be,  what to bring, what items they may need to bring are most  common. Several FAA websites are available to help the  student prepare for the exam or flight review process:  

•	 http://www.faa.gov/training testing/ (provides a list  of resources and guides to help the student) •	 http://www.faa.gov/pilots/testing/ (provides testing  information and locations) •	 http://av-info.faa.gov/DesigneeSearch.asp (provides  a directory for Pilot Examiners)  

# Preparation for a Practical Exam  

# Training  

As previously discussed in earlier chapters, the academic and  flight training leading up to this point should have scenarios  included. These scenarios start with basic fundamentals  and develop into more complex and comprehensive  task-integrated scenarios. In addition to teaching specific  maneuvers and knowledge required for the exams, a large  part of ensuring a pilot is ready for pilot-in-command (PIC)  duties is developing the student’s ability to exercise good  judgment and mature decision-making skills.  

A scenario based flight training program should provide the  student with the skills and knowledge necessary to meet or  exceed the standards outlined in the Practical Test Standards  (PTS) found at http://www.faa.gov/pilots/testing for the  rating being sought. The PTS is published by the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish the standards  for the practical test and pilot certification. FAA inspectors  and designated pilot examiners (DPE) conduct practical tests  in compliance with these standards. Flight instructors and  applicants should find these standards helpful during training  and when preparing for the practical test. By incorporating the  PTS into scenario-based instructional programs, instructors  can ensure the student not only meets or exceeds the standards  but understands the practical application of those standards.  

An instructor should not recommend a student for the  practical exam unless the student has demonstrated both  the knowledge and the skills required to meet the PTS. The  instructor should not use the PTS as a training document  because the PTS contains only the minimum standards to  meet to obtain a certificate. Training that only meets the  minimum standard of the PTS is poor training. Instructors  should determine the student’s goals and focus the training  towards those goals, developing training that challenges the  student to exceed the minimum standards.  

# Flight Review  

The flight review is not a test, but rather a mandated  opportunity to receive updated information and instruction  concerning the national airspace system, the aircraft to be  used during the instruction, safety policies, and procedures.  Additionally, the flight review is an instructional service  designed to assess the pilot’s knowledge, skills, and  proficiency. For more in-depth discussion of the conduct  of flight reviews, refer to Conducting an Effective Flight  Review (a downloadable PDF handbook available at www. faa.gov); FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 61-98, Currency and  Additional Qualification Requirements for Certificated Pilots;  and 14 CFR part 61, section 61.56, Certification: Pilots,  Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors. Appendices in  these documents include such items as a sample flight review  plan and checklist, a sample list of flight review knowledge,  maneuvers and procedures, and personal minimums  worksheets.  [Figure 16-1]

Figure 16-2.   Endorsement after successful flight review.  

It should be noted that in a flight review, the two possible  outcomes are a sign-off in the logbook for successful  completion or an opportunity to return and practice more to  regain or sharpen certain aircraft skills. There is no possibility  of failure in a flight review. At the conclusion of a successful  flight review, the logbook of the pilot should be endorsed as  recommended by AC 61-65, Certification: Pilots and Flight  and Ground Instructors.  [Figure 16-2]  

The purpose of the flight review is to provide for an  independent evaluation of pilot skills and aeronautical  knowledge. According to the regulation, it is also intended to  offer pilots the opportunity to design a personal currency and  proficiency program in consultation with a certificated flight  instructor (CFI). In effect, the flight review is the aeronautical  equivalent of a regular medical checkup and ongoing health  improvement program.  

A flight review is an excellent opportunity for an instructor  to review pilot decision-making skills. To get the information  needed to evaluate aeronautical decision-making (ADM)  skills, including risk management, give the pilot multiple  opportunities to make decisions and ask questions about  those decisions. For example, ask the pilot to explain why  the alternate airport selected for the diversion exercise is a  safe and appropriate choice. What are the possible hazards  and what can the pilot do to mitigate them? Be alert to the  pilot’s information and automation management skills as  well. For example, does the pilot perform regular “common  sense cross-checks?” For more ideas on generating scenarios  that teach risk management, visit www.faa.gov.  

In addition to the required maneuvers conducted during  the flight review, flight instructors should also review and  discuss those special emphasis items listed in the flight  instructor PTS.  

# Who Needs a Flight Review?  

Pilots require a flight review every 24 months, with the  following exceptions:  

1.	 A person who has a pilot proficiency check conducted  by an examiner, an approved pilot check airman, or is  in the U.S. Armed Forces, for pilot certificate, rating,  or operating privilege. 2.	 A person who has satisfactorily completed one or more  phases of an FAA-sponsored pilot proficiency award  program. 3.	 A student pilot need not accomplish the flight review  provided that student pilot is undergoing training for  a certificate and has a current solo flight endorsement  as required under 14 CFR part 61, section 61.87. 4.	 A person who has passed the required PIC proficiency  check under 14 CFR part 61, section 61.58, or part  121, 135, or 141. 5.	 A person who holds a current flight instructor  certificate and has satisfactorily completed renewal  of a flight instructor certificate under the provisions  of 14 CFR part 61, section 61.197, need not complete  the one hour of ground training listed under the  requirements of the flight review.  

# Flight Review Requirements  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.56 stipulates that a flight review  must contain at least one hour of ground instruction and one  hour of flight instruction. The instruction must include a  review of the general operating and flight rules of 14 CFR  part 91 and a review of those maneuvers and procedures  that, at the discretion of the instructor giving the review,  are necessary for the pilot to demonstrate the safe exercise  of the privileges of the pilot certificate held.  [Figure 16-3]   Instructors should tailor the review of general operating and  flight rules to the needs of the pilot being reviewed to ensure  the pilot can comply with all regulatory requirements and  operate safely. Flight instructors need to keep in mind that  a flight review can only end with a biennial flight review  endorsement or dual given. There are no failures on a flight  review.  

# Preparation for the Flight Review  

The flight review gives pilots the opportunity to ride with  a flight instructor of their own choosing for an appraisal  of their flying skills and proficiency, and to get further  assistance and guidance in any area(s) in which they are  deficient. Accident rates suggest that, among other things,  some instructors administering flight reviews may not  sufficiently recognize and correct poor pilot technique or  decision-making capabilities. Since the maneuvers and  procedures performed are at the discretion of the instructor  giving the review, it is important that instructors adequately  prepare for the review. The instructor can make the most of  a flight review by beginning with an interview of the pilot  to determine the nature of his or her flying and operating  requirements. Ask the pilot what he or she wishes to refresh or  relearn. This helps the pilot become motivated and to accept  the flight review evaluation. AC 61-98 suggests some of the  elements to consider during this interview. Flight instructors  should take into consideration the typical flight areas of the  flight review pilot and attempt to tailor the review towards  their expected hazardous conditions and maneuvers. For  example, if flights are in high elevations, then particular  attention should be focused on high density altitude flight  planning and mountain flying to include box canyons. Flight  instructors should also be aware of the local accident rate  and causative factors.  

# Model or Type of Helicopter Flown  

For the purposes of giving a flight review, the regulations do  not require an instructor to have any minimum amount of time  in a particular make and model of helicopter. To ensure the  review is safely conducted within the operating limitations of  the helicopter to be used, it is a good idea to be familiar with  the helicopter. An instructor conducting a flight review must  hold a category, class, and, if appropriate, the type rating on  the pilot certificate, as well as a category and class rating on  the flight instructor certificate appropriate to the aircraft in  which the review is to be conducted.  

# Nature of Flight Operations  

An instructor giving a flight review should consider the  type of flying usually done by the pilot before deciding  how to conduct a review. Most pilots may want to review  only emergency procedures, but other pilots may want  to concentrate on areas of operation in which they lack  experience or feel deficient.  

Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 73 (SFAR 73) has  additional requirements for pilots to act as PIC in Robinson  R-22 or R-44 helicopters. To act as PIC in either of these  helicopters, the pilot must complete the flight review in the  specific model helicopter.  

# Recency of Flight Experience  

The instructor should review the pilot’s logbook to determine  total flight time and recency of experience. This allows the  instructor to evaluate the need for particular maneuvers and  procedures in the flight review. Pilots who have not flown in  several years may require an extensive review of the basic  maneuvers and a more extensive review of 14 CFR part 91,  as well as airspace and other operating requirements. More  experienced and current pilots may want to review advanced  Name  Date  Grade of Certificate Certificate No.  Ratings and Limitations  Class of Medical  Date of Medical  Total Flight Time Time in Type  Aircraft to be used: Make and Model N#  Location of Review   1.

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed the instructor’s role in a student pilot’s  preparation for a practical examination. It also outlined  recommended procedures for conducting a flight review.  

# Single-Pilot  Resource Management,  Aeronautical Decision-Making,  and Risk Management  

# Introduction  

The accident rate for helicopters has traditionally been higher  than the accident rate for airplanes, probably due to the  helicopter’s unique abilities to fly and land in more diverse  situations than airplanes. With no significant improvement in  helicopter accident rates for the last 20 years, the Helicopter  Association International (HAI) set the goal of an 80 percent  reduction in helicopter accidents by the year 2016. The  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has joined HAI and  other members of the helicopter community in accepting the  challenge of improving the safety of helicopter operations.  

![](images/b6c2b4a8a1284d09832a8d8eb454dd67f0a07a2daf3a080a50d0c98b0c0e3237.jpg)  

According to the National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) statistics, approximately 80 percent of all aviation  accidents are caused by “pilot error” or the human factor.  [Figure 17-1]  Many of these accidents are the result of the  tendency of instructors to focus flight training on teaching  the student pilot the physical aspects of flying the aircraft  and only enough aeronautical knowledge to pass the written  and practical tests. Today’s instructor must incorporate  aeronautical decision-making (ADM) into flight training.  

ADM includes single-pilot resource management (SRM), risk  management, situational awareness, task management, and  controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) awareness. Ignoring these  safety issues can have fatal results. The flight instructor who  integrates SRM into flight training teaches aspiring pilots how  to be more aware of potential risks in flying, how to clearly  identify those risks, and how to manage them successfully.  

An instructor’s first priority should be the student. Too often  instructors rush through academics, flight planning, and  preflight to get into the helicopter and begin logging time.  This is a very dangerous first impression for the student.  Instructors learn the Law of Primacy, yet so often this is the  first principle violated. The first flight should be preceded  by very thorough preflight planning, encompassing every  facet of aeronautical decision-making. While we do not  want to overwhelm the student, it is very important to instill  a sense of methodical decision-making, ensuring the student  understands that safety should never take a back seat to  “getting off the ground.” What will be the first impression  of a student who is rushed through preflight planning for  the purpose of getting off the ground? If not shown the  proper procedure from the very first flight, students most  likely accomplish only what they remember and what was  first learned. To go backward to earlier steps that were not  discussed or conducted improperly leads to confusion or  rules misinterpreted by the student. We often hear a student  state, “We didn’t check weather last flight or do performance  planning, but today the instructor says it looks marginal.” In  other words, the student is thinking, “I guess we just check  the weather if it looks bad.” This could be the first link in  the accident chain, and a prime example of poor decision- making as a result of poor instructional practices.  

The helicopter instructor should include the student in all  flight decisions made during the course of instruction. By  discussing the mental processes used to determine whether  or not to fly, the student learns SRM, crew resource  management, and human factors from the beginning of  training. It is important for the instructor to model a high  standard of professionalism which provides the student with  a good role model and helps develop safe flying habits from  the start of training.  

During dual instruction, the instructor should practice  good crew resource management (CRM). As the student  approaches solo proficiency, the instructor should begin  discussing what actions and resources the student will have  

![](images/c6a7440ad45374101f78fbab4d0eb6ad614c6e4274c5f8763da67570ba8a3589.jpg)

available during solo flights. Good preflight briefings review  past performances, provide suggestions for improvement,  and define the flight lessons to be demonstrated and  performed during this training period. Performance of any  new maneuvers should be understood by the student prior  to leaving the briefing room.  

An effective instructor of ADM guides the student through  the decision process by:  

• 	 Posing a question or situation that engages the student  pilot in some form of decision-making activity.  •	 Examining the decisions made.  •	 Exploring other ways to solve the problem.  •	 Evaluating which way is best.  

For example, if the student is going to practice simulated  engine failures, prior to flying and then during the debrief, the  instructor might ask questions such as: “Where are you going  to land?” “Why did you pick that place to land?” “Is there a  better choice?” “Which place is the safest?” or “Why?” These  questions force the student to focus on the decision process.  This accelerates the acquisition of improved judgment,  which is simply the decision-making process resulting from  experience. By introducing decision-making opportunities  into routine training lessons, instructors speed up acquisition  of experience, thus enhancing judgment.  

# Origins of ADM and SRM  

For over 25 years, the importance of good pilot judgment, or  ADM, has been recognized as critical to the safe operation  of aircraft, as well as accident avoidance. Motivated by  the need to reduce accidents caused by human factors, the  airline industry developed the first training programs based  on improving ADM. Called crew resource management  (CRM), these programs focused on training flight crews on  the effective use of all available resources: human resources,  hardware, and information supporting ADM to facilitate crew  operation and improve decision-making. The effectiveness of  this training prompted the FAA to incorporate these concepts  into training directed at improving the decision-making of  pilots. It also led to current FAA regulations that require  decision-making be taught as part of pilot training curriculum.  

The effectiveness of ADM training has been validated in  independent studies in which student pilots received ADM  training in conjunction with the standard flying curriculum.  When tested, the pilots who received ADM training made  fewer in-flight errors than those who had not. Contrary to  popular opinion, good judgment can be taught. Building  upon the foundation of conventional decision-making, ADM  enhances the process to decrease the probability of human  error and increase the probability of a safe flight.  

Many of the concepts utilized in CRM have been successfully  applied to single-pilot operations which led to the development  of SRM. Defined as the art and science of managing all  the resources (both onboard the aircraft and from outside  resources) available to a single pilot (prior to and during  flight), SRM ensures the successful outcome of the flight.  As mentioned earlier, this includes ADM, risk management,  situational awareness (SA), task management, and CFIT  awareness.  

SRM is about helping pilots learn how to gather information,  analyze it, and make decisions. It helps the pilot assess  and manage risk accurately and make accurate and timely  decisions. For instance, give the new student tasks such as  checking weather, determining weather sources and there  content, and conduct performance planning for current and  forecast conditions. Having the student perform these vital  tasks is likely to instill confidence and, when reviewed by  the instructor, provide a solid ADM foundation.  

Help the student identify hazards, report them, and explain  why and under which circumstances they are applicable.  After training, the student may not report them to anyone,  but rather acknowledge their existence and make seasoned,  rational risk management decisions concerning those hazards.  This is the essence of risk management. A pilot should  acknowledge hazards, determine risk factors, and develop  risk mitigation plans. For example, a pilot notices a large  rock has surfaced in the hover training area. The pilot should  recognize the rock could cause a dynamic rollover accident.  In this case, the pilot should report the rock to the airport  authority and avoid the area until the rock is removed and the  hole filled. The pilot should also remember the rock can be  a hazard during mowing seasons. During mowing, pieces of  the rock can be ejected from the mower like small missiles,  damaging thin helicopter parts.  

In effect, you lead the student through the risk management  process, which is much easier to comprehend at the planning  table than in the air. At some point in the training, the instructor  should begin to ask the student to evaluate situations, and  determine if hazards are present and what results risk  management analysis would yield. For aeronautical decision- making skills to be gained and developed, conclusions must  be made and results determined. That is called experience.  

# The Decision-Making Process  

The instructor needs to understand the basic concepts of the  decision-making process in order to provide the student with  a foundation for developing ADM skills. It is important to  teach students how to respond to emergency situations, such  as an engine failure, which requires an immediate response  using established procedures with little time for detailed  analysis. This type of decision-making is called automatic  decision-making and is based upon training, experience,  and recognition. Traditional instruction trains students to  react to emergencies, but does not prepare the student to  make decisions requiring a more reflective response through  greater analysis. There is usually time during a flight to  examine any changes that occur, gather information, and  assess risk before reaching a decision. The steps leading to  this conclusion constitute the decision-making process. In  many cases, decision-making is the filtering of options and  accurate perception of the true conditions. For example, if the  weather is at all questionable, cancel the flight and explain to  the student that their lives are worth much more than getting  training done in questionable weather and possibly risking  an accident due to the conditions.  

Instructors can demonstrate decision-making skills through  emergency training, required maneuvers or table discussion.  Too often instructors “check the block;” that is, they have  the student perform a series of tasks–without ever seeing  the student exercise problem-solving skills. Have you ever  participated in an academic evaluation with an evaluator  asking, “What is the emergency procedure for an engine  failure, for a hydraulic failure, for a high engine oil temp  indication…” and so on? What is being evaluated? The  answer is simple—the student’s ability to memorize  emergency procedures and limitations.  

Provide system or mechanical indicators as part of a flight  profile scenario that can be associated with a specific  emergency or maneuver that is likely to be encountered. One  example is teaching students to abort takeoffs. Although quick  stops are taught as to how to stop, aborted takeoffs are rarely  practiced with the judgment factor exercised. Instructors can  evaluate or train this maneuver while evaluating the student’s  decision-making process.  

Instructors should challenge and evaluate the student’s  decision-making abilities. The intent is not to trick the  student or demonstrate your superior knowledge, but rather  to increase student ability to gather information, assess a  situation, determine options, and choose a course of action.  

# Defining the Problem  

The first step in the decision-making process is to define the  problem, which begins with recognizing that a change has  occurred or that an expected change did not occur. A problem  is perceived first by the senses, then is distinguished through  insight and experience. One critical error that can be made  during the decision-making process is incorrectly defining  the problem.  

Teach students to establish scanning or cross-checks. Do not  allow an unusual finding to become a flight distraction, but  do not ignore what may be an abnormal condition.  

For example, a rapidly falling engine tachometer reading  could indicate the engine has failed, and an autorotation  needs to be entered immediately. It could mean the engine  tachometer has failed. The actions to be taken in each of these  circumstances would be significantly different. One requires  an immediate decision based upon training, experience,  and evaluation of the situation; the latter decision is based  upon an analysis. It should be noted that the same indication  could result in two different actions depending upon other  influences.  

Given this set of circumstances, we should immediately  cross-check other instruments to verify our tachometer  reading. By teaching our students to gather, identify and  assess the information quickly we expect them to make the  appropriate decision. In this case, if the engine rpm indication  is decaying, but the rotor rpm is within the normal range, then  the problem is the gauge. If the rotor rpm is decaying, then  it is a power problem. Gathering all available information  in a timely manner is a very important factor in defining the  problem.  

In the first instance, if the engine failed, then the proper action  would be to autorotate. On the other hand, if the rapidly  falling engine tachometer reading was due to a failure of  the engine tachometer, then the engine is still running. The  helicopter is under power, and a landing under power could  be accomplished.  

# Choosing a Course of Action  

After the problem has been identified, the student must  evaluate the need to react to it and determine the actions that  may be taken to resolve the situation in the time available.  The expected outcome of each possible action should be  considered and the risks assessed before selecting a response  to the situation.  

# Implementing the Decision and Evaluating the  Outcome  

Although a decision may be reached and a course of action  implemented, the decision-making process is not complete.  The decision-making process continues, eliminating some  options and recognizing new options as conditions change.  It is important that the instructor teach the student how to  think ahead and determine how the decision could affect  other phases of flight. As the flight progresses, encourage the  student to continue to evaluate the outcome of the decision  to ensure it is producing the desired result.  

# Improper Decision-Making Outcomes  

Pilots sometimes get in trouble not because of deficient basic  skills or system knowledge, but because of faulty decision- making skills. One realistic scenario involves a fuel gauge  suddenly indicating near zero or empty. Should the pilot  land and visually check the fuel tanks in the next safe area  to land, or continue as planned and just consider it a gauge  malfunction? The instructor should be teaching the pilot to  evaluate the risk in landing to check the fuel state visually,  instead of continuing the flight uninterrupted and just hoping  that it is only the gauge system failing. What could be the  consequences if the gauge were correct versus being failed?  

Although aeronautical decisions may appear to be simple or  routine, each individual decision in aviation often defines  the options available for the next decision the pilot must  make and the options, good or bad, they provide. Therefore,  it is important for the instructor to stress to the student that  a poor decision early in a flight can compromise the safety  of the flight at a later time. Emphasize the importance of  making accurate decisions. Good decision-making early in  an emergency provides greater latitude for options later on.  

# FAA Resources  

FAA resources offer the instructor a variety of structured  frameworks for decision-making that provide assistance in  organizing the decision process. These models include but are  not limited to the 3P, the 5P, the OODA, and the DECIDE  models. All these models and their variations are discussed  in detail in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  chapter on aeronautical decision-making.  [Figure 17-2]  

Whatever model is used, the instructor wants to ensure the  student learns how to define a problem, recognize all feasible  options available, choose a course of action, implement the  decision, and evaluate the outcome (continuing the process  if necessary). Remember, there is no one right answer in this  process. Each student is expected to analyze the situation in light  of experience level, personal minimums, and current physical  and mental readiness level, and make his or her own decision.

Figure 17-2.   Teach students that various models of decision-making are used in problem solving.  

# Human Factors  

# Curiosity: Healthy or Harmful?  

Curiosity is another human trait that kills. Airmen should  be taught to control their curiosity until they land unless  they wish to be test pilots and perform the standard risk  management operations prior to the test flight!  

Children tend to reply, “I don’t know” when asked why they  did something foolish because they really do not know that  they succumbed to a burning curiosity about what would  happen if they took the action. Humans are born curious  and are always looking to see what is over the next hill or  wave. That innate drive can make us bored or unhappy with  what we have because we do not know what is “over there.”  Whether it is a new country, planet, or just a different recipe  for a new taste, we are curious explorers.  

Restrained curiosity can be healthy. Spontaneous excursions  in aviation can be deadly. An airman musing “Let’s see how  this works” should not tinker with the object of curiosity while  in the air. Airmen should abide by established procedures until  proper hazard assessment and risk management are complete.  

Pilot curiosity crashes modern aircraft just as it did early  aircraft. A pilot may wonder how much he or she can fly or  haul in one day. That curiosity leads to a personal challenge  that may in turn lead to overloading the machine. The pilot  may think of a method to improve production, but may  neglect to factor in the design criteria for the machine,  leading to unsafe overloads or fatigue. A pilot may decide  not to act upon curiosity about something only after learning  that another pilot’s action stemming from the same curiosity  ended in tragedy.  

Instructors must be aware of not only their own curiosity  but also the attitude and tendencies of their students. The  tone of a student’s question can often be interpreted. For  instance, one student may ask, “Is the maximum weight  limit of this aircraft due to design or power limits?” This is  a question that promotes further discussion or correlation  of the limiting factors. Another student may ask, “You can  exceed the maximum weight limit if you really need to, can’t  you?” This student wants to push the envelope, and his or her  curiosity may not be of a healthy nature. if left unchecked,  curiosity can kill the pilot.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management is a formalized way of dealing with  hazards. It is the logical process of weighing the potential  costs of risks against the possible benefits of allowing those  risks to stand uncontrolled. It is a decision-making process  designed to help the pilot identify hazards systematically,  assess the degree of risk, and determine the best course of  action. Once risks are identified, they must be assessed. The  risk assessment determines the degree of risk (negligible,  low, medium, or high) and whether the degree of risk is worth  the outcome of the planned activity. If the degree of risk is  “acceptable,” the planned activity may then be undertaken.  Once the planned activity is started, consideration must then  be given whether to continue. Pilots must have preplanned,  viable alternatives available in the event the original flight  cannot be accomplished as planned.  

Instructors play a critical role in developing the decision- making skills of new pilots. Observe various levels of and  rates at which students acquire these skills. Some students  seem very aware of their surroundings, and others focus  solely on the task at hand. Additionally, all new pilots lack the  experience base to identify potential hazards (such as a buzz  in the pedals) or the options available to them. Instructors  must share their knowledge and discuss options available to  the student pilot.  

Hazard and risk mitigation are key terms in risk management.  Define those terms for the student:  

•	 Hazard—present condition, event, object, or  circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an  unplanned or undesired event—like an accident. It  is a source of danger. For example, binding in the  antitorque pedals represents a hazard. •	 Risk—the future impact of a hazard that is not  controlled or eliminated. It is the possibility of loss  or injury. The level of risk is measured by the number  of people or resources affected (exposure), the extent  of possible loss (severity), and likelihood of loss  (probability). •	 Mitigation—the effort to reduce loss of life and  property by lessening the impact of disasters through  proper planning and developing and implementing  procedures.  

A hazard can be a real or perceived condition, event, or  circumstance that a pilot encounters. Teaching the student  how to identify hazards, assess the degree of risk they pose,  and determine the best course of action form an important  element of today’s flight training programs. For more  information on risk management, refer the student to the  Risk Management Handbook, FAA-H-8083-2.  

# Assessing Risk  

It is important for the flight instructor to teach the student  how to assess risk. Before the student can begin to assess  risk, he or she must first perceive the hazard and attendant  risk(s). Experience, training, and education help a pilot learn  how to spot hazards quickly and accurately.  

Valuable information for instructors can be found on the  NTSB web site, http://www.ntsb.gov/aviation/aviation. htm. Researching an accident and discussing the events that  preceded it provide a real opportunity for an instructor to  impart knowledge and insight to the new student pilot. Many  accidents are due to the failure of the pilot to properly and/ or quickly assess the risk of a hazard. Additionally, applying  the applicable circumstances that led up to the accident will  aid in building the new pilot’s knowledge base. Associating  the events and circumstances that led to an accident helps to  build the new pilot’s knowledge base.  

Once a hazard is identified, determining the probability  and severity of an accident (level of risk associated with it)  becomes the next step. For example, the hazard of binding  in the antitorque pedals poses a risk only if the helicopter is  flown. If the binding leads to a loss of directional control,  there is a high risk it could cause catastrophic damage to the  helicopter and the passengers. The instructor helps the student  identify hazards and how to deal with them by incorporating  risk assessment into the training program.  

Every flight has hazards and some level of risk associated  with those hazards. It is critical that students are able to:  

•	 Differentiate in advance between a low-risk flight and  a high risk flight. •	 Establish a review process and develop risk mitigation  strategies to address flights throughout the low to high  risk range. •	 Determine low risk versus high risk by being educated  on the primary causes, reactions, and final outcomes  of failures caused by weather and aerodynamics.  

# Using the 3P To Form Good Safety Habits  

As is true for other flying skills, risk management thinking  habits are best developed through repetition and consistent  adherence to specific procedures. The 3P model, while similar  to other methods, offers three good reasons for its use:  

1. 	 It is fairly simple to teach and remember.  2.	 It gives students a structured, efficient, and systematic  way to identify hazards, assess risk, and implement  effective risk controls.  3. 	 Practicing risk management needs to be as automatic  as basic aircraft control.  [Figure 17-3]  

![](images/111075e8155561b99e8180e1dddf903ae1e525ccfd5ea9763c4c2b7aea94f25a.jpg)

perceive, process, and perform functions. For instance, during  a hover power check the predicted value is exceeded. Have  the student first go through the steps determining a course  of action, then follow that course of action with continuous  reassessment. Further examples can be made more complicated  to augment the student’s decision-making ability.  

# Stressors Affecting Decision-Making  

Many factors, or stressors, can increase a pilot’s risk of making  a poor decision that affects the safety of the flight. Stressors  are generally divided into three categories: environmental,  physiological, and psychological.  [Figure 17-4]  Reduction  of identifiable stressors can be seen in the simplification of  instrumentation, clear procedures, and redundant systems.  

![](images/623a6bf50a1180d27a5dceb315a435b6777b4d22c7bbcb449a3c7122965dccb0.jpg)  

To assist the student pilot in using the 3P process, develop  scenarios that use the building block theory. Introduce a simple  circumstance that requires the student to progress through the  By making aviation as simple and predictable as possible, its  stressfulness is reduced. ADM attempts to prevent the effects  of stress and increase flight safety. Discuss stressors with  the student and how stressors affect flight decision-making.  

# Pilot Self-Assessment  

Review the IMSAFE checklist with the student. Stress its  importance as one of the best ways single pilots can mitigate  risk by determining physical and mental readiness for flying.  [Figure 17-5]  

![](images/5289b12c2a7586b4ba9b802f4b415419043d56f90dd1243a4033b67ba1178acd.jpg)  
Figure 17-5.   I’M SAFE Checklist.  

# The PAVE Checklist  

Explain to the student that mitigation of risk begins with  perceiving hazards. By incorporating the PAVE checklist  into preflight planning, the instructor teaches the student  how to divide the risks of flight into four categories: Pilot,  Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures (PAVE).  Discuss with the student how these categories form part of  a pilot’s decision-making process.  [Figure 17-2]  

The PAVE checklist provides the student with a simple way  to remember each category to examine for risk prior to each  flight. Once the student identifies the risks of a flight, he or  she needs to decide whether the risk or combination of risks  can be managed safely and successfully. Stress to the student  that the PIC is responsible for making the decision of whether  or not to cancel the flight. Explain that if the pilot decides to  continue with the flight, he or she should develop strategies  to mitigate the risks.  

Encourage the student to learn how to control the risks by  setting personal minimums for items in each risk category.  Emphasize that these are limits unique to that individual  pilot’s current level of experience and proficiency, and  should be reevaluated periodically based upon experience  and proficiency.  

Incorporate ongoing discussions of hazards, risk assessment,  and risk mitigation into training to reinforce the student’s  decision-making skills.  

# Recognizing Hazardous Attitudes  

As discussed in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, it is not  necessary for a flight instructor to be a certified psychologist,  but it is helpful to be aware of student behavior before and  during each flight. If the instructor notices a hazardous  attitude (which contributes to poor pilot judgment), he or  she can counteract it effectively by converting that hazardous  attitude into a positive attitude.  

Since recognizing a hazardous attitude is the first step  toward neutralizing it, it is important for the student to learn  the hazardous attitudes and the corresponding antidotes.  The antidote for each of the hazardous attitudes should be  memorized so it automatically comes to mind when needed.  [Figure 17-6]  

![Figure 17-6 .  The antidotes to five hazardous attitudes. ](images/b890fada0856357a88225cdb710d56e2ab96b1b94ee9c8ca62a3e474f2c65815.jpg)  

When reading  Figure 17-6 , keep in mind that each hazardous  attitude relates directly to a potential incident or accident.  So many of the regulations we abide by are in response to  an increase of the aviation accident rate. Therefore, discuss  specifics with the student that correlate to each.  

The anti-authority hazardous attitude explains numerous  accidents involving weather-related decisions. We have  ceiling and visibility minimums not just for you, but to allow  other pilots to see and avoid you. Or, that old adage, “I don’t  need my landing light on at night, I can see the lit runway  just fine.” Turn the landing lights on at night so other pilots  can see  you . Each hazardous attitude has an explanation and  an antidote as seen in the figure.  

# Stress Management  

Stress is the body’s response to physical and psychological  demands placed upon it. While a certain level of stress is  necessary to perform optimally, too little stress can have as  much of an adverse affect as too much stress. If the student  is under too little stress, the thinking processes tend to  wander to non-related thoughts and activities. For instance,  the “sterile cockpit” rule (14 CFR part 121, section 121.542)  resulted from numerous accidents where the crew seemed  to exhibit no stress and their attention wondered from their  flight duties. Too much stress and the thinking processes seem  to stagnate, resulting in a sensory overload and subsequent  mental shutdown.  

The causes of student stress can range from poor performance  of flight maneuvers to personal issues unrelated to flying.  Stress is an inevitable and necessary part of life that can add  motivation and heighten an individual’s response to meet a  challenge.  

The effects of stress are cumulative and, if the student  does not cope with them in an appropriate way, they can  eventually add up to an intolerable burden. Performance  generally increases with the onset of stress, peaks, and then  falls off rapidly as stress levels exceed a person’s ability to  cope. At this point, a student’s performance begins to decline  and judgment deteriorates. Complex or unfamiliar tasks are  more subject to the adverse effects of increasing stress than  simple or familiar tasks.  

Stress falls into two broad categories, acute (short term) and  chronic (long term). Acute stress involves an immediate  threat that is perceived as danger. This is the type of stress that  triggers a “fight or flight” response in an individual, whether  the threat is real or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can  cope with acute stress and prevent stress overload. However,  ongoing acute stress can develop into chronic stress.  

Chronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that presents  an intolerable burden, exceeds the ability of an individual  to cope, and causes individual performance to fall sharply.  Unrelenting psychological pressures, such as loneliness,  financial worries, and relationship or work problems can  produce a cumulative level of stress that exceeds a person’s  ability to cope with a situation. When stress reaches this level,  performance falls off rapidly. The instructor should make  the student aware that pilots experiencing this level of stress  are not safe and should not exercise their airman privileges.  

The indicators of excessive stress often show as three types  of symptoms: emotional, physical, and behavioral. Emotional  symptoms may surface as overcompensation, denial,  suspicion, paranoia, agitation, restlessness, or defensiveness.  Physical stress can result in acute fatigue. Behavioral  degradation is manifested as sensitivity to criticism, tendency  to be argumentative, arrogance, and hostility. Instructors  need to learn to recognize the symptoms of stress in students.  

There are several techniques an instructor can suggest to a  student to help manage the accumulation of life stresses and  prevent stress overload. For example, to help reduce stress  levels, suggest the student set aside time for relaxation each  day or maintain a program of physical fitness. To prevent  stress overload, encourage the student to learn to manage  time more effectively to avoid pressures imposed by getting  behind schedule and not meeting deadlines.  

For a more in-depth discussion of stress and ways to  deal with it, see the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, Chapter 16, Aeromedical Factors, and Chapter  17, Aeronautical Decision-Making.  

# Use of Resources  

To make informed decisions during flight operations, a  student must be introduced to and learn how to use all the  resources found inside and outside the cockpit. Since useful  tools and sources of information may not always be readily  apparent, an essential part of ADM training is learning to  recognize these resources. The instructor must not only  identify the resources, but also help the student develop the  skills to evaluate whether there is time to use a particular  resource and the impact its use has upon the safety of flight.  

Remember to point out to your students the most valuable  resource or option as a helicopter pilot is the ability to land  the helicopter almost anywhere. Whether at an airport or any  suitable landing area along the flight path, the option to land  the aircraft is almost always available. Too many fatalities  have occurred when this most basic helicopter option is  overlooked. A controlled landing under power is always  preferable to an emergency power off landing. It is easy to  land in an open field or lot and call for fuel or maintenance  rather than crash and never get the chance again to make  any calls. Getting the helicopter safely on the ground allows  time to process other options without endangering the crew  and/or passengers.  

The assistance of air traffic control (ATC) may be very useful  if a student becomes lost; but in an emergency situation, there  may be no time available to contact ATC.  

Cockpit management is also a key resource for preventing  a potential accident from happening. Students must learn to  manage avionics, computer messages, radios, transponders,  and checklists while flying safely and under all conditions,  VFR, IFR, and at night. Proper management in the cockpit  helps the student to organize and learn to safely multitask.  

# Internal Resources  

Point out to the student that the person in the other seat can  be an important resource even if that person has no flying  experience. When appropriate, passengers can assist with tasks,  such as watching for traffic or reading checklist items aloud.  

Emphasize to the student the importance of verbal  communication. It has been established that verbal  communication reinforces an activity. Touching an object  while communicating further enhances the probability  an activity has been accomplished. For this reason, many  solo pilots read checklists out loud. When they reach a  critical item, they touch the switch or control. For example,  to ascertain the force trim is on, the student can read the  checklist. But, if he or she touches the force trim switch  during the process, the checklist action is confirmed.  

Explain to the student that it is necessary for a pilot to have  a thorough understanding of all the equipment and systems  in the aircraft being flown. Discuss with the student that a  lack of aircraft systems knowledge, for example, can lead  to a tragic error. For instance, if a new pilot is unaware of  the mechanical differences between a direct reading gauge  (wet line) versus a gauge operating from sensors, the student  pilot may not associate the oil residue under the center  console to a loose fitting on the affected gauge. Without  full awareness and understanding of the wet line system,  the student may choose to sidestep the issue, thinking it to  be out of place and of no concern. The instructor’s role in  expanding the student’s knowledge may directly lead to  a correct assessment, evaluation of available options and,  ultimately, a good decision.  

Explain to the student that it is necessary for a pilot to have  a thorough understanding of all equipment and systems in  the aircraft being flown. Lack of knowledge such as whether  the oil pressure gauge is a direct reading or uses a sensor is  the difference between making a good decision or a poor one  that leads to a tragic error.  

Checklists are essential internal resources used to verify the  aircraft instruments and systems are checked, set, and operating  properly. They also ensure proper procedures are performed  when there is a system malfunction or in-flight emergency.  One bad habit is reading a step on the checklist and moving on  without having thoroughly performed the step. Complacency  with the routine can allow us to lose focus on the task at hand.  The result is a failure to complete a step or to skip it entirely.  Either failure may lead to aircraft damage.  

Additionally, students should be taught not just the step  or procedure, but the reason for the step or procedure. In  essence, each step involves an aircraft system or procedure.  The student should be taught why the step is performed, what  indications or system settings are affected and what potential  hazards may occur if the checklist is not properly used. While  instructing, notice if the student is providing verbal response  out of habit, or if that student is actually comprehending and  performing the checks. Verbal response is commonly used  under two-pilot situations; however, many pilots of single- pilot aircraft also verbalize the checks for confirmation.  

Another internal resource is the Pilot’s Operating Handbook  (POH). Instructors should be teaching the student pilot the  contents of the POH, as well as interpreting and validating  the information found within the POH. Stress to the student  that certain emergencies require immediate action without  referencing the POH or checklist. Emphasize to the student  that the POH:  

•	 Is required to be carried on board the aircraft.  •	 Is indispensable for accurate flight planning. •	 Plays a vital role in the resolution of in-flight  equipment malfunctions when time allows.  

Workload management (page 17-11) is also a valuable  internal resource.  

# External Resources  

Discuss with the student the role of air traffic controllers and  flight service specialists, the best external resources during  flight. To promote the safe, orderly flow of air traffic around  airports and along flight routes, ATC provides pilots with  traffic advisories, radar vectors, and assistance in emergency  situations.  

Explain that it is the pilot’s responsibility to make the flight  as safe as possible, but a pilot with a problem can request  assistance from ATC. For example, if a pilot needs to be  given a vector, ATC assists and becomes integrated as part  of the crew. Stress to the student that the services provided  by ATC can not only decrease pilot workload, but also help  pilots make informed in-flight decisions.  

Discuss the role of the Flight Service Station (FSS)/ Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) with the student:  

•	 Air traffic facilities that provide pilot briefing, en route  communications, and visual flight rules (VFR) search  and rescue services; assist lost aircraft and aircraft  

in emergency situations; relay ATC clearances,  originate Notices to Airmen (NOTAM); broadcast  aviation weather and National Airspace System (NAS)  information; receive and process instrument flight  rules (IFR) flight plans; and monitor navigational aids  (NAVAIDs).  

•	 At selected locations, an FSS/AFSS provides En Route  Flight Advisory Service (Flight Watch), issues airport  advisories, and advises Customs and Immigration of  transborder flights.  

•	 Selected FSS/AFSS in Alaska also provide transcribed  weather broadcast (TWEB) recordings and take  weather observations.  

Helicopters often operate in locations where radio reception is  poor or contact with ATC is not possible. Prepare the student  for this likelihood by providing scenarios in which it may be  possible to use other devices or NAVAIDS to communicate.  Cellular phones or satellite phones are of great benefit.  

# Workload Management  

Humans have a limited capacity for information. Once  information flow exceeds the person’s ability to mentally  process the information, any additional information becomes  unattended or displaces other tasks and information already  being processed. Once this situation occurs, only two  alternatives exist: shed the unimportant tasks or perform all  tasks at a less than optimal level. Information overload for  the pilot is like an overloaded electrical circuit; either the  consumption is reduced or a circuit failure is experienced.  [Figure 17-7]  

Teaching a student effective workload management  ensures essential operations are accomplished by planning,  establishing a priority for the tasks, and then placing them in  a sequence that avoids work overload. As the student gains  experience, he or she learns to recognize future workload  requirements and can prepare for high workload periods  during times of low workload.  

It is important for the instructor to model good workload  management techniques. For example, review the appropriate  chart and set radio frequencies well in advance of when  they are needed to reduce workload as the flight nears  the airport. In addition, listen to the Automatic Terminal  Information Service (ATIS), Automated Surface Observing  System (ASOS), or Automated Weather Observing System  (AWOS), if available, and then monitor the tower frequency  or Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF), explaining  to the student that these external resources give a pilot a good  idea of what traffic conditions to expect.  

Another tool of workload management (that complements  the use of these systems) is simple navigation and landmark  referencing. By planning ahead and using visual landmarks,  the student learns to maintain situational awareness and use  these landmarks to prompt a necessary call or to alert the pilot  of upcoming controlled or special use airspace.  

Remind students that checklists should be performed well  in advance so there is time to focus on traffic and ATC  instructions. Emphasize to the student that these procedures  are especially important prior to entering a high density  

![](images/2784dd2535fda0bfe75cc24cdcdfb8379c5972d7a5fc444434491eca9e0fdbd7.jpg)

traffic area, such as Class B airspace. Discuss workload  management with the student:  

1. 	 Recognition of a work overload situation is an  important component of managing workload.  •	 The first effect of high workload: the pilot may be  working harder but accomplishing less.  •	 As workload increases, attention cannot be  devoted to several tasks at one time and the pilot  may begin to focus on one item.  •	 When a pilot becomes task saturated, there is  no awareness of input from various sources,  so decisions may be made on incomplete  information, and the possibility of error increases.  2.	 When a work overload situation exists, a pilot needs to:  

•	 Stop,  •	 Think, •	 Slow down, and •	 Prioritize.  

It is important for the student to understand how to decrease  workload. Encourage him or her to learn how to place a  situation in the proper perspective, remain calm, and think  rationally. Explain that these are the key elements in reducing  stress and increasing the capacity to fly safely. Remind the  student this ability depends upon experience, discipline, and  the training that they are in the process of receiving.  

# Situational Awareness  

Many definitions of situational awareness exist. For  the beginning pilot it is most likely placing a term on a  preexisting, subconscious practice. No two individuals share  exactly the same degree of situational awareness. Some  people seem to be aware of almost everything that is going  on around them, while others seem oblivious to anything  except the single task at hand. As instructors, we try to instill  safety by teaching the student situational awareness through  heightening of their senses and broadening student awareness  before, during, and after flight.  

While there are many techniques and learning tools available,  one of the most commonly used is found in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (PHAK). The PHAK  provides an aviation directed tool that instructors may use  for new pilots: the acronym PAVE. PAVE is composed of  four fundamental risk elements for flight: Pilot, Aircraft,  EnVironment, and External pressures.  

Explain that situational awareness is knowing what is  going on during the flight. Use the monitoring of radio  communications for traffic, weather discussion, and ATC  communication to demonstrate to the student how these  resources enhance situational awareness by helping the pilot  develop a mental picture of what is happening.  

Discuss with the student how maintaining situational  awareness requires an understanding of the relative  significance of all flight-related factors and their future impact  on the flight. When a student understands what is going on  and has an overview of the total operation, he or she is not  fixated on one perceived significant factor. Stress that it  is important not only to know the aircraft’s geographical  location but also to understand what is happening around  it. Provide the student with scenario-based training, which  enhances the student’s ability to maintain situational  awareness and uses all of the skills involved in ADM.  

# Obstacles to Maintaining Situational Awareness  

Explain to the student that fatigue, stress, complacency,  and work overload can cause a pilot to fixate on a single  item perceived as important and reduce overall situational  awareness of the flight. Discuss how a factor contributing to  many accidents is distraction that diverts the pilot’s attention  from monitoring the instruments or scanning outside the  aircraft. NTSB accident records offer flight instructors many  examples of loss of situational awareness that can be used  for training purposes.  

Impress upon the student how easily a minor problem, such  as a gauge that is not reading correctly, can result in an  accident. The pilot diverts attention to the perceived problem  and neglects to properly control the aircraft.  

# Operational Pitfalls  

Operational pitfalls  [Figure 17-8]  are routinely  underemphasized. Instructors have the ability to influence  and impact future generations of aviators through their  instructional techniques and practices. While we frequently  refer to the operational pitfalls as present for most aviation  occupations, we fail to highlight the results of making these  mistakes.  

The NTSB database (http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/query.asp) is one  of the greatest tools available to instructors when discussing  operational pitfalls with new pilots. Conducting queries of  helicopter accidents and incidents provides factual, aviation-  related events that can be directly associated with the specific  pitfalls outlined in  Figure 17-8 .  

For instance, when discussing loss of positional or situational  awareness, a query of the NTSB database presents an  incident that occurred in January 2004 (NTSB Identification:  MIA04CA048). While taxiing a helicopter for an upcoming  early morning flight, the helicopter’s left skid contacted a  

# Operational Pitfalls  

# Peer Pressure  

Poor decision-making may be based upon an emotional response to peers, rather than evaluating a situation objectively.  

# Mind Set  

A pilot displays mind set through an inability to recognize and cope with changes in a given situation.  

# Get-there-itis  

This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a disregard for any  alternative course of action.  

# Duck-Under Syndrome  

A pilot may be tempted to arrive at an airport by descending below minimums during an approach. There may be a belief that  there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or a pilot may not want to admit that the landing cannot be completed  and a missed approach must be initiated.  

# Scud Running  

This occurs when a pilot tries to maintain visual contact with the terrain at low altitudes while instrument conditions exist.  

# Continuing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) in Instrument Conditions  

Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles may occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can  be even more dangerous if the pilot is not instrument rated or current.  

# Getting Behind the Aircraft  

This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant state of surprise at what happens  next may be exhibited when the pilot is getting behind the aircraft.  

# Loss of Positional or Situational Awareness  

In extreme cases, when a pilot gets behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or situational awareness may result. The pilot may not  know the aircraft’s geographical location, or may be unable to recognize deteriorating circumstances.  

# Operating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves  

Ignoring minimum fuel reserve requirements is generally the result of overconfidence, lack of flight planning, or disregarding  applicable regulations.  

# Descent Below the Minimum En Route Altitude  

The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the en route portion of an IFR flight.  

# Flying Outside the Envelope  

The assumed high performance capability of a particular aircraft may cause a mistaken belief that it can meet the demands  imposed by a pilot’s overestimated flying skills.  

# Neglect of Flight Planning, Preflight Inspections, and Checklists  

A pilot may rely on short- and long-term memory, regular flying skills, and familiar routes instead of established procedures and  published checklists. This can be particularly true of experienced pilots.  

Figure 17-8.  Typical operation pitfalls requiring pilot awareness.  

hedge bush row, causing the helicopter to roll onto its left  side (dynamic rollover). Additional investigation discovered  an expired biennial review.  

This simple, yet costly, error provides the opportunity to  discuss many aviation topics. Was the accident due to lack  of situational awareness or the mindset of the pilot? Perhaps  there was an element of fatigue involved or a perceived sense  of urgency or get-there-itis. Follow-up discussion can include  dynamic rollover and biennial review requirements. This one  example is likely to leave a lasting impression on a new pilot.  

Instructors must take advantage of resources available to  them not only to discuss these topics with new students, but to  instill safety awareness in the minds of new pilots. If a climate  of safety awareness is achieved, perhaps we can reduce the  number of or even eliminate incidents/accidents and needless  fatalities in helicopters with pilots of all experience levels.  

While discussing each pitfall, begin with the classic  behavioral traps, into which pilots have been known to fall,  that lead to accidents. Talk about the tendency of pilots,  particularly those with considerable experience, who always  try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and  meet schedules. Warn the student that the desire to meet these  goals can have an adverse effect on safety and contribute to  an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful  conditions. Encourage the student to learn how to identify  and eliminate these operational pitfalls.  [Figure 17-8]  

An instructor must develop the student’s awareness of  and teach the students how to avoid operational pitfalls by  ensuring effective ADM training is given.  [Figure 17-9]  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provided the flight instructor with a review of  ADM and SRM. It also offered recommendations on how  ADM and SRM can be integrated into training  

# Instructor Tips  

•	 NTSB accident records offer many accident/incident  reports that can be tailored to test the student’s ADM  knowledge. •	 A student will attempt to imitate instructor actions.  Do not take shortcuts. Instill safety from the first day.  •	 Questions or situations posed by the instructor must be  open ended (rather than requiring only rote or one-line  responses).

Teetering hinge.  A hinge that permits the rotor blades of a  semirigid rotor system to flap as a unit.  

Translational thrust.  As the tail rotor works in less turbulent  air, it reaches a point of translational thrust. At this point  the tail rotor becomes aerodynamically efficient and the  improved efficiency produces more antitorque thrust.  The  pilot will be able to recognize when the tail rotor has reached  translational thrust because once there is more antitorque  thrust produced, the nose of the helicopter will yaw to the left  (opposite direction of the tail rotor thrust) which will force  the pilot correct with applying right pedal.

Vortex ring state.  A transient condition of downward flight  (descending through air after just previously being accelerated  downward by the rotor) during which an appreciable portion  of the main rotor system is being forced to operate at angles  of attack above maximum.
