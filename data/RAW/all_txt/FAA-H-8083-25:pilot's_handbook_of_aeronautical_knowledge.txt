# Preface  

The Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge provides basic knowledge that is essential for pilots. This handbook introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot training. Except for the Codeof Federal Regulations pertinent to civil aviation,mostof the knowledge areas applicable to pilot certification are presented. This handbook is useful to beginning pilots, as well as those pursuing more advanced pilot certificates.  

Occasionally the word “must? or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to,interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). The AIM is available online at www.faa.gov. The current Flight Standards Service airman training and testing material and learning statements for all airman certificates and ratings can be obtained fromwww.faa.gov.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-25A, Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, dated 2008.  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from www.faa.gov.

# Chapter ntroduction To Flying  

# Introduction  

The Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge provides basic knowledge for the student pilot learning to fly, as well as pilots seeking advanced pilot certification. For detailed information on a variety of specialized flight topics, see specific Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) handbooks and Advisory Circulars (ACs).  

This chapter offers a brief history of flight, introduces the history androle of theFAAincivil aviation,FAA regulations and standards, government references and publications, eligibility for pilot certificates, available routes to flight instruction, the role of the Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) and Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) in flight training, Practical Test Standards (PTS), and new, industry-developed Airman Certification Standards(ACS) framework that will eventually replace the PTS.  

# History of Flight  

From prehistoric times,humans have watched the flight of birds, andlonged to imitate them, but lacked the power to do so.Logic dictated that if the small muscles of birds can lift them into the air and sustain them,then thelarger muscles of humans should be able to duplicate the feat.Nooneknew about the intricate mesh of muscles, sinew, heart, breathing system, and devices not unlike wing flaps, variable-camber and spoilers of the modern airplane that enabled a bird to fly.Still,thousands of years and countless lives were lost in attempts to fly like birds.  

The identity of the first “bird-men"who fitted themselves with wings andleapt off of cliffs in an effort tofly are lost in time,but each failure gave those who wished to fly questions thatneededtobeanswered.Wherehadthewingflappers gone wrong? Philosophers, scientists, and inventors offered solutions,but no one could add wingsto thehumanbody and soar like a bird. During the 1500s, Leonardo da Vinci filled pages of his notebooks with sketches of proposed flyingmachines,but most of his ideas were flawed because he clung to the idea of birdlike wings.[Figure 1-l] By 1655, mathematician, physicist, and inventor Robert Hooke concluded that the human body does not possess thestrength to power artificial wings.He believed human flight would require some form of artificial propulsion.  

The quest for humanflight led some practitioners in another direction. In 1783, the first manned hot air balloon, crafted by Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier, flew for 23 minutes. Ten days later, Professor Jacques Charles flew the first gas balloon. A madness for balloon flight captivated the public's imagination andfor a timeflying enthusiasts turned their expertise to the promise of lighter-than-air flight.But for all itsmajestyinthe air,the balloon was little more than a

Balloons solved the problem of lift,but that was only one of the problems of human flight. The ability to control speed and directioneluded balloonists.The solutionto that problemlay inachild'stoyfamiliartotheEastfor2,0o0years,butnot introduced to the West until the 13 th century—thekite.The kites used by the Chinese for aerial observation,totestwinds for sailing, as a signaling device, and as a toy, held many of the answers to lifting a heavier-than-air device into the air.  

One of the menwhobelieved the study of kites unlocked the secrets of winged flight was Sir George Cayley. Born in England 10 years before the Mongolfier balloon flight, Cayleyspent his84years seekingtodevelopa heavier-than- air vehicle supported by kite-shapedwings./FigureI-2/The “Father of Aerial Navigation, Cayley discovered the basic principles on which the modern science of aeronautics is founded; built what is recognized as the first successful flying model; and tested the first full-size man-carrying airplane

Figure1-2.Glider from 1852 by Sir George Cayley,Britishaviator (1773-1857)  

For the half-century after Cayley's death, countless scientists. flying enthusiasts, and inventors worked toward building a powered flying machine. Men, such as William Samuel Henson, who designed a huge monoplane that was propelled by a steam engine housed inside thefuselage,and Otto Lilienthal, who proved human flight in aircraft heavier than air was practical, worked toward the dream of powered flight AdreamturnedintorealitybyWilbur andOrvilleWrightat Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903.  

The bicycle-building Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio, had experimented for 4 years with kites, their own homemade wind tunnel, and different engines to power their biplane. One of their great achievements in flight was proving the value of the scientific, rather than a build-it-and-see approach. Their biplane, The Flyer, combined inspired design and engineering with superior craftsmanship.[Figure 1-3] By the afternoon of December 17th, the Wright brothers had flown a total of 98 seconds on four flights. The age of flight had arrived.  

# History of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  

During the early years of manned flight, aviation was a free for all because no government body was in place to establish policies or regulate and enforce safety standards. Individuals were free to conduct flights and operate aircraft with no government oversight.Most of the early flights were conducted for sport.Aviationwas expensive andbecamethe playground ofthewealthy.Sincetheseearly airplaneswere small, many people doubted their commercial value. One group of individuals believed otherwise and they became the genesis for modern airlinetravel.  

P. E. Fansler, a Florida businessman living in St. Petersburg, approached Tom Benoist of the Benoist Aircraft Company in St. Louis, Missouri, about starting a flight route from St.  

![](images/c48a391f15040b292cd15a2e5403259b45cd17ed4fb11fd351c7de96cfce0f50.jpg)  
Figure1-3.First flightby the Wright brothers  

Petersburg across the waterway to Tampa.Benoist suggested usinghis"SafetyFirst”air boat and the two men signed an agreement for what would become the first scheduled airline in the United States.The first aircraft was delivered to St. Petersburg and made the first test flight on December 31, 1913.[Figure1-4]  

A public auction decided who would win the honor of becoming the first paying airline customer. The former mayor of St. Petersburg, A. C. Pheil, made the winning bid Oof  $\S400.00$  ,which secured his place in history as the first paying airline passenger.  

OnJanuary1,1914,the first scheduled airline flight was conducted.Theflightlengthwas21milesand1asted23 minutes due to a headwind. The return trip took 20 minutes. The line, which was subsidized by Florida businessmen, continued for 4 months and offered regular passage for  $\S5.00$  perpersonor  $\S5.00$  per 100 pounds of cargo. Shortly after the opening of the line,Benoistadded a new air boat that afforded more protection from spray during takeoff and landing. The routes were also extended toManatee,Bradenton,and Sarasota givingfurther credence to the idea of a profitable commercial airline.  

TheSt.Petersburg-TampaAirboat Linecontinued throughout the winter months with flights finally being suspended when the winter tourist industry began to dry up. The airline operated for only 4 months,but1,205 passengers were carried without injury. This experiment proved commercial passenger airline travel was viable  

TheadventofWorldWarIofferedtheairplaneachance to demonstrate its varied capabilities. It began the war as a reconnaissance platform, but by 1918, airplanes were being

Figure1-4.Benoistairboat  

mass produced to serve as fighters,bombers,trainers,as well as reconnaissance platforms.  

Aviation advocates continued to look for ways to use airplanes.Airmail service was a popular idea,but the war prevented the Postal Service from having access to airplanes. The War Department and Postal Service reached an agreement in 1918. The Army would use the mail service to train its pilots in flying cross-country. The first airmail flight was conducted on May 15, 1918, between New York and Washington, DC. The flight was not considered spectacular; the pilot becamelost and landed at thewrong airfield.In Augustof1918,the United States Postal Service took control of the airmailroutes andbrought theexistingArmy airmail pilots and their planes into the program as postal employees.  

# TranscontinentalAirMailRoute  

Airmail routes continued to expand until the Transcontinental Mail Route was inaugurated. [Figure 1-5] This route spanned from San Francisco to New York for a total distance of 2,612 miles with 13 intermediate stops along the way. [Figure 1-6] On May 20, 1926, Congress passed the Air Commerce Act, which served as the cornerstone for aviation within the United States. This legislation was supported by leaders in the aviation industry who felt that the airplane could not reach its full potential without assistance from the Federal Government in improving safety.  

TheAir Commerce Act charged theSecretaryof Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules,licensing pilots,certificating aircraft, establishing airways,andoperatingand maintaining aids to air navigation. The Department of Commerce created a new Aeronautics Branch whose primary mission was to provide oversight for the aviation industry.Inaddition,the Aeronautics Branch tookover theconstruction and operation of the nation's systemoflighted airways.The Postal Service,as part of the Transcontinental AirMail Route system,had initiated this system.The

Figure1-6.The transcontinental airmail router an from New York toSanFrancisco.  

Department of Commerce made significant advances in aviation communications, including the introduction of radio beacons as an effective means of navigation  

Built at intervals of approximately 10 miles apart,the standard beacon tower was 51 feet high, and was topped with a powerful rotating light.Below the rotating light,two course lights pointed forward and back along the airway. The course lights flashed a code to identify the beacon'snumber. Thetowerusuallystoodinthecenterofaconcretearrow 70 feet long.A generator shed, where required, stood at the “feather”end ofthe arrow.[Figure1-7]  

# Federal Certification of Pilots and Mechanics  

The Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce began pilot certification with thefirst licenseissued on April 6,1927. The recipient was the Chief of the Aeronautics Branch, William P. MacCracken, Jr. [Figure 1-8] (Orville Wright, who was no longer an active flier, had declined the honor.) MacCracken's license was the first issued to a pilot by a civilian agency of the Federal Government.Some3 monthslater,the Aeronautics Branch issued thefirstFederal aircraftmechaniclicense.  

Equally important for safety was the establishment of a system of certification for aircraft.OnMarch29,1927, the Aeronautics Branch issued the first air worthiness type certificate to the Buhl Airster CA-3,a three-place openbiplane.  

In1934,torecognizethetremendousstridesmadeinaviation andtodisplaytheenhancedstatuswithinthedepartment, the Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce.[Figure1-9/Within this timeframe,theBureau of Air Commerce brought together a group of airlines

Thenin1936,the Bureau of Air Commerce tookover the responsibilities of operating the centers and continued to advance the ATC facilities.ATChascome alongwayfrom the early controllers using maps, chalkboards, and performing mental math calculations in order to separate aircraft along flightroutes.  

# The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938  

In 1938,the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the civil aviation responsibilities to a newly created,independent body, named the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). This Act empowered the CAA to regulate airfares and establish new routes for the airlines to service.  

President Franklin Roosevelt split the CAA into two agencies—the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).Both agencies were still part of theDepartment of Commercebut the CAB functioned independently of the Secretary of Commerce. The role of the CAA was to facilitate ATC,certificationof airmen and aircraft, rule enforcement, and the development of new airways. The CAB was charged with rule making to enhance safety, accident investigation, and the economic regulation of the airlines. Then in 1946, Congress gave the CAA the responsibility of administering the Federal Aid Airport Program.This program was designed to promote the establishment of civil airports throughout the country  

# The Federal Aviation Act of 1958  

Bymid-century,air traffic had increased andjet aircraft had been introduced into the civil aviation arena.A series of mid-air collisions underlined the need for more regulation of the aviation industry. Aircraft were not only increasing in numbers,but were now streaking across the skies at much higherspeeds.The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a new independent body that assumed the roles of the CAA and transferred the rule making authority of the CAB to the newly created Federal Aviation Agency(FAA).Inaddition, theFAAwasgiven completecontrol of the common civil- military system of air navigation and ATC.Themanwho wasgiven thehonor ofbeingthefirst Administrator of the FAAwasformerAirForceGeneralElwoodRichard"Pete" Quesada. He served as the administrator from 1959-1961. [Figure1-1o]  

# Department of Transportation (DoT)  

OnOctober 15,1966,Congress established the Department of Transportation (DOT), which was given oversight of the transportation industry within the United States.Theresult was a combination of both air and surface transportation. Its mission was and is to serve the United States by ensuring a fast, safe,efficient, accessible, and convenient transportation system meeting vital national interests and enhancing the qualityoflifeoftheAmericanpeople,then,now,andinto  

![](images/5e3feadcd2f3068824452c274717842569025401664baa86fc054fb8ad058621.jpg)

the future. The DOT began operation on April 1, 1967. At this same time,theFederal Aviation Agency was renamed to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  

TheroleoftheCABwasassumedbythenewlycreated National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB),whichwas charged with the investigation of all transportation accidents within the United States.  

As aviation continued togrow,theFAA took on additional duties and responsibilities.With the highjacking epidemic of the1960s,the FAA was responsible for increasing the security duties of aviation both on the ground and in the air. After September 11,2001,the duties were transferred to a newly created body called the Department of Homeland Security(DHS).  

With numerous aircraft flying in and out of larger cities, the FAAbegan to concentrate on the environmental aspect of aviationby establishing andregulating the noisestandards of aircraft.Additionally,in the 1960 s and 1970 s,theFAA began to regulate high altitude(over500feet)kiteandballoon flying.In1970,more duties were assumed by theFAA in the addition of a new federal airport aid program and increased responsibility for airportsafety.  

# ATCAutomation  

By the mid-1970s,the FAA had achieved a semi-automated ATC system based on a marriage of radar and computer technology.By automating certain routine tasks,the system allowed controllers to concentrate more efficiently on the vital task of providing aircraft separation. Data appearing directly on the controllers’ scopes provided the identity, altitude, and groundspeed of aircraft carrying radar beacons. Despite its effectiveness,this system required enhancement to keep pace with the increased air traffic of the late 1970s. Theincreasewas dueinpart to the competitive environment createdbytheAirlineDeregulationActof 1978.Thislaw phased out CAB's economic regulation of the airlines, and CAB ceased to exist at the end of 1984  

To meet the challenge of traffic growth,the FAA unveiled the National Airspace System(NAS)PlaninJanuary 1982.The new plan called for more advanced systems for en route and terminal ATC,modernized flight service stations,and improvements in ground-to-airsurveillance and communication.  

# The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization(PATCO)Strike  

While preparing the NAS Plan, the FAA faced a strike by key members of its workforce. An earlier period of discord between management and the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) culminated in a 1970“sickout"by3,000controllers.Although controllers subsequently gained additional wage and retirement benefits, another period of tension led to an illegal strike in August 1981. The government dismissed over 11,000 strike participants and decertified PATCO. By the spring of 1984, theFAAended thelast of thespecial restrictions imposed to keep the airspace system operating safely during the strike.  

# The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978  

Until 1978,the CAB regulated many areas of commercial aviation suchasfares,routes,andschedules.The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978,however,removedmanyof these controls, thus changing the face of civil aviation in the UnitedStates.After deregulation,unfettered free competition usheredin a newer a in passenger air travel.  

TheCAB had three main functions:to award routes to airlines,to limit the entry of air carriers into new markets, and to regulate fares for passengers.Much of theestablished practicesofcommercialpassengertravelwithintheUnited StateswentbacktothepoliciesofWalterFolgerBrown,the United States Postmaster General during the administration of President Herbert Hoover.Brown had changed the mail payments system to encourage the manufacture of passenger aircraft instead of mail-carrying aircraft.Hisinfluence was crucial in awarding contracts andhelped create four major domestic airlines: United, American, Eastern, and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA).Similarly, Brown had also helped give Pan American a monopoly on international routes.  

The pushto deregulate,or atleast to reform the existing laws governing passenger carriers,was accelerated by President Jimmy Carter,who appointed economist and former professor Alfred Kahn, a vocal supporter of deregulation, to head the CAB.Asecondforce to deregulate emerged from abroad.In1977,FreddieLaker,a British entrepreneur who owned Lake r Airways,created the Skytrain service,which offered extraordinarily cheapfares for transatlantic flights. Laker's offerings coincided with a boom in low-cost domestic flights as the CAB eased some limitations on charter flights (i.e.,flights offered by companies that do not actually own planes but leased them from the major airlines). The big air carriers responded by proposing their own lower fares. For example,American Airlines, the country's second largest airline,obtained CAB approval for“SuperSaver”tickets.  

Alloftheseeventsprovedtobefavorableforlarge-scale deregulation.InNovember1977,Congress formally deregulated air cargo. In late 1978, Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, legislation that had been principally authored by Senators Edward Kennedy and HowardCannon.[Figure1-il]Therewasstiffoppositionto the bill from the major airlines who feared free competition. from labor unions who feared non-union employees, and from safety advocates who feared that safety would be sacrificed. Public support was,however, strong enough to pass the act. The act appeased the major airlines by offering generous subsidies and pleased workers by offering high unemployment benefits if theylost their jobs as a result. The most important effect of the act,whose laws were slowly phased in, was on the passenger market.For the first time in 40years,airlines could enter the market or(from1981) expand their routes as they saw fit.Airlines(from1982) also had full freedom to set theirfares.In1984,theCAB was finally abolished since its primary duty of regulating the airlineindustrywasnolongernecessary.  

# TheRoleoftheFAA  

# The Code of Federal Regulations(CFR)  

The FAA is empowered by regulations to promote aviation safety and establish safety standards for civil aviation.The FAA achieves these objectives under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is the codification of the general and permanent rules published by the executive departments andagencies of theUnited States Government.The regulations are divided into 5 O different codes,calledTitles, that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. FAA regulations are listed under Title 14, “Aeronautics and Space,”which encompasses all aspects of civil aviation from howtoearn apilot's certificate to maintenance of an aircraft. Title 14 CFR Chapter 1, Federal Aviation Administration, is broken down into subchapters A through N as illustrated inFigure1-12.  

For the pilot, certain parts of  $14~\mathrm{CFR}$  aremorerelevant than others. During flight training, it is helpful for the pilot to become familiar with the parts and subparts that relate

to flight training and pilot certification.Forinstance,14 CFR part 61 pertains to the certification of pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors. It also defines the eligibility, aeronautical knowledge, and flight proficiency, as well as training and testing requirements for each type of pilot certificate issued.14 CFRpart 91 provides guidance in the areas of general flight rules, visual flight rules (VFR), and instrument flight rules(IFR),while14 CFRpart 43covers aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding andalterations.  

# Primary Locations of the FAA  

The FAA headquarters are in Washington,DC,and thereare nine regional offices strategically located across theUnited States. The agency's twolargest field facilities are the Mike Mon ron ey Aeronautical Center(MMAC)inOklahoma City, Oklahoma, and the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Home to FAA training and logistics services,the MMAC provides a number of aviation safety-related and business support services.The W J HTC is the premier aviation research and development and test and evaluation facility in the country. The center's programs include testing and evaluationin ATC, communication, navigation, airports, aircraft safety, and security.Furthermore,theWJHTC is activeinlong-range development of innovative aviation systems and concepts development of new ATC equipment and software,and modification of existing systems and procedures.  

# Field Offices  

Flight Standards Service  

WithintheFAA,the Flight Standards Service promotes safe air transportation by setting the standards for certification and oversight of airmen, air operators, air agencies, and designees.It also promotes safety of flight of civil aircraft and air commerce by:  

Accomplishing certification,inspection,surveillance, investigation,andenforcement. Setting regulations and standards Managing the system for registration of civil aircraft and all airmen records.  

The focus of interaction between Flight Standards Service and the aviation community/general public is the Flight Standards District Office(FSDO)

TheFAA has approximately 80 F SDOs.[Figure1-13]These offices provide information and services for the aviation community. FSDOphone numbers arelisted in the telephone directory under Government Offices, DOT, FAA.Another convenient method of finding a local office is touse the FSDOlocator available at:www.faa.gov/about/office_org/ field_offices/fsdo.  

In addition to accident investigation and the enforcement of aviation regulations,the FS DO is also responsible for the certification and surveillance of air carriers, air operators, flight schools/training centers, and airmen including pilots and flight instructors.Each FS DO is staffed by Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs) who play a key role in making the nation's aviation system safe.  

# Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI)  

The AS Is administer and enforce safety regulations and standards for the production, operation, maintenance, and/ or modification of aircraft used in civil aviation. They also specialize in conducting inspections of various aspectsofthe aviation system, such as aircraft and parts manufacturing, aircraft operation, aircraft airworthiness, and cabin safety. ASIs must complete a training program at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City,Oklahoma,which includes airman evaluation and pilot testing techniques and procedures.ASIs also receive extensive on-the-job training and recurrent trainingona regularbasis.The FAA has approximately 3,700 inspectors located in its FSDO offices. All questions concerningpilot certification(and/or requestsfor other aviation information or services) should be directed to the localFSDO.  

# FAASafetyTeam(FAASTeam)  

The FAA is dedicated to improving the safety of United States civilian aviation by conveying safety principles and practices through training, outreach, and education. The FAA

Figure1-13.Atlanta Flight Standards District Office(FSDO)  

SafetyTeam(FAASTeam)exemplifies this commitment. The FA AS Team has replaced the Aviation Safety Program (ASP),whose education of airmen on all types of safety subjects successfully reduced accidents.Its success led to its demise because the easy-to-fix accident causes have been addressed. To take aviation safety one step further, Flight Standards Service created the FA AS Team,whichisdevoted to reducing aircraft accidents by using a coordinated effort tofocusresourcesonelusiveaccidentcauses.  

Each of the FAA's nine regions has a Regional FAASTeam Office dedicated to this newsafety program and managed by the Regional FAASTeamManager (RFM).TheFAASTeam is “teaming" up with individuals and the aviation industry to create a unified effort against accidents and tip the safety culture in the right direction. To learn more about this effort to improve aviation safety, to take a course at their online learning center, ortojoin the FAASTeam,visit their website atwww.faasafety.gov.

# Handbooks  

Handbooks are developed to provide specific information about a particular topic that enhances training or understanding The FAA publishes avariety of handbooks that generally fall into three categories:aircraft,aviation,and examiners and inspectors.[Figure1-15]Thesehandbooks canbepurchased from the Superintendent of Documents or downloaded atwww. faa.gov/regulations policies. Aviation handbooks are also published by various commercial aviation companies.Aircraft flight manuals commonly called Pilot Operating Handbooks (POH) are documents developed by the airplane manufacturer, approved by the FAA, and are specific to a particular make andmodel aircraft by serial number.This subject is covered in greater detail in Chapter 8, “Flight Manuals and Other Documents,"of thishandbook.[Figure1-16]  

# Advisory Circulars (ACs)  

An AC is an informational document that the FAA wants to distributetothe aviation community.This can be in the form  

# Aeronautical Information Manual (AiM)  

TheAeronautical Information Manual is designed to provide the aviation community with basic flight information and ATC procedures for use in theN AS of the United States.It also contains the fundamentals required in order to fly in the UnitedStatesNAS，including items of interest to pilots concerning health/medicalfacts,factors affecting flight safety，etc.  

# Aircraft Flying Handbooks (by category)  

The Aircraft Flying Handbooks are designed as technical manuals to introduce basic pilot skills and knowledge that are essential for piloting aircraft. They provide information on transition to other aircraft and the operation of various aircraftsystems.  

# AviationInstructor'sHandbook  

The Aviation Instructor's Handbook provides the foundation for beginning instructors to understand and apply the fundamentals of instructing.This handbook also provides aviation instructors with up-to-date information on learning andteaching,and how to relate this information to the task of conveying aeronautical knowledge and skills to students. Experienced aviation instructors also find the new and updated information useful for improving their effectiveness in training activities.  

# Instrument Flying Handbook  

The Instrument Flying Handbook is designed for use by instrument flight instructors and pilots preparing for instrumentratingtests.Instructorsfindthishandbooka valuable training aid as it includes basic reference material for knowledge testing and instrument flight training.  

# Instrument Procedures Handbook  

The Instrument Procedures Handbook is designed as a technicalreferenceforprofessionalpilotswhooperate under IFR in theN AS and expands on information contained intheInstrumentFlyingHandbook

ACs provide a single, uniform, agency-wide system that the FAA uses to deliver advisory material to FAA customers, industry, the aviation community, and the public. An AC maybe needed to:  

Provide an acceptable,clearly understood method fon complyingwith a regulation  

![](images/4d0b940f764be72c71aa0b4cfe0b9a29116882753eb66705e92fa0e12fd55cc0.jpg)

There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42C. The first part of the number identifies the subject matter area of the AC and corresponds to the appropriate 14 CFR part. For example, an AC on "Certification: Pilots and Flight and GroundInstructors"isnumberedasAC61-65E.SinceACs are numbered sequentially within each subject area,the second part of the number beginning with the dash identifies this sequence. The third part of the numberis aletter assigned by the originating office and shows the revision sequenceif an AC is revised.The firstversion of an AC does not have a revision letter. In Figure 1-17, this is the fifth revision, as designatedbythe"E.'  

# Flight Publications  

TheFAA,in concert with other government agencies orchestrates the publication and changes to publications that arekey tosafeflight.Figure1-18 illustratessome publications a pilot may use.

# Pilot and Aeronautical Information NoticestoAirmen(NOTAMs)  

NoticestoAirmen,orNOTAMs,aretime-criticalaeronautical information either temporary in nature or not sufficiently known in advance to permit publication on aeronautical chartsorinotheroperationalpublications.Theinformation receives immediate dissemination via the National Notice to Airmen(NOTAM)System.NOTAMs contain current notices to airmenthat are considered essential to the safety of flight as well as supplemental data affecting other operational publications.There are many different reasons that NOT AMs areissued.Following are some of those reasons:  

Hazards, such as air shows, parachute jumps, kite flying,and rocket launches Flights by important people such as heads of state Closedrunways Inoperable radio navigational aids Military exercises with resulting airspace restrictions Inoperable lights on tall obstructions Temporary erection of obstacles near airfields Passage of flocks of birds through airspace (a NOTAM in this category is known as a BIRDTAM) Notifications of runway/taxiway/apronstatuswith respect to snow,ice, and standing water (a SNOWTAM)  

Notification of an operationally significant change in volcanic ash or other dust contamination(anASHTAM) Software code risk announcements with associated patches to reduce specific vulnerabilities  

NOTAMinformationisgenerallyclassifiedintofour categories:NOTAM(D)or NOT AMs that receive distant dissemination,distant and Flight DataCenter (FDC) NOTAMs,Pointer NOTAMs,and Military NOTAMs pertaining tomilitary airports or NAVAIDs that are part of the NAS.NOT AMs are available through Flight Service Station (FSS),Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS), privatevendors,and many online websites.  

# NOTAM(D)Information  

NOTAM(D)information is disseminated for allnavigational facilities that are part of the NAS, and all public use airports, seaplane bases, and heliports listed in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory). NOTAM (D) information now includes such data as taxiway closures, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and airport lighting aids that do not affect instrument approach criteria, such as visual approach slope indicator (VASI). All D NOTAMs are required to have one of the following keywords as the first part of the text: RWY, TWY, RAMP, APRON,AD,OBST,NAV,COM, SVC,AIRSPACE,(U),or(O).[Figure1-19]  

FDCNOTAMs  

FDC NOTAMs are issued by the NationalFlight Data Center and contain information that is regulatory in nature pertaining to flight including, but not limited to, changes to charts, procedures, and airspace usage. FDC NOTAMs refer toinformation that is regulatoryin nature and includes thefollowing:  

InterimIFR flight procedures: 1.Airway structure changes 2. Instrument approach procedure changes (excludes Departure Procedures (DPs)and Standard Terminal Arrivals(STARs) Airspace changes in general 4.  Special instrument approach procedure changes Temporary flight restrictions (discussed in Chapter 15): 1. Disaster areas 2. Special events generating a high degree of interest 3. Hijacking  

Flight restrictions in the proximity of the President and other parties 14 CFR part 139 certificated airport condition changes Snow conditions affecting glide slope operation Air defense emergencies Emergency flight rules Substitute airwayroutes Special data U.S. Government charting corrections Laser activity  

NOT AM Composition

NOT AM Dissemination and Availability  

Thesystemfor disseminating aeronautical information is made up of two subsystems:theAirmen's Information System (AIS) and the NOTAM System.The AIS consists of charts and publications and is disseminated by thefollowing methods:  

Aeronautical charts depicting permanent baseline data:  

IFR Charts En route High Altitude Con term inou sU.S., En route Low Altitude Con term inou sU.S.,Alaska Charts, and Pacific Charts U.S. Terminal Procedures—Departure Procedures (DPs),Standard Terminal Arrivals(STARs)and Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) VFR ChartsSectional Aeronautical Charts,Terminal AreaCharts(TAC),andWorldAeronauticalCharts (WAC)  

Flight information publications outlining baseline data:  

Notices toAirmen(NTAP)—Published bySystem Operations Services, System Operations and Safety. Publications,every28 days) Chart Supplement U.S.(formerly Airport/Facility Directory) Pacific Chart Supplement Alaska Supplement AlaskaTerminal Aeronautical Information Manual(AIM)  

NOTAMs are available in printed form through subscription from the Superintendent of Documents,fromanFSS,or online at PilotWeb (www.pilotweb.nas.faa.gov),which provides access to current NOT AM information.Local airport NOTAMs canbe obtained online from various websites. Some examples are www.fltplan.com and www. aopa.org/whatsnew/notams.html.Most sites require a free registration and acceptance of terms but offer pilots updated NOTAMsandTFRs.  

Safety Program Airmen Notification System(SPANS) In 2004,the FAA launched the Safety Program Airmen Notification System(SPANS),anonline event notification system thatprovides timelyandeasy-to-assess seminar and event information notification for airmen.TheSPANS system is taking the place of the current paper-based mail system. This provides better service to airmen while reducing costsfortheFAA.Anyone can search the SPANS system and register for events. To read more about SPANS,visit www.faasafety.gov/spans.  

# Aircraft Classifications and Ultralight Vehicles  

TheFAAusesvariouswaystoclassifyorgroupmachines operated or flownin the air.Themostgeneral groupinguses the term aircraft. This term is in 14 CFR 1.1 and means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air  

Ultra light vehicle is anothergeneral term theFAAuses. This term is defined in 14 CFR 103.As the term implies. powered ultralight vehicles must weighless than 254 pounds emptyweight andunpowered ultra light vehicles must weigh less than 155 pounds.Rules for ultra light vehicles are significantly different from rules for aircraft;ultralight vehicle certification,registration, and operation rules are also contained in 14 CFR 103.  

The FAA differentiates aircraftby their characteristics and physical properties. Key groupings defined in 14 CFR 1.1 include:  

Airplane—an engine-driven fixed-wing aircraft heavier than air, that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings.  Glider—a heavier-than-air aircraft, that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces and whose free flight does not depend principally on an engine. Lighter-than-air aircraft—an aircraft that can rise anc remain suspended by using contained gas weighing less than the air that is displaced by the gas. Airship—an engine-driven lighter-than-air aircraft that can be steered. Balloon—a lighter-than-air aircraft that is not engine driven, and that sustains flight through the use of either gas buoyancy or an airborne heater. Powered-lift—a heavier-than-air aircraft capable of vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and low speed flight that depends principally on engine-driven lift devices or engine thrust for lift during these flight regimes and on nonrotating airfoil(s) for lift during horizontal flight Powered parachute——a powered aircraft comprised of  a flexible or semi-rigid wing connected to a fuselage so that the wing is not in position for flight until the aircraft is in motion. The fuselage of a powered parachute contains the aircraft engine, a seat for each occupant and Is attached to the aircraft's landing gear. Rocketan aircraft propelled by ejected expanding gases generated in the engine from self-contained propellants and not dependent on the intake of outside substances. It includes any part which becomes separated during the operation. Rotorcraft——a heavier-than-air aircraft that depends principally for its support in flight on the lift generated by one or more rotors. Gyroplanea rotorcraft whose rotors are not engine-driven, except for Initial starting, but are made to rotate by action of the air when the rotorcraft Is moving; and whose means of propulsion, consisting usually of conventional  propellers, is Independent of the rotor system. Helicopter—a rotorcraft that, for its horizontal motion, depends principally on its engine-driven rotors. Weight-shift-control——a powered aircraft with a framed pivoting wing and a fuselage controllable only in pitch and roll by the pilot's ability to change the aircraft's  

center of gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control of the aircraft depends on thewing's ability toflexibly deformratherthantheuseofcontrolsurfaces.  

Size and weight are other methods used in14 CFR 1.1 to groupaircraft:  

Large aircraft—an aircraft of more than 12,500 pounds,maximum certificated takeoff weight Light-sport aircraft (LSA)—an aircraft, other than a helicopter or powered-liftthat,since its original certification, has continued to meet the definition in 14 CFR 1.1. (LSA can include airplanes, airships, balloons, gliders, gyro planes, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control.) Small Aircraft—aircraft of 12,500 pounds or less. maximum certificated takeoffweight  

We also use broad classifications of aircraft with respect tc the certification of airmen or withrespect to the certification of the aircraft themselves.See the next section,Pilot Certifications, and Chapter 3, for further discussion of certification.These definitions are in 14 CFR1.1:  

Category 1.  As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges,and limitations of airmen,means a broad classification of aircraft.Examplesinclude: airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air; and 2.As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a grouping of aircraft based upon intended use or operating limitations. Examples include:transport,normal,utility,acrobatic limited, restricted, and provisional. Class 1.  As used with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a classification of aircraft within a category having similar operating characteristics. Examples Include: single engine; multiengine; land; water; gyroplane, helicopter, airship, and free balloon; and 2. As used with respect to the certification of aircraft, means a broad grouping of aircraft having similar characteristics of propulsion, flight, or landing. Examples include: airplane, rotorcraft, gilder, balloon, landplane, and seaplane. Type 1.As used withrespect tothe certification,ratings privileges, and limitations of airmen, means  

a specific make and basic model of aircraft, Including modifications there to that do not change its handling or flight characteristics. Examples include: 737-700,G-IV,and 1900; and As usedwith respect to the certification of aircraft, means those aircraft which are similar in design.Examples include: 737-700 and 737- 700C; G-IV and G-IV-X;and 1900 and 1900C  

This system of definitions allows the FAA to group and regulate aircraft to provide for their safe operation.  

# Pilot Certifications  

The type of intended flying influenceswhat type of pilot's certificate is required. Eligibility, training, experience, and testing requirements differ depending on the type of certificates sought.[Figure1-20]Eachtype of pilot's certificatehas privileges and limitations that are inherent within the certificate itself. However, other privileges and limitations may be applicable based on the aircraft type, operation being conducted,and the type of certificate. For example, a certain certificate may have privileges and limitationsunder14 CFRpart61andpart 91.  

![](images/108464a93c93b9c81167754114226d9a6633862086de20095c1e6a59e0177f32.jpg)

Figure1-2o.Frontside(top)andbackside(bottom)ofanairman certificate issued by the FAA.  

Privileges-define where and when the pilot may fly with whom they may fly,thepurpose of the flight,and the type of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Limitations—the FAA may impose limitations on a pilot certificate if, during training or the practical test, the pilot does not demonstrate all skills necessary to exercise allprivilegesof aprivilegelevel,category, class,or typerating.  

Endorsements,aformof authorization,are written to establish that the certificate holder hasreceived training in specific skill areas.Endorsements are written and signed by an authorized individual, usually a certificated flight instructor (CFI), and are based on aircraft classification.[Figure1-21]  

# Sport Pilot  

To become a sport pilot, the student pilot is required to have flown, at a minimum, the following hours depending upon theaircraft:  

Airplane: 20 hours Powered Parachute:12hours Weight-Shift Control (Trikes): 20 hours Glider:10hours Rotorcraft (gyroplane only): 20 hours Lighter-Than-Air:20hours(airship)or 7hours (balloon)  

To earn a Sport Pilot Certificate, one must:  

Be at least 16 years old to become a student sport pilot (14 years old for gliders or balloons) Be at least 17 years old to test for a sport pilot certificate (16 years old for gliders or balloons) Be able to read, write, and understand the English language Hold a current and valid driver's license as evidence of medical eligibility  

When operating as a sport pilot, some of the following privilegesandlimitationsmayapply  

# Privileges:  

Operate as pilot in command (PIC) of a light-sport aircraft Carry a passenger and share expenses (fuel, oil, airport expenses,and aircraft rental) Fly during the daytime using VFR, a minimum of 3 statute miles visibility and visual contact with the ground arerequired  

Recreational pilot to conduct soloflights for thepurposeof obtaining an additional certificate or ratingwhile under the supervision of an authorized flight instructor: section 61.101(i).  

Icertifythat(Firstname,Ml,Last name)hasreceived therequired training of section 61.87ina(makeandmodel aircraft).T have determined he/she is prepared to conduct a solo flight on(date)under the following conditions:(List all conditions which require endorsement,e.g.,flight which requires communication with air traffic control,flightinan aircraft for which the pilot does not hold a category/classrating,etc.).  

# Limitations:  

Prohibited from flying in Class A airspace Prohibited from flying in Class B, C, or D airspace until you receive training and a logbook endorsement from an instructor Noflights outside the United States without prior permission from the foreign aviation authority Maynottowanyobject No flights while carrying a passenger or property fon compensation orhire Prohibited from flying in furtherance of a business  

The sport pilot certificate does not list aircraft category and classratings.After successfully passing thepractical test for a sport pilot certificate,regardless of the light-sport aircraft privileges you seek,the FAA will issue you a sport pilot certificate without any category and class ratings. The Instructor willprovideyou with the appropriate logbook endorsement for the category and class of aircraft in which you are authorized to act as pilot in command.  

# Recreational Pilot  

To become a recreational pilot, one must:  

Be atleast 17 years old Be able to read, write, speak, and understand the Englishlanguage Pass the required knowledge test Meet the aeronautical experience requirements in either a single-engine airplane, a helicopter, or a gyroplane. Obtain a logbook endorsement from an instructor Pass the required practical test Obtain a third-class medical certificate issued under 14CFRpart67  

As a recreational pilot, cross-country flight is limited to a 50 NM range from the departure airport but is permitted with additional training per 14 CFR part 61, section 61.101(c). Additionally,recreational pilots are restrictedfrom flying at night and flying in airspace where communications with ATCarerequired.  

The minimum aeronautical experience requirements for a recreational pilot license involve:  

30 hours of flight time including at least: 15 hours of dual instruction 2 hours of en route training ? 3hours in preparation for thepractical test 3 hours of solo flight  

When operating as a recreational pilot, some of the following privileges and limitations may apply  

# Privileges:  

Carry no more than one passenger; Not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating expenses of a flight with a passenger, provided the expensesinvolve onlyfuel,oil,airportexpenses,or aircraftrentalfees  

# Limitations:  

A recreational pilotmay not act asPIC of an aircraft that is certificated for more than four occupants or has more than onepowerplant  

# Private Pilot  

A private pilot is one who flies for pleasure or personal business without accepting compensation for flying except in some very limited, specific circumstances. The Private Pilot Certificate is the certificate held by the majority of active pilots. It allows command of any aircraft (subject toappropriate ratings)for any noncommercial purpose andgivesalmostunlimitedauthoritytoflyunderVFR. Passengers maybe carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in anywayfor servicesas a pilot,although passengers can pay a pro rata share of flight expenses, such as fuel or rental costs. If training under 14 CFR part 61, experience requirements include atleast 40hours of piloting time, including 20 hours of flight with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight.[Figure1-22]  

# Commercial Pilot  

A commercial pilot may be compensated for flying. Training for the certificate focuses on a better understanding of aircraft systems and a higher standard of airman ship.The Commercial Pilot Certificate itself does not allow a pilot to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and commercial pilotswithout an instrument rating are restricted today time flight within  $50\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  when flying for hire.  

Acommercial airplane pilot must be ableto operate a complex airplane,as a specific number of hours of complex (or turbine-powered) aircraft time are among the prerequisites,and atleast a portion of the practical examination is performed in a complex aircraft. A complex aircraft must have retractable landing gear, movable flaps, and a controllable-pitch propeller. See 14 CFR part 61, section61.31(e)for additional information.[Figure1-23]  

# Airline Transport Pilot  

The airline transport pilot (ATP) is tested to the highest level of piloting ability.The ATP certificate is a prerequisite for serving as a PIC and second in command(SIC)ofscheduled airline operations. It is also a prerequisite for serving as a PIC in select charter and fractional operations. The minimum pilot experience is 1,500hours of flight time.In addition,the pilot must be atleast 23 years of age,beabletoread,write,speak

and understand the English language, and be “of good moral standing."A pilot may obtain an ATP certificate with restricted privileges enabling him/her to serve as an SIC in scheduled airline operations. The minimum pilot experience is reduced based upon specific academic and flight training experience. The minimum age to be eligible is 21 years.[Figure1-24]  

# Selecting a Flight School  

Selecting a flight school is an important consideration in the flight training process. FAA-approved training centers, FAA-approved pilotschools,noncertificated flyingschools, and independent flight instructors conduct flight training in the United States.All flight training is conducted under the auspicesof theFAAfollowing theregulations outlined in 14 CFR parts 142,141,or 61.Training centers,alsoreferred to as flight academies,operate under 14 CFR part 142 and are certificatedby the FAA.Application for certification is voluntary and the training center must meet stringent requirements for personnel,equipment,maintenance, facilities,and must teach a curriculum approved by the FAA. Training centers typically utilize a number of flight simulation training devices as part of its curricula.Flight training conducted at a training center isprimarilydone under contract to airlines and other commercial operators in transport or turbine aircraft,however many also provide

Flight schools operating under 14CFR part 141 are certificated by the FAA.Applicationfor certification is voluntary and the school must meet stringent requirements for personnel, equipment, maintenance, facilities, and must teach anestablished curriculum,whichincludes a training course outline (TCO) approved by theFAA.Thecertificated schools may qualify for a ground school rating and aflight school rating.In addition, the school may be authorized to give its graduates practical (flight) tests and knowledge (computer administered written)tests.The FAA Pilot School Search database located at http://av-info.faa.gov/PilotSchool. asp,lists certificated ground and flight schools and the pilot training courses each school offers.  

Enrollment in a 14 CFR part 141 flight school ensures quality, continuity, and offers a structured approach to flight training because these facilities must document the training curriculum and have their flight courses approved by the FAA. These strictures allow 14 CFR part 141 schools to complete certificates and ratings infewer flight hours,which can mean a savings on the cost of flight training for the student pilot. For example,the minimum requirement for a Private Pilot Certificate is 35 hours in apart141-certificated school and 40 hours in apart 61-certificated school.(This difference may be insignificant for aPrivate Pilot Certificate because thenational average indicates most pilots require 60 to75hours of flight training.)  

Many excellent flight schools find it impractical to qualify for the FAA part 141 certificates and are referred to as part 61 schools. 14 CFR part 61 outlines certificate and rating requirements for pilot certification through noncertificated schools and individual flight instructors. It also states what knowledge-based training must be covered and how much flight experience is required for each certificate and rating. Flight schools and flight instructors who train must adhere to the statutory requirements and train pilots to the standards found in14 CFRpart 61.  

One advantage of flight training under 14 CFR part 61 is its flexibility. Flight lessons can be tailored to the individual student,because 14 CFR part 61 dictates the required minimum flight experience and knowledge-based training necessary to gain a specific pilot'slicense,butitdoesnot stipulate how the training is to be organized. This flexibility can also be a disadvantage because a flight instructor who fails to organize the flight training can cost a student pilot time and expense through repetitious training. One way for a student pilot to avoid this problem is to ensure the flight instructor has a well-documented training syllabus.  

# How To Find a Reputable Flight Program  

To obtain information about pilot training, contact the local FSDO, which maintains a current file on all schools within its district. The choice of a flight school depends on what type of certificate is sought,andwhether an individual wishes to fly as a sport pilot or wishes to pursue a career as a professional pilot. Another consideration is the amount of time that can be devoted to training.Ground and flight training should be obtained as regularly and frequently as possible because this assures maximum retention of instruction and the achievement of requisite proficiency.  

Do not make the determination based onfinancial concerns alone,because the quality of training is very important. Prior to making a final decision,visit the schools under consideration and talk with management, instructors, and students.Request a personal tour of the flight school facility.  

Be inquisitive and proactive when searching for a flight school,dosomehomework,and develop a checklist of questions by talking to pilots and reading articles in flight magazines.The checklist should include questions about aircraft reliability and maintenance practices, and questions for current students such as whether or not there is a safe. clean aircraft available when they are scheduled to fly  

Questionsfor the training facility should be aimed at determining if the instruction fits available personal time. What are the school's operating hours? Does thefacility have dedicated classrooms available for ground training required by the FAA?Is there an area available for preflight briefings, postflight debriefings, and critiques?Are these rooms private in nature in order to provide a nonthreatening environment in which theinstructor can explain the content and outcome of the flight without making the student feel self-conscious?  

Examine thefacility before committing to anyflight training Evaluate the answers on the checklist,and then take time to think things over before making a decision.This proactive approach to choosing a flight school will ensure a student pilot contracts with a flight school or flight instructor best suited to their individual needs.  

# How To Choose a Certificated Flight Instructor (CFl  

Whetheranindividualchoosestotrainunder14CFRpart 141orpart61,the key to an effective flight program is the quality of the ground and flight training received from the CFI. The flight instructor assumes total responsibility for training an individual to meet the standards required for certification within an ever-changing operating environment. ACF I should possess an understanding of the learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of teaching, and the ability to communicate effectively with the student pilot. During the certification process,a flight instructor applicant is tested on the practical application of these skills in specific teaching situations.The flight instructor is crucial to the scenario-based training program endorsed by the FAA. He or she is trained to function in the learning environment as an advisor and guide for the learner.Theduties,responsibilities and authority of the CFI include thefollowing:  

Orient the student to the scenario-based training system Helpthe student become a confident planner and inflight manager of each flight and a critical evaluator of their own performance Help the student understand the knowledge requirements present in real world applications Diagnose learning difficulties and help the student overcomethem Evaluate student progress and maintain appropriate records Provide continuous review of student learning  

Should a student pilot find the selected CFIis not training in a manner conducive for learning, or the student and CFI do not have compatible schedules,the student pilot should find another CFI. Choosing the right CFI is important because the quality of instruction and the knowledge and skills acquired from their flight instructor affect a student pilot's entire flyingcareer.  

# TheStudentPilot  

The first step in becoming a pilot is to select a type of aircraft. FAA rules for obtaining a pilot's certificate differ depending on the type of aircraft flown. Individuals can choose among airplanes, gyroplanes, weight-shift, helicopters, powered parachutes, gliders, balloons,or airships. A pilot does not need a certificate to fly ultra light vehicles.  

# Basic Requirements  

A student pilot is one who is being trained by an instructor pilot for his or her first full certificate, and is permitted to fly alone (solo) under specific, limited circumstances. Before a student pilot may be endorsed to fly solo,that student must have a Student Pilot Certificate.Thereare multiple ways that an aspiring pilot can obtain their Student Pilot Certificate. The application may be processed by an FAA inspector or technician,anFAA-DesignatedPilot Examiner, a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), or an Airman Certification Representative (ACR). If the application is completed electronically, the authorized person will submit the application to theFAA's Airman Certification Branch (AFS-760)in Oklahoma City,OK,via the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA). If the application is completed on paper,itmustbesent to thelocal Flight Standards District Office(FSDO),whowill forward it to AFS-760. Once the application is processed, the applicantwill receive the Student Pilot Certificate by mail at the address provided onthe application.  

The aforementioned process will become effective on April 1, 2016. The new certificate will be printed on a plastic card, whichwill replace thepaper certificate that was issued in the past.The plastic card certificate will not have an expiration date.Paper certificates issuedprior to the new process will still expire according to the date on thecertificate; however, under the new process, paper certificates cannot be renewed. Once the paper certificate expires,the Student Pilot must submit a new application under the new process. Another significant changein thenew process is that flight instructors will now make endorsements for solo privileges in the Student Pilot's logbook, instead of endorsing the Student Pilot Certificate.  

To be eligible for a Student Pilot Certificate, the applicant must:  

Be at least 16years of age(14years of age to pilot a glider orballoon). Be able to read, speak, write, and understand the Englishlanguage.  

# Medical Certification Requirements  

The second step in becoming a pilot is to obtain a medical certificate (if the choice of aircraft is an airplane, helicopter. gyroplane, or an airship). (The FAA suggests the individual get a medical certificate before beginning flight training to avoid the expense of flight training that cannot be continued due to a medical condition.)Balloon or glider pilots do not need a medical certificate,but do need to write a statement certifying that no medical defect exists that would prevent them from piloting a balloon or glider. The new sport pilot category does not require a medical examination;adriver's license can be used as proof of medical competence. Applicants who fail tomeet certain requirements or who have physical disabilities which might limit,but not prevent,theiracting aspilots,should contact the nearest FAA office.Anyone requesting an FAA Medical Clearance, Medical Certificate,or Student Pilot Medical Certificate can electronically complete an application through the FAA's MedXPress system available at https://medxpress.faa.gov/.  

A medical certificate is obtainedby passing a physical examination administered by a doctor who isanFAA- authorized AME. There are approximately 6,000 FAA-authorized AMEs in the nation.TofindanAMEnear you, go to the FAA's AME locator at www.faa.gov/pilots/ amelocator/.Medical certificates are designated as first class, second class, or third class. Generally, first class is designed for the airline transport pilot; second class for the commercial pilot; and third class forthe student, recreational, and private pilot.AStudent Pilot Certificate canbeprocessed by an FAA inspector or technician, an FAA Designated pilot examiner (DPE), an Airman Certification Representative (ACR), or a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI). This certificate allows an individual who is being trained by a flight instructor to fly alone (solo) under specific, limited circumstances and must be carried with the student pilot while exercising soloflight privileges.The Student Pilot Certificateis only required when exercising solo flight privileges.The new plastic student certificate does not have an expiration date.For airmen who were issued a paper certificate,thatcertificate will remain valid until its expiration date.A paper certificate cannot be renewed.When the paper certificate expires, a new application must be completed via the IACRA system, and a new plastic certificate will be issued.  

# Student Pilot Solo Requirements  

Onceastudenthas accrued sufficient training and experience a CF I can endorse the student's logbook to authorize limited solo flight in a specific type (make and model) of aircraft. A student pilot may not carry passengers, fly in furtherance of a business, or operate an aircraft outside of the various endorsements provided by the flight instructor. There is no minimum aeronautical knowledge or experience requirement for the issuance of a Student Pilot Certificate,however,the applicant mustbe atleast16years of age (14years of age for a pilotfor glider orballoon), and they must be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language. There are, however,minimum aeronautical knowledge and experience requirements for student pilots to solo  

# BecomingaPilot  

The course ofinstruction a student pilot follows depends on the type of certificate sought. It should include the ground and flight training necessary to acquire the knowledge and skills required to safely and efficiently function as a certificated pilot in the selected category and class of aircraft.The specific knowledge and skill areas for each category and classof aircraft are outlined in 14 CFR part 61.Eligibility. aeronautical knowledge, proficiency, and aeronautical requirements can be found in 14 CFR part 61.  

Recreational Pilot, see subpart L PrivatePilot,seesubpart E Sport Pilot, see subpart J  

of training and testing materials which are available in print form from the Superintendent of Documents,GPO, and online at the Regulatory Support Division:www.faa.gov/ about/office_org/headquarters offices/avs/offices/afs/afs600.  

The CF I may also use commercial publications as a source of study materials, especially for aircraft categories where government materials are limited.A student pilot should follow the flight instructor's advice on what and when to study. Planning a definite study program and following it as closely as possiblewill help in scoring well on theknowledge test. Haphazard or disorganized study habits usually result in an unsatisfactory score.  

In addition to learning aeronautical knowledge,suchas the principles of flight, a student pilot is also required to gain skill in flight maneuvers. The selected category and class of aircraft determines the type of flight skills and number of flight hours tobe obtained. There are four steps involved in learning a flight maneuver:  

The CFI introduces and demonstrates flight maneuver tothestudent. The CFI talks the student pilot through the maneuver. The student pilot practices the maneuver under CFI supervision. The CFI authorizes the student pilot topractice the maneuversolo.  

Once the student pilot has shown proficiency in the required knowledgeareas,flightmaneuvers,and accrued the required amount of flight hours, the CFI endorses the student pilot logbook,which allows the student pilot to take the written and practical testsfor pilot certification.  

# Knowledge and Skill Tests  

# KnowledgeTests  

The knowledge testis the computer portion of the tests taken to obtain pilot certification.The test contains questions of the objective,multiple-choice type.This testing method conservestheapplicant'stime,eliminatesanyelementof individual judgment in determining grades, and saves time inscoring  

FAAAirmanKnowledgeTestGuidesforeverytypeofpilot certificate address most questions you may have regarding theknowledge test process.The guides are available on- line (free of charge) at http://www.faa.gov/training testing/ testing/test_guides/.  

The knowledge-based portion of training is obtained through FAAhandbookssuchasthisone,textbooks,andothersources  

# WhenToTaketheKnowledgeTest  

The knowledge test is more meaningful to the applicant and more likely to result in a satisfactory grade if it is taken afterbeginning the flight portion of thetraining.Therefore, the FAA recommends the knowledge test betaken after the student pilot has completed a solo cross-country flight. The operational knowledge gained by this experience can be used to the student's advantage in theknowledge test. The student pilot's CFIis thebest personto determine when the applicant is ready to take the knowledge test.  

# Practical Test  

The FAA has developed PTS for FAA pilot certificates and associated ratings.[Figure 1-25] In 2015,the FAA began transitioning to theACSapproach.TheACSis essentially an “enhanced"version of the PTS.It adds task- specific knowledge and risk management elements to each PTS Area of Operation and Task. The result is a holistic, integrated presentation of specific knowledge, skills, and risk management elements and performance metrics for each Area of Operation and Task The ACS evaluation program will eventually replace thePTS programfor evaluating and certifying pilots.  

The practical tests are administered by FAA ASIs and DPEs Title 14 CFR part 61 specifies the areas of operation in which knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the applicant Since the FAA requires all practical tests be conducted in accordance with the appropriate PTS and the policies set forth in the Introduction section of thePTS book.The pilot applicant should become familiar with this book during training  

ThePTSbookis a testingdocument andnotintended tobe a training syllabus. An appropriately-rated flight instructor is responsible for training the pilot applicant toacceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers.Descriptions of tasks and information on how to perform maneuvers and procedures are contained in reference andteachingdocumentssuchasthishandbook.Alistof reference documents is contained in the Introduction section of eachPTSbook.Copiesmay obtainedby:  

DownloadingfromtheFAAwebsiteatwww.faa.gov Purchasing print copies from the GPO, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,orvia their official online bookstore atwww.access.gpo.gov  

The flight proficiency maneuvers listed in 14 CFR part 61 are the standard skill requirementsfor certification.They are outlined in the PTS as "areas of operation." These are phases of the practical test arranged in a logical sequence within the standard. They begin with preflight preparation and end with post flight procedures.Each area of operation

contains “tasks,”which are comprised of knowledge areas, flight procedures, and/orflight maneuvers appropriate to the areaofoperation.The candidate is required to demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in all tasks for the original issuanceofallpilotcertificates.  

# When To Take the Practical Test  

14 CFR part 61 establishes the ground school and flight experience requirements for the type of certification and aircraft selected.However,the CF I best determines when an applicant is qualified for the practical test.A practice practical test is an important step in the flight training process.  

The applicant will be asked to present the following documentation:  

FAA Form8710-1 (8710.11forsport pilot applicants), Application for an Airman Certificate and/or Rating, with the flight instructor'srecommendation AnAirman Knowledge Test Report with a satisfactory grade A medical certificate (not required for glider or balloon), a Student Pilot Certificate, and a pilot logbook endorsed by a flight instructor for solo, solo cross-country (airplane and rotorcraft), and for the make and model aircraft to be used for the practical test (driver's license or medical certificate for sport pilot applicants) Thepilotlogbookrecords A graduation certificatefrom an FAA-approved school (if applicable)  

The applicant must provide an airworthy aircraft with equipment relevant to the areas of operation required for thepractical test.He or shewill alsobe asked to produce andexplainthe:  

Aircraft's registration certificate Aircraft's air worthiness certificate Aircraft's operating limitations or FAA-approved aircraft flight manual (if required) Aircraft equipment list Required weight and balance data Maintenance records Applicable air worthiness directives(ADs)  

For a detailed explanation of the required pilot maneuvers and performance standards,refer to thePTS pertaining to the type of certification and aircraft selected.These standards maybe downloadedfreeofchargefromtheFAA atwww.faa.gov.They may also be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents or GPObookstores.Most airport fixed-base operators and flight schools carry a variety of government publications and charts, aswell as commercially published materials.  

# Who Administers the FAA Practical Tests?  

Due to the varied responsibilities of the F SDOs,practicaltests areusually given by DPEs.An applicant should schedule the practical test by appointment to avoid conflicts and wasted time.A list of examiner names can be obtained from thelocal FSDO.Since a DPE serves without payfrom the government for conducting practical tests and processing the necessary reports, the examiner is allowed to charge a reasonable fee. There is no charge for the practical test when conducted by anFAAinspector.  

# Role of the Certificated Flight Instructor  

To become a CFI, a pilot must meet the provisions of 14 CFR part61.The FAA places full responsibility for student flight training on the shoulders of the CFI, who is the cornerstone of aviation safety. It is the job of the flight instructor to train the student pilot in all the knowledge areas and teach the skills necessary for the student pilot to operate safely and competently as a certificated pilot in the NAS. The training includes airman ship skills,pilot judgment and decision- making,and good operating practices.  

A pilot trainingprogram depends on the quality of the ground and flight instruction the student pilot receives. The flight instructor must possess a thorough understanding of the learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of teaching,and the ability to communicate effectively with the studentpilot.Useof a structured training program andformal course syllabus is crucial for effective and comprehensive flight training. It should be clear to the student in advance of everylessonwhat thecourseof trainingwill involve andthe criteria for successful completion.This should include the flight instructor briefing and debriefing the student before and after every lesson.Additionally,scenario-based traininghas become the preferred method of flight instruction today.This involves presenting the student with realistic flight scenarios and recommended actions for mitigating risk  

Insistence on correct techniques and procedures from the beginning of training by the flight instructor ensures that the student pilotdevelops proper flyinghabits.Any deficiencies in the maneuvers or techniques must immediately be emphasized and corrected.A flight instructor serves as arole modelfor the studentpilotwho observes the flying habits of his or her flight instructor during flight instruction, as well as when the instructor conducts other pilot operations. Thus, the flight instructor becomes a model of flying proficiency for the student who, consciously or unconsciously, attempts toimitatetheinstructor.For this reason,aflight instructor should observe recognized safety practices, as well as regulations during all flight operations.  

The student pilot who enrolls in a pilot training program commits considerable time,effort,and expense to achieve a pilot certificate.Students oftenjudge the effectiveness of the flight instructor and the success of the pilot training program based on their ability to pass the requisite FAA practical test.A competent flight instructor stresses to the student that practical tests are a sampling of pilot ability compressed into a short period of time.The goal of a flight instructor is to train the“total"pilot.  

# Role of the Designated Pilot Examiner  

The Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) plays an important rolein the FAA's mission of promoting aviation safety by administering FAA practical tests for pilot and Flight Instructor Certificates and associated ratings.Although administering these tests is a responsibility of the AsI, the FAA's highest priority is making air travel safer by inspecting aircraft that fly in the United States.To satisfy the need for pilot testing and certification services, the FAA delegates certain responsibilities to private individuals who are not FAAemployees.  

Appointed in accordance with 14 CFR part 183, section 183.23,a DPEis an individual who meets the qualification requirementsof the Pilot Examiner's Handbook,FAA Order 8710.3,andwho:  

Istechnically qualified Holds all pertinent category, class, and type ratings for each aircraft related to their designation Meets requirements of 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.56, 61.57, and 61.58, as appropriate Is current and qualified to act as PIC of each aircraft forwhichhe or sheis authorized Maintains at least a Third-Class Medical Certificate, if required Maintains a current Flight Instructor Certificate, if required  

servethepublic,and must adheretoFAA policiesand procedures in certification matters. The FAA expects the DPE to administer practical tests with the same degree of professionalism, using the same methods, procedures, and standards as an FAA AS I.  

# Chapter Summary  

The FAA has entered the second century of civil aviation as a robust government organization andis takingfull advantage of technology,such as Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite technology to enhance the safety of civil aviation.TheInternet has also become an important tool in promoting aviation safety andproviding around-the-clock resourcesfor the aviation community.Handbooks,regulations,standards,references, andonlinecoursesarenowavailableatwww.faa.gov.  

In keeping with the FAA'sbelief that safety is a learned behavior, the FAA offers many courses and seminars to enhance air safety. The FAA puts theburden of instilling safe flying habits on the flight instructor, who should follow basic flight safety practices and procedures in every flight operation he or she undertakes with a student pilot. Operational safety practices include, but are not limited to, collision avoidance procedures consisting of proper scanning techniques, use of checklists, runway incursion avoidance, positive transfer of controls, and workload management. These safety practices are discussed more fully within this handbook. Safe flight also depends on Scenario-BasedTraining(SBT)thatteaches the student pilot how to respond in different flight situations. The FAA has incorporated these techniques along with decision- making methods, such as aeronautical decision-making

 (ADM), risk management, and crew resource management

 (CRM), which are covered more completely in Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-Making

# Introduction  

Aeronautical decision-making (ADM) is decision-making in a unique environment aviation.It isasystematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances. It is what a pilot intends to dobased on the latestinformationhe orshehas.  

![](images/1cee8b260e62110fa7c2811a43f4d9637a34aa6b5563bcc60875b7dcf5c7568b.jpg)  

The importance of learning and understanding effective ADM skills cannot be overemphasized.While progress is continually being made in the advancement of pilot training methods, aircraft equipment and systems, and services for pilots, accidents still occur. Despite all the changes in technology to improve flight safety, one factor remains the same:the human factor which leads to errors.Itisestimated that approximately 80 percent of all aviation accidents are related to human factors and the vast majority of these accidents occur during landing (24.1 percent) and takeoff (23.4percent).[Figure2-1]  

ADM is a systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management.To understand ADM is to also understand how personal attitudes can influence decision-makingand how those attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the flightdeck.Itis important tounderstand thefactors thatcause humans to make decisions and how the decision-making processnotonlyworks,butcanbeimproved.  

This chapter focuses on helping the pilot improve his or her ADM skills with the goal of mitigating the risk factors associated with flight.Advisory Circular(AC)60-22. "Aeronautical Decision-Making,” provides background references,definitions,and other pertinent information about ADM training in the general aviation(GA) environment. [Figure2-2]  

# HistoryofADM  

For over 25 years, the importance of good pilot judgment, or aeronautical decision-making(ADM),has been recognized as critical to the safe operation of aircraft,aswell asaccident avoidance.The airline industry,motivated by the need to reduce accidents caused by human factors,developed the first training programs based on improving ADM. Crew resource management (CRM) training for flight crews is focused on the effective use of all available resources:human resources, hardware, and information supporting ADM to facilitate crew cooperation and improve decision-making.Thegoal of all flight crews is good ADM and the use of CRM is one way to make good decisions.  

Researchinthis areapromptedtheFederalAviation Administration (FAA) to produce training directed at improving the decision-making of pilots and led to current FAA regulations that require that decision-making be taught as part of the pilot training curriculum. ADM research, development,and testing culminatedin 1987 with the publication of six manuals oriented to the decision-making needs of variously rated pilots. These manuals provided multifaceted materials designed to reduce the number ofdecision-related accidents.The effectiveness of these materials was validated in independent studies wherestudent pilots received such trainingin conjunction with the standard flying curriculum.When tested, the pilots who had received ADM-training made fewerin-flight errors than those whohad  

![](images/d49653000cc327b23f29d52e89d5af9ddee8d5e6d783fc22c6cf3c68c4fe1d6a.jpg)

not received ADM training.The differences were statistically significant and ranged from about 10 to 50 percent fewer judgmenterrors.In the operational environment,anoperator flying about 400,000hours annually demonstrated a 54 percent reduction in accident rate after using thesematerials for re currency training  

Contrary to popular opinion, good judgment can be taught Tradition held that good judgment was a natural by-product of experience, but as pilots continued to log accident-free flight hours, a corresponding increase of good judgment was assumed. Building upon the foundation of conventional decision-making,ADM enhances the process to decrease the probability of human error and increase the probability of a safe flight. ADM provides a structured, systematic approach to analyzing changes that occur during a flight and how these changes might affect the safe outcome of a flight. The ADM process addresses all aspects of decision-making in the flight deck and identifies the steps involved in good decision-making  

Steps for good decision-making are:  

1. Identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight 2. Learning behavior modification techniques 3. Learning how to recognize and cope with stress 4.Developing risk assessment skills  

5. Using all resources 6. Evaluating the effectiveness of one'sADMskills  

# RiskManagement  

Thegoalof riskmanagement is to pro actively identify safety-relatedhazards and mitigate the associated risks.Risk management is an important component of ADM.When a pilot follows good decision-making practices, the inherent risk in a flight is reduced or even eliminated.The ability to make good decisions is based upon director indirect experience andeducation.The formal risk management decision-making processinvolves sixsteps as shown inFigure2-3.  

Consider automotive seat belt use.In just two decades, seat belt use has become the norm, placing those who do not wear seat belts outside the norm, but this group may learn to wear a seat belt by either direct or indirect experience.For example, a driverlearns through direct experience about the value of wearing a seat belt when he or she is involved in a car accident that leads to a personal injury. An indirect learning experience occurswhen aloved one is injured during a car accident because he or she failed to wear a seatbelt.  

Asyouwork throughtheADM cycle,it is important to rememberthefour fundamental principles of risk management  

![](images/b7f7e83981933820b092c6cb1b316497e8f6e84477b503de6de11b970956b60f.jpg)  
Figure2-3.Risk management decision-makingprocess.  

Accept no unnecessary risk.Flying is not possible without risk,but unnecessary risk comes without a corresponding return. If you are flying a new airplane for the first time, you might determine that the risk of making that flight in low visibility conditions is unnecessary.  

2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level.Risk decisionsshouldbemadebythepersonwhocan develop and implement risk controls.Remember thatyou are pilot-in-command,sonever let anyone else——not ATC and not your passengers——make risk decisionsforyou  

3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh dangers (costs). In any flying activity, it is necessary to accept some degree of risk.A day with good weather,forexample is a much better time to fly an unfamiliar airplane fon the first time than a daywith lowIFR conditions.  

Integrate risk management into planning at all levels Because risk is an unavoidable part of every flight safety requires the use of appropriate and effective risk management notjust in thepreflight planningstage, but in all stages of theflight  

While poor decision-making in everyday life does not always lead totragedy,the margin for error in aviationis thin.Since ADMenhances management ofan aeronautical environment, all pilots should become familiar with and employ ADM  

# Crew Resource Management (CRM) and Single-Pilot Resource Management  

While CR M focuses on pilots operating in crew environments. many of the concepts apply to single-pilot operations. Many CRM principles havebeen successfully applied tosingle-pilot aircraft and led to the development of Single-PilotResource Management(SRM).SRM is defined as the art and science of managing all the resources (both on-board the aircraft and from outside sources) available to a single pilot (prior to and during flight)to ensure the successful outcome of the flight.SRMincludes theconcepts of ADM,riskmanagement

 (RM), task management (TM), automation management

 (AM), controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) awareness, and situational awareness(SA).SRM training helps the pilot maintain situational awareness by managing the automation andassociatedaircraftcontrolandnavigationtasks.This enables the pilot to accurately assess and manage risk and make accurate and timely decisions  

SRM is all about helping pilots learn how to gather information,analyzeit,and make decisions.Although the flight is coordinated by a single person and not an onboard flight crew,theuse of available resources such as auto-pilot and air traffic control (ATC) replicates the principles of CRM  

# Hazard and Risk  

Two defining elements of ADMarehazard andrisk.Hazard is are alor perceived condition,event,or circumstance that a pilotencounters.When faced with a hazard,thepilotmakes an assessment of that hazard based upon various factors.The pilot assigns a value to the potential impact of the hazard, which qualifies the pilot's assessment of the hazardrisk.  

Therefore,risk is an assessment of the single or cumulative hazard facing a pilot;however,different pilots see hazards differently. For example, the pilot arrives to preflight and discovers a small, blunt type nick in the leading edge at the middle of the aircraft's prop. Since the aircraft is parked on the tarmac, the nick was probably caused by another aircraft's prop wash blowing some type of debris into the propeller. The nick is the hazard (a present condition). The risk is prop fracture if the engine is operated with damage to a prop blade  

The seasoned pilotmayseethe nick asa lowrisk.He realizes this type of nick diffuses stress over alargearea,is located in the strongest portion of the propeller, and based on experience; he does not expect it to propagate a crack that can lead to high risk problems.He does not cancel his flight The inexperienced pilot may see the nick as ahighriskfactor because he is unsure of the affect the nick will have on the operation of the prop, andhehasbeen told that damage to a prop could cause a catastrophic failure.This assessment leads him to cancel his flight.  

Therefore,elements or factors affecting individuals are different and profoundly impact decision-making.These are called human factors and can transcend education, experience,health,physiological aspects,etc.  

Anotherexampleofriskassessmentwastheflightofa Beechcraft King Air equipped with deicing and anti-icing. The pilot deliberately flew into moderate to severe icing conditions while ducking under cloud cover.Aprudentpilot would assess the risk as high and beyond the capabilities of the aircraft, yet this pilot did the opposite.Why did the pilot takethisaction?  

Past experience promptedthe action.The pilot had successfully flownintothese conditions repeatedly although the icing conditions were previously forecast 2,0o0feet above thesurface.Thistime,the conditions were forecast from the surface. Since the pilot was in a hurry and failed to factor in the difference between theforecast altitudes,he assigned a low risk to the hazard and took a chance.Heandthe passengers died from a poor risk assessment of the situation.  

# Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes  

Being fit tofly depends on more than just a pilot's physical condition and recent experience. For example, attitude affects the quality of decisions.Attitude is a motivational predisposition torespond topeople,situations,oreventsin a givenmanner.Studies have identified five hazardous attitudes that can interfere with the ability to make sound decisions and exercise authority properly: anti-authority,impulsivity, invulnerability, macho, and resignation. [Figure 2-4]  

Hazardous attitudes contribute to poor pilot judgment but can be effectively counteracted by redirecting the hazardous attitude so that correct action can betaken.Recognitionof hazardous thoughts is the first step toward neutralizing them. After recognizing a thought as hazardous, the pilot should label it as hazardous, then state the corresponding antidote. Antidotesshouldbememorizedforeachofthehazardous attitudessothey automatically come to mind when needed.  

![Figure2-4.The five hazardous attitudes identified throughpast and contemporary study ](images/599f5e4bfbac8c29037e5e3d296a4e1d421cf842aa87401159735d49c53be12a.jpg)  

During eachflight, the singlepilot makes manydecisions under hazardous conditions. To fly safely, the pilot needs to assess the degree of risk and determine the best course of action to mitigate the risk  

# AssessingRisk  

For the single pilot, assessing risk is not as simple as it sounds. For example, the pilot acts as his or her own quality control in making decisions. If a fatigued pilot who has flown 16 hours is asked if he or she is too tired to continue flying, the answer may be"no." Most pilots are goal oriented and when asked to accept a flight, there is a tendency to deny personal limitations while addingweight toissues not germane to the mission.For example,pilots of helicopter emergency services (EMS)havebeenknown(more than othergroups)tomake flight decisions that add significant weight to the patient's welfare. These pilots add weight to intangible factors (the patient in this case) and fail to appropriately quantify actual hazards, such as fatigue or weather, when making flight decisions. The single pilot who has no other crew member for consultation must wrestle with the intangible factors that drawoneintoahazardousposition.Therefore,heorshehas a greater vulnerability than a full crew.  

Examining National Transportation Safety Board(NTSB) reports and other accident research can help a pilotlearn to assess risk more effectively. For example, the accident rate during night visual flight rules (VFR) decreases by nearly 50 percent once a pilot obtains 1o0 hours and continues to decrease until the 1,ooo hour level. The data suggest that for the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night might want to establish higherpersonal limitations than arerequired by the regulations and, if applicable, apply instrument flying skills in this environment.  

Several risk assessment models are available to assist in the processofassessingrisk.Themodels,alltakingslightly different approaches,seek a common goal of assessing risk in an objective manner.The most basic tool is the risk matrix. [Figure2-5]It assesses two items:the likelihood of an event occurring and the consequence of thatevent.  

# LikelihoodofanEvent  

Likelihood is nothing more than taking a situation and determining the probability of its occurrence. It is rated as probable, occasional, remote, orimprobable. Forexample, a pilotis flying from point A to point B(50 miles)inmarginal visual flight rules(MVFR）conditions.Thelikelihoodof encountering potential instrument meteorological conditions (IMC)is the first question the pilot needs to answer.The experiencesofotherpilots,coupledwiththeforecast,might

Figure2-5.Thisriskmatrixcanbeusedforalmostanyoperation by assigning likelihood and consequence.In the case presented, the pilot assigned a likelihood of occasional and the severity as catastrophic.Asonecansee,this falls in the high risk area.  

cause the pilot to assign“occasional"todetermine the probability of encountering I MC  

The following are guidelines for making assignments  

Probable an event will occur several times Occasional—anevent willprobably occur sometime Remote—an event is unlikely to occur, but is possible Improbablean event is highly unlikely to occur  

# Severity of anEvent  

Thenextelement is theseverity or consequenceof a pilot's action(s).It can relate to injury and/ordamage.If the individual in the example above is not an instrument rated pilot,what are the consequences of him or her encountering inadvertent I MC conditions?Inthiscase,becausethepilot is not IFR rated, the consequences are catastrophic. The following are guidelines for this assignment.  

Catastrophic results in fatalities,totalloss Critical—severe injury, major damage Marginal—minor injury, minor damage Negligible——less than minor injury, less than minor systemdamage  

Simply connecting the two factors as shown in Figure 2-5 indicates the risk is high and the pilot must either not fly or fly only after finding ways to mitigate, eliminate, or control therisk.  

Although the matrix in Figure 2-5 provides a general viewpoint of a generic situation, a more comprehensive program can be made that is tailored to a pilot'sflying.[Figure2-6]This program includes a wide array of aviation-related activities specific tothepilot and assesses health,fatigue,weather,

capabilities, etc. The scores are added and the overall score falls into various ranges, with the range representative of actions that a pilotimposes uponhimself orherself  

# Mitigating Risk  

Risk assessment is only part of the equation.After determining the level of risk,the pilot needs to mitigate the risk. For example, the pilot flying from point A to point B (50 miles)in M VFR conditions has several ways to reduce risk:  

Wait for the weather to improve to good visual flight rules(VFR)conditions. Take an instrument-rated pilot. Delaytheflight. Cancel theflight. Drive.  

One of the best ways single pilots can mitigate risk is to use theIMSAFE checklist to determine physical and mental readiness for flying:  

1. Illness—Am I sick?Illness is an obvious pilot risk 2. Medication—Am I taking any medicines that might affect my judgment or make me drowsy? 3. Stress—Am I under psychological pressure from the job?DoIhave money,health,or family problems? Stress causes concentration and performance problems. Whilethe regulations list medical conditions that require grounding, stress is not among them. The pilot should consider the effects of stress on performance. 4. Alcohol—Have I been drinking within 8 hours? Within 24 hours? As little as one ounce of liquor, one bottle of beer, or four ounces of wine can impair flying skills. Alcohol also renders a pilot more susceptible to disorientation and hypoxia. 5. Fatigue—Am I tired and not adequately rested? Fatigue continues to be one of themost insidious hazards to flight safety, as it may not be apparent to a pilot until serious errors are made. 6. Emotion—Am I emotionally upset?  

# ThePAVEChecklist  

Another way to mitigate risk is to perceive hazards.By incorporating the PAVE checklist into preflight planning. the pilot divides the risks of flight into four categories:Pilot- in-command (PIC),Aircraft,enVironment,and External pressures (PAVE)which form part of a pilot's decision- makingprocess.  

With the PAVE checklist,pilots have a simple way to remember each category to examine for risk prior to each flight Once a pilot identifies the risks of aflight,heorsheneeds to decide whether the risk,or combination of risks,canbe managed safely and successfully. If not, make the decision to cancel theflight. If the pilot decides to continue with the flight he or she should develop strategies to mitigate the risks. One way a pilot can control the risks is to set personal minimums for items in each risk category.These are limits unique to that individual pilot's current level of experience and proficiency.  

For example, the aircraft may have a maximum crosswind component of 15 knots listed in the aircraft flight manual (AFM), and the pilot has experience with 10 knots of direct crosswind.Itcouldbeunsafetoexceed a10knotcrosswind component without additional training. Therefore, the 10knot crosswind experience level is that pilot's personal limitation until additional training with a certificated flight instructor (CFI) provides the pilot with additional experience for flying in cross winds that exceed 1 o knots.  

One of the most important conceptsthat safe pilots understand is the difference between what is “legal"in terms of the regulations, and what is "smart”" or "safe" in terms of pilot experience and proficiency.  

#  $P=$  Pilot in Command (PIC)  

The pilot is one of the risk factors in a flight. The pilot must ask,“Am I ready for this trip?"in terms of experience recency, currency, physical, and emotional condition. The IMSAFE checklist provides the answers.  

#  $A=$  Aircraft  

What limitations will the aircraft impose upon the trip? Ask the following questions:  

Is this the right aircraft for the flight? AmIfamiliarwith and current in this aircraft?Aircraft performance figures and the AFM arebased on a brand new aircraft flown by a professional test pilot. Keep that in mind while assessing personal and aircraft performance. Is this aircraft equipped for the flight? Instruments? Lights? Navigation and communication equipment adequate? Can this aircraft use the runways available for the trip with an adequate margin of safety under the conditions to be flown? Canthis aircraft carry the plannedload? Canthisaircraftoperateatthe altitudesneededforthe trip? Does this aircraft have sufficient fuel capacity, with reserves, for trip legs planned?  

Doesthefuelquantitydeliveredmatchthefuel quantity ordered?  

# V=EnVironment  

# Weather  

Weatheris a major environmental consideration. Earlier it was suggested pilots set their own personal minimums,especially when it comes to weather.As pilots evaluate the weather for a particular flight, they should consider the following:  

What isthe current ceiling and visibility?In mountainous terrain,consider havinghigher minimums for ceiling and visibility, particularly if the terrain is unfamiliar. Consider the possibility that the weather may be different than forecast. Have alternative plans and be ready and willing to divert, should an unexpected changeoccur. Consider the winds at the airports being used and the strength of the crosswind component. If flying in mountainous terrain, consider whether there are strong winds aloft.Strongwindsin mountainous terrain can cause severe turbulence and downdrafts and be very hazardous for aircrafteven when there is no other significant weather. Are there any thunderstorms present orforecast? If there are clouds, is there any icing, current or forecast? What is the temperature/dew point spread and the current temperature at altitude? Can descent be made safely all along theroute? If icing conditions are encountered, is the pilot experienced at operating the aircraft'sdeicingor anti-icing equipment?Is thisequipment ingood condition and functional? For what icing conditions is the aircraft rated, if any?  

# Terrain  

Evaluation of terrain is another important component of analyzing the flight environment.  

To avoid terrain and obstacles, especially at night or in low visibility, determine safe altitudes in advance by using the altitudes shown on VFR and IFR charts during pre flight planning. Use maximum elevation figures (MEFs) and other easilyobtainabledatatominimizechancesofan inflight collisionwith terrain or obstacles.  

# Airport  

What lights are available at the destination and alternate airports?VASI/PAPI or IL S glide slope  

guidance?Is the terminal airport equipped with them? Are they working?Will the pilot need to use the radio to activate the airport lights? Check the Notices to Airmen(NOTAM)forclosed runways or airports. Look for runway or beacon lights out,nearbytowers,etc. Choose the flight route wisely.An engine failure gives the nearby airports supreme importance. Are there shorter or obstructed fields at the destination and/or alternate airports?  

# Airspace  

If the trip is over remote areas,is there appropriate clothing, water, and survival gear onboard in the event of a forced landing? If the trip includes flying over water or unpopulated areas with the chance of losingvisual reference to the horizon, the pilot must be prepared to fly IFR. Check the airspace and any temporaryflight restriction (TFRs) along the route of flight  

# Nighttime  

Night flying requires special consideration.  

If the trip includes flying at night over water or unpopulated areaswith the chance of losingvisual reference to the horizon, the pilot must be prepared toflyIFR. Will the flight conditions allow a safe emergency landing at night? Perform preflight check of all aircraft lights, interion and exterior, for a night flight.Carry at least two flashlights-oneforexterior preflight and a smaller one that can be dimmed and kept nearby  

#  $E=$  External Pressures  

External pressures are influences external to the flight that create a sense of pressure to complete a flightoften at the expense of safety.Factors that can be external pressures include the following:  

Someone waiting at the airport for the flight's arrival A passenger the pilot does not want to disappoint Thedesire to demonstrate pilot qualifications The desire to impress someone (Probably the two most dangerous words in aviation are “Watch this!") The desire to satisfy a specific personal goal ("get- home-itis,"“get-there-itis,” and "let's-go-itis") The pilot's general goal-completion orientation  

Emotional pressure associated with acknowledging that skill and experience levels maybe lower than a pilot would like them tobe.Pride can be a powerful externalfactor!  

ManagingExternalPressures  

Management of external pressure is the single most important keytoriskmanagementbecauseitis theoneriskfactor category that can cause a pilot to ignore all theother risk factors.External pressures put time-related pressure on the pilot and figure into a majority of accidents.  

The use of personal standard operating procedures(SOPs)is one way to manage external pressures.The goal is to supply a release for the external pressures of a flight. These procedures include but are not limited to:  

Allow time on a tripfor anextrafuelstop or tomake an unexpected landing because of weather. Have alternate plans for a late arrival or make backup airline reservations for must-be-theretrips. Forreally important trips,plan toleave early enough so that there would still betimetodriveto the destination,ifnecessary.  

# Pilot  

A pilot must continually make decisions about competency, condition of health, mental and emotional state, level of fatigue, and many other variables.Forexample,apilot maybe called early in the morning to make along flight.lf a pilot has had only a few hours of sleep and is concerned that the congestion being experienced could be theonsetofacold,itwould be prudent to consider if the flight could be accomplished safely  

A pilot had only 4 hours of sleep the night before being asked bythebosstoflytoameetinginacity750milesaway.The reported weather was marginal and not expected to improve. After assessing fitness as a pilot,it was decided that it would notbewise tomaketheflight.The boss was initially unhappy but later convinced by the pilot that the risks involved were unacceptable.  

# Environment  

This encompasses many elements not pilot or airplane related. It can include such factors as weather,air traffic control, navigational aids(NAVAIDS),terrain,takeoff and landing areas,and surrounding obstacles.Weather is one element that can change drastically overtime and distance.  

A pilot was landing a small airplane just after a heavy jet had departed a parallel runway.The pilot assumed that wake turbulence would not be a problem since landings had been performed under similar circumstances.Due toa combination ofprevailingwindsandwaketurbulencefromtheheavyjet drifting across the landing runway, the airplane made a hard landing.The pilot made an error when assessing the flight environment.  

Advise thosewho arewaiting at the destination that the arrival may be delayed.Know how to notify them when delays are encountered. Manage passengers’expectations.Make sure passengers know that they might not arrive on a firm schedule, and if they must arrive by a certain time, they should make alternative plans. Eliminate pressure to return home, even on a casual day flight, by carrying a small overnight kit containing prescriptions,contact lens solutions,toiletries,or other necessities on everyflight.  

The key to managing external pressure is to be ready for and accept delays.Rememberthat people get delayed when traveling on airlines, driving a car, or taking a bus. The pilot's goal is to manage risk, not create hazards. [Figure 2-7]  

# HumanFactors  

Why arehuman conditions,such as fatigue,complacency and stress, so important in aviation? These conditions, along with many others, are called human factors.Human factors directlycause or contribute to many aviation accidents and  

# Aircraft  

A pilotwill frequentlybase decisions on theevaluations of the aircraft, such as performance, equipment, or airworthiness.  

During a preflight, a pilot noticed a small amount of oil dripping from thebottom of thecowling.Although thequantity of oil seemed insignificant at the time,the pilot decided to delay the takeoff and have a mechanic check the source of the oil. The pilot's good judgment was confirmed when the mechanic found that one of the oil cooler hose fittings was loose.  

# Externalpressures  

The interaction between the pilot,airplane,and the environment is greatly influenced by the purpose of each flight operation. The pilot must evaluate the three previous areas to decide on the desirability of undertaking or continuing the flight as planned It is worth asking why the flight isbeingmade,howcritical is it to maintain the schedule,and is the trip worth the risks?  

On a ferry flight to deliver an airplane from the factory, in marginal weather conditions,the pilot calculated the groundspeed and determined thatthe airplanewould arriveat the destination with only 10 minutes of fuel remaining.Thepilot was determined to keep on schedule by trying to“stretch" the fuel supply instead of landing to refuel.After landing with low fuel state, the pilot realized that this could have easily resulted in an emergency landing in deteriorating weather conditions. This was a chance that was not worth taking to keep the plannedschedule.  

have been documented as a primary contributor to more than 70 percent of aircraft accidents.  

Typically, human factor incidents/accidents are associated withflight operations but recentlyhave alsobecome a majon concern in aviation maintenance and air traffic management as well.[Figure2-8]Over thepastseveral years,theFAAhas made the study and research of human factors a top priority by working closely with engineers, pilots, mechanics, and ATC to apply the latest knowledge about human factors in an effort to help operators and maintainers improve safety and efficiency in their daily operations.  

Human factors science, or human factors technologies, is a multidisciplinary field incorporating contributions from psychology, engineering, industrial design, statistics, operations research, and anthropometry. It is a term that covers the scienceof understanding the properties of human capability, the application of this understanding to the design, development and deployment of systems and services, and the art of ensuring successful application of human factor principles into all aspects of aviation to include pilots, ATC, and aviation maintenance. Human factors is often considered synonymous with CRM or maintenance resource management(MRM)but is really much broader in both its knowledge base and scope.Human factors involves gathering research specific tocertain situations(i.e.,flight maintenance,stresslevels,knowledge)about human abilities, limitations, and other characteristics and applying it to tool design, machines, systems, tasks, jobs, and environments toproducesafe,comfortable,and effective human use.The entire aviation community benefitsgreatly from human factorsresearch and development asit helpsbetter understand how humans can most safely and efficiently perform their jobs and improve the tools and systems in which they interact.  

# Human Behavior  

Studies of human behavior have tried to determine an individual's predisposition to taking risks and the level of an individual's involvement in accidents. In 1951, a study regarding injury-prone children was published by Elizabeth Mechem Fuller and Helen B. Baune, of the University of Minnesota.The study was comprised of two separate groups of second grade students.Fifty-five students were considered accident repeaters and 48 students had no accidents. Both groups were from the same school of 600 and their family demographics were similar.  

The accident-free group showed a superior knowledge ofsafety,was considered industrious and cooperative  

![](images/faee24dc1b067e3a8b56cf5ca9124513d00b1f976321b9310dae7712f7c554ca.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.Human factors effects pilots,aviation maintenance technicians(AMTs) and air traffic control(ATC)  

with others, but were not considered physically inclined. The accident-repeater grouphad better gymnastic skills, was considered aggressive and impulsive, demonstrated rebellious behavior when under stress,werepoorlosers,and liked tobe the center of attention. One interpretation of this dataan adult predisposition to injury stems from childhood behavior and environment leads tothe conclusionthat any pilot group should be comprised only of pilots who are safety-conscious,industrious, and cooperative.  

Clearly,this is not only aninaccurate inference,it is impossible.Pilots are drawnfrom the general population and exhibit all types of personality traits.Thus,it is important that good decision-making skills be taught to all pilots.  

Historically,theterm"pilot error has been used to describe an accident in which an action or decision made by the pilot was the cause or a contributing factor that led to the accident.This definition also includes the pilot'sfailure to make a correct decision or take proper action. From a broader perspective, the phrase“human factors related"more aptly describes these accidents.A single decision or event does not lead to an accident,but a series of events and the resultant decisions together form a chain of events leading toanoutcome.  

Inhis article"Accident-PronePilots,"Dr.Patrick R.Veillette uses the history of"CaptainEveryman'to demonstrate how aircraft accidents are caused more by a chain of poor choices rather than one single poor choice. In the case of Captain Everyman,after agear-up landing accident,hebecame involvedin another accident while taxiing a Beech 58 P Baron out of the ramp. Interrupted by a radio call from the dispatcher, Everyman neglected to complete the fuel cross-feed check before taking off. Everyman, who was flying solo, left the right-fuel selectorin thecross-feedposition.Once aloft and cruising, he noticed a right roll tendency and corrected with aileron trim. He did not realize that both engines were feeding off the left wing's tank, making the wing lighter.  

After two hours of flight, the right engine quit when Everyman was flying along a deep canyon gorge. While he was trying totroubleshoot thecause of the rightengine's failure, the left engine quit. Everyman landed the aircraft on a river sandbar but it sank into ten feet of water.  

Several years later Everymanflewa deHavilland Twin Otter to deliver supplies to a remote location.When he returned to home base and landed, the aircraft veered sharply to the left, departed the runway, and ran into a marsh 375 feet from the runway. The airframe and engines sustained considerable damage. Upon inspecting the wreck, accident investigators found the nose wheel steering tillerin thefully deflected position. Both the after takeoff and before landing checklists require the tiller tobe placed intheneutral position Everyman had overlooked this item.  

Now, is Everyman accident prone or just unlucky? Skipping details on a checklist appears to be a common theme in the preceding accidents. While most pilots have made similar mistakes,these errors were probably caught prior to a mishap due to extra margin, good warning systems, a sharp copilot, orjustgoodluck.What makes a pilot less prone to accidents?  

The successful pilot possesses the ability to concentrate, manage workloads,and monitor and perform several simultaneous tasks.Someof thelatest psychological screenings used in aviation test applicants for their ability to multitask, measuring both accuracy, as well as the individual's ability to focus attention on several subjects simultaneously.TheFAAoversawan extensive research study on the similarities and dissimilarities of accident-free pilots and those who were not. The project surveyed over 4,000 pilots, half of whom had “clean" records while the other half had been involved in an accident.  

Five traits were discovered in pilots prone to having accidents.Thesepilots:  

Have disdain toward rules Have very high correlation between accidentson their flying records and safety violations on their driving records Frequently fallinto the"thrill and adventure seeking personality category Are impulsive rather than methodical and disciplined. both in their information gathering and in the speed and selection of actions to betaken Have a disregard for or tend to underutilize outside sources of information,including copilots,flight attendants, flight service personnel, flight instructors, andATC  

# TheDecision-MakingProcess  

An understanding of the decision-making process provides the pilot with a foundation for developing ADM and SRM skills.While some situations,such as enginefailure,require an immediate pilot response using established procedures,thereis usually timeduring aflightto analyze any changes that occur, gather information,and assess risks before reaching a decision.  

Risk management and risk interventionis much more than the simple definitions of the terms might suggest.Riskmanagement and risk intervention are decision-makingprocesses designed to systematically identify hazards, assess the degree of risk, and determine thebestcourse of action.Theseprocesses involve the identification of hazards,followed by assessments of the risks, analysis of the controls, making control decisions,using the controls,and monitoring the results  

The steps leading to this decision constitute a decision- makingprocess.Three models of a structured framework forproblem-solving and decision-makingarethe5P,the3P using PAVE,CARE and TEAM,and the DECIDE models. They provide assistance in organizing the decision process. All these modelshavebeen identified ashelpful to the single pilotin organizing critical decisions.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM)  

Single-Pilot Resource Management(SRM)isabouthowto gather information,analyze it,and make decisions.Learning how to identify problems,analyze the information,andmake informed and timely decisions is not as straightforward as the training involved in learning specific maneuvers. Learning how to judge a situation and how to think'intheendless variety of situations encountered while flying out in the"real world'ismoredifficult.  

There is no one right answer in ADM, rather each pilot is expected to analyze each situation in light of experience level, personal minimums, and current physical and mental readiness level, and make his or her own decision.  

# The 5 Ps Check  

SRM sounds good on paper, but it requires a way for pilots to understand and use it in their daily flights. One practical application is called the"FivePs(5Ps)."[Figure2-9/The 5 Ps consist of "the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming."Each of these areas consists of a set of challenges and opportunities that every pilot encounters. Each challenge and opportunity can substantially increase or decrease the risk of successfully completing the flight based on the pilot's ability to makeinformed and timely decisions. The  $5\;\mathrm{Ps}$  areused toevaluate thepilot's current situation at key decision points during the flight or when an emergency  

![](images/18e24251eefd5de73575a7e5dcb21cc069a1cc66519060daa5614aeece3cef23.jpg)  
Figure2-9.The Five Ps checklist  

arises. These decision points include preflight, pretakeoff hourly or at the midpoint of the flight, pre-descent, and just prior to the final approach fix or for VFR operations, just prior to entering thetraffic pattern.  

The  $5~\mathrm{Ps}$  arebased on theidea that pilots have essentially five variables that impact his or her environment and forcing him or her to make a single critical decision, or several less critical decisions, that when added together can create a critical outcome. These variables are the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming. This concept stems from the belief that current decision-makingmodels tended to be reactionary in nature. A change has to occur andbedetected todrive a riskmanagement decisionby the pilot. For instance, many pilots complete risk management sheetsprior totakeoff.These form a catalog of risks that may be encountered that day.Each of these risks is assigned a numerical value.If the total of these numerical values exceeds a predetermined level, the flight is altered or cancelled.Informal research shows that while these are useful documents for teaching riskfactors,they are almost never used outside of formal training programs. The 5P concept is an attempt to take the information contained in those sheets andintheother availablemodelsanduseit.  

The 5P concept relies on the pilot to adopt a “scheduled" review of the critical variables at points in the flight where decisions are most likely to be effective. For instance, the easiestpoint tocancel a flightdue tobad weatherisbefore the pilot and passengers walkout thedoor andload the aircraft. So the first decision point is preflight in the flight planning room, where all the information is readily available to make asounddecision,and where communication and Fixed Base Operator (FBO)services are readily available tomake alternate travel plans.  

The second easiest point in the flight to make a critical safety decision is just prior to takeoff. Few pilots have ever had tomake an“emergency takeoff."While thepointofthe5P check is tohelp the pilot fly, the correct application of the 5 P before takeoff is to assist in making a reasoned go/no-go decision based on all theinformation available.That decision will usually be to “go,” with certain restrictions and changes, but may also be a ^no-go." The key idea is that these two points in the process of flying are critical go/no-go points on each and every flight  

The third place to review the  $5~\mathrm{Ps}$  is at the midpoint of the flight. Often, pilots may wait until the Automated Terminal information Service (ATIS) is in range to check weather, yet, at this point in the flight, many good options have already passed behind the aircraft and pilot.Additionally,fatigue and low-altitude hypoxia serve to rob the pilot of much of his or her energy by the end of a long and tiring flight day. Thisleads toa transitionfroma decision-makingmodeto an acceptance mode on the part of the pilot. If theflight islonger than2hours,the5 P check should be conducted hourly.  

The last two decision points are just prior to descent into the terminal area and just prior tothefinal approach fix,or if VFR, just prior to entering the traffic pattern as preparations for landing commence. Most pilots execute approaches with the expectation that they will land out of the approach every time. A healthier approach requires the pilot to assume that changing conditions(the  $5~\mathrm{ps}$  again)will cause the pilot to divert or execute the missed approach on every approach. This keeps the pilot alert to all manner of conditions that may increase risk and threaten the safe conduct of the flight Diverting from cruise altitude saves fuel,allowsunhurried use of the autopilot and is less reactive in nature. Diverting fromthefinal approachfix,while more difficult,still allows the pilot to plan and coordinate better, rather than executing a futile missed approach. Let's look at a detailed discussion of each of the Five Ps.  

# ThePlan  

The"Plan"can also be called the mission or the task.It contains the basic elements of cross-country planning, weather, route, fuel, publications currency, etc. The "Plan" should be reviewed and updated several times during the course of theflight.A delayed takeoff due tomaintenance, fast moving weather, and a short notice TFR may all radically alter the plan. The "plan" is not only about the flight plan, but also all the events thatsurround theflight and allowthe pilot to accomplish the mission. The plan is always being updated and modified andis especially responsive to changes in the other four remaining Ps. If for no other reason, the  $5\,\mathrm{P}$  check reminds the pilot that the day's flight plan is real life and subject tochange at anytime.  

Obviously,weatheris ahugepartof anyplan.The addition of data link weather information gives the advanced avionics pilota real advantage in inclement weather,butonlyif the pilotistrainedtoretrieveandevaluatetheweatherinreal time without sacrificing situational awareness.Andofcourse, weather information should drive a decision,evenifthat decision is to continue on the current plan.Pilots of aircraft without datalinkweather should get updated weather in flight through an FSS and/or Flight Watch.  

# ThePlane  

Both the“plan"and the“plane"arefairly familiar tomost pilots. The "plane” consists of the usual array of mechanical and cosmeticissues that every aircraft pilot,owner,or operator can identify. With the advent of advanced avionics, the“plane"has expanded to include database currency, automation status,and emergency backup systems that were unknown a few years ago. Much has been written about singlepilot IFRflight,bothwith andwithout an autopilot While this is a personal decision,itisjust thatadecision. Low IFR in a non-autopilot equipped aircraft may depend on several of the other Ps to be discussed.Pilot proficiency currency,and fatigue are among them.  

# ThePilot  

Flying, especially when business transportation is involved, can expose a pilot to risks such as high altitudes, long trips requiring significant endurance, and challenging weather. Advanced avionics, when installed, can expose a pilot to high stresses because of the inherent additional capabilities which are available. When dealing with pilot risk, it is always best to consult the “IMSAFE"checklist (see page 2-6).  

The combination of late nights, pilot fatigue, and the effects ofsustainedflightabove5,ooofeetmaycausepilotsto become less discerning, less critical of information, less decisive, and more compliant and accepting. Just as the most critical portion of the flight approaches (for instance a night instrument approach,in the weather, after a 4-hour flight), the pilot's guard is down the most. The  $5\mathrm{~P~}$  processhelpsa pilot recognize the physiological challenges that they may face towards the end of theflight prior to takeoff and allows them to update personal conditions as the flight progresses. Once risks are identified, the pilot is in a better place to makealternateplansthatlessentheeffectofthesefactors and provide asafersolution.  

# ThePassengers  

One of thekey differences between CRM andSRM is the way passengers interact with the pilot. The pilot of a highly capable single-engine aircraft maintains a much more personal relationship with the passengers ashe/she is positioned within an arm's reach of them throughout the flight.  

The necessity of the passengers to make airline connections or important business meetings in a timely manner enters into this pilot's decision-making loop.Consider a flight to Dulles Airport in which and the passengers, both close friends and business partners, need to get to Washington, D.C.for an important meeting. The weather isVFR all the way to southern Virginia, then turns to low IFR as the pilot approaches Dulles.A pilot employing the  $^{5\mathrm{~P~}}$  approach might consider reserving a rental car at an airport in northern NorthCarolina or southern Virginia to coincide with a refueling stop. Thus, the passengers have a way to get to Washington, and the pilot has an out to avoid being pressured into continuing theflight if the conditions donotimprove.  

Passengers can also be pilots. If no one is designated as pilot in command (PIC) and unplanned circumstances arise, the decision-making styles of several self-confident pilotsmay comeintoconflict  

Pilots also need to understand that non-pilots may not understand thelevelof risk involved inflight.Thereis an element of risk in every flight. That is whySRM calls it risk management, not risk elimination. While a pilot may feel comfortable with the risk present in a night IFR flight, the passengers may not.A pilot employing SRM should ensure the passengers are involved in the decision-making and given tasks and duties to keep them busy and involved. If, upon a factual description of the risks present, the passengers decide to buy an airline ticketorrent acar,then a good decision has generally been made. This discussion also allows the pilot to move past what he or she thinks the passengers want to do and find out what they actually want to do.Thisremoves self-induced pressure from the pilot  

# TheProgramming  

The advanced avionics aircraft adds an entirely new dimension to theway GA aircraft areflown.Theelectronic instrument displays, GPS,and autopilot reduce pilot workload and increase pilot situational awareness. While programming and operation of these devices are fairly simple and straightforward, unlike the analog instruments theyreplace,theytend to capturethepilot's attention and hold it for long periods of time. To avoid this phenomenon, the pilot should plan in advance when and where the programming for approaches, route changes, and airport information gathering should be accomplished,as well as times it should not. Pilot familiarity with the equipment, the route, the local ATC environment, and personal capabilities vis-a-vis the automation should drive when, where, and how the automation is programmed and used.  

The pilot should also consider what his or her capabilities are in response tolast minute changes of the approach (and the reprogramming required) and ability to makelarge-scale changes (are route for instance)whilehand flying the aircraft Since formats are not standardized,simply moving from one manufacturer's equipment to another should give the pilot pause and require more conservative planning and decisions.  

The SRM process is simple.Atleast five times before and during the flight, the pilot should review and consider the“Plan,the Plane,the Pilot,the Passengers,and the Programming” and make the appropriate decision required by the current situation.It is often said that failure to make a decision is a decision.Under SRM and the  $5\;\mathrm{Ps}$  eventhe decision tomakenochanges to thecurrentplan ismade through a careful consideration of all the risk factors present.  

# Perceive,Process,Perform(3P)Mode  

ThePerceive,Process,Perform (3P)model for ADMoffers a simple, practical, and systematic approach that can be used during all phases of flight. To use it, the pilot will:  

Perceive the given set of circumstances for aflight Process by evaluating their impact on flight safety Perform by implementing the best course of action  

UsethePerceive,Process,Perform,and Evaluate method as a continuous model for every aeronautical decision thatyou make. Although human beings will inevitably make mistakes, anything thatyou can do to recognize and minimize potential threats toyour safetywill makeyou a better pilot.  

Dependingupon thenatureof the activity and the time available, risk management processing can take place in any of three time frames.[Figure2-1o]Most flight training activities take place in the“time-critical"timeframefor riskmanagement.The sixsteps of risk management can be combined into an easy-to-remember 3P model for practical riskmanagement:Perceive,Process,Perform with the PAVE, CARE and TEAM checklists.Pilots can help perceive hazards by using the PAVE checklist of: Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures. They can process hazards by using the CARE checklist of: Consequences, Alternatives, Reality, External factors. Finally, pilots can perform risk management by using the TEAM choice list of:Transfer,Eliminate,Accept,orMitigate.  

# PAVEChecklist:IdentifyHazardsandPersonal Minimums  

In the first step,the goal is to develop situational awareness by perceiving hazards, which are present events, objects, or circumstances that could contribute to an undesired future event. In this step, the pilot will systematically identify and  

![](images/686147fe54e0b59e378f00526e3e90998891c78d0b966dd7f74d20ab49ed1688.jpg)

list hazards associatedwith all aspectsof theflight:Pilot Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures, which makes up the PAVE checklist.[Figure2-1l]Foreachelement, ask “what could hurt me, my passengers, or my aircraft?"" Allfourelementscombineandinteracttocreateaunique situationfor any flight.Pay special attention to the pilot- aircraft combination,and consider whether the combined "pilot-aircraft team'is capable of the mission you want tofly. Forexample,youmaybe a very experienced andproficient pilot,but your weather flying ability is still limited if you areflyinga1970s-model aircraft with no weather avoidance gear.On the other hand,you mayhave a new technically advanced aircraft with moving map GPS, weather datalink, and autopilotbut if you do not have much weather flying experience or practice in using this kind of equipment, you cannot rely on the airplane's capability to compensate for your own lack of experience.  

# CAREChecklist:ReviewHazardsandEvaluateRisks  

Inthesecondstep,the goal is to process this information to determine whether the identified hazards constitute risk,which is defined as the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled or eliminated. The degree of risk posed by a given hazard canbemeasuredintermsofexposure(numberofpeopleor resources affected),severity(extentof possibleloss),and probability (the likelihood that a hazard will cause a loss). The goal is to evaluate their impact on the safety of your flight andconsider“whymustICARE about these circumstances?"  

Foreachhazard that you perceived instepone,process by using the CARE checklist of: Consequences, Alternatives. Reality, External factors. [Figure 2-12] For example,let's evaluate a night flight to attend a business meeting:  

Consequences—departing after a full workday creates fatigue andpressure  

Alternatives—delay until morning; reschedule meeting; drive Reality —dangers and distractions of fatigue could leadtoanaccident External pressures-—-business meeting at destination might influenceme  

A good rule of thumb for the processing phase: if you find yourself sayingthatit will"probably"be okay,itis definitely time for a solid reality check. If you are worried about missing ameeting,be realistic about how that pressure will affect not just your initial go/no-go decision,but also your inflight decisions to continue the flight or divert  

# TEAM Checklist:Choose andImplementRisk Controls  

Once you have perceived a hazard(stepone)andprocessed its impact on flight safety (step two),it is time to move to the thirdstep,perform.Perform risk management by using the TEAM checklist of: Transfer,Eliminate,Accept,Mitigate to deal with each factor.[Figure2-13]  

TransferShould this risk decision be transferred to someone else (e.g., do you need to consult the chief flight instructor?)  

Eliminate—-Is there a way to eliminate the hazard?  

Accept—Do the benefits of accepting risk outweigh thecosts?  

Mitigate——- What can you do to mitigate the risk?  

Thegoal is to perform by taking action to eliminate hazards or mitigate risk, and then continuously evaluate the outcome of this action.With the example of low ceilings at destination, for instance, the pilot can perform good ADM by selecting a suitable alternate,knowingwhere to find good weather,

and carrying sufficient fuel to reach it. This course of action would mitigate the risk. The pilot also has the option to eliminateit entirely by waitingfor better weather.  

Once the pilothas completed the 3 P decision process and selected a course of action,the process begins anewbecause now the set of circumstances brought about by the course of action requires analysis.Thedecision-making process is a continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing. With practice and consistent use, running through the 3P cycle can become a habit that is assmooth,continuous,and automatic as a well-honed instrument scan. This basic set of practical risk management tools can be used to improve riskmanagement.  

Your mental willingness tofollow through onsafe decisions, especially those that require delay or diversion is critical.You can bulk upyour mental muscles by:  

Using personal minimums checklist to make some decisions in advance of the flight. To develop a good personal minimums checklist,you need to assess your abilities and capabilities in a non-flying environment, when there is no pressure to make a specific trip. Once developed, a personal minimums checklist will give  

you a clear and concise reference point for making your go/no-go or continue/discontinue decisions. In addition to having personal minimums, some pilots alsolike to use a preflight risk assessment checklist to helpwith theADM and risk management processes. This kind of form assigns numbers to certain risks andsituations,whichcanmakeiteasiertoseewhen a particular flight involves ahigherlevelof risk Develop a list of good alternatives during your processing phase. In marginal weather, for instance, you might mitigate the risk byidentifying a reasonable  

# Pilots can perform risk management by using the TEAM checklist:  

# Pilot  

To manage the risk associated with her inexperience and lack of recent flight time,Gaylecan: Transfer the risk entirely by having another pilot act as PlC. Eliminate the risk by canceling the trip. Accept the risk and fly anyway. Mitigate the risk by flying with another pilot.  

Gayle chooses to mitigate the major risk by hiring a CFl to accompany her and provide dual cross-country instruction. An added benefit is the opportunity to broaden her flying experience.  

# Environment  

To manage the risk associated with hazy conditions and mountainous terrain,Gayle can: Transfer therisk of VFR in these conditions by asking an instrument-rated pilot to fly the trip under IFR. Eliminate the risk by canceling the trip. Accepttherisk. Mitigate the risk by careful preflight planning, filing a VFR flight plan, requesting VFR flight following, and using resources such as Flight Watch.  

Detailed preflight planning must beavital part of Gayle's weather risk mitigation strategy. The most direct route would putherover mountains for most of the trip.Becauseof the thick haze and pockets of iM Cover mountains,Gaylemight mitigate the risk by modifying the route to fly over valleys. This change will add 30 minutes to her estimated time of arrival (ETA), but the extra time is a small price to pay for avoiding possible IMC over mountains.Because her destination airport is IMC at the time of departure, Gayle needs to establish that VFR conditions exist at other airports within easy driving distance of her original destination.Inaddition,Gayleshould review basic information (e.g., traffic pattern altitude, runway layout, frequencies) for these alternate airports. To further mitigaterisk and practice good cockpit resource management. Gayle should file a VFR flight plan, use VFR flight following, and call Flight Watch to get weather updates en route. Finally, basic functions on her handheld GPS should also be practiced  

alternative airport for every 25-30nauticalmile segment of your route.  

Preflight your passengers by preparing them for the possibility of delay and diversion, and involve them in your evaluation process.  

Another important tool overlooked by many pilots isagoodpost-flightanalysis.When you have safely secured the airplane,take the time to review and analyze theflight as objectively as you can.Mistakes and judgment errors are inevitable; the most important thing is for you to recognize, analyze, and learn from them beforeyour next flight.  

# Aircraft  

To manage risk associated with any doubts about the aircraft's mechanical condition,Gaylecan: Transfer the risk by using a different airplane. Eliminate the risk by canceling the trip. Accepttherisk. Mitigate theremaining (residual) risk through review of aircraft performance and careful pre flight inspection.  

Since she finds no problems with the aircraft'smechanical condition, Gayle chooses to mitigate any remaining risk through careful preflight inspection of the aircraft.  

# Externalpressures  

Tomitigatetheriskofemotionalpressurefromfamily expectations that can drive a "get-there” mentality, Gayle can: Transfer the risk by having her co-pilot act as PlC and make thecontinue/divertdecision. Eliminate the risk by canceling the trip Accepttherisk. Mitigate the risk by managing family expectations and making alternative arrangements in the event of diversion to anotherairport.  

Gayle and her co-pilot choose to address this risk by agreeing that each pilot has a veto on continuing the flight, and that they willdivert if either becomes uncomfortable with flight conditions BecausethedestinationairportisstilliMCatthetimeof departure,Gayleestablishes a specificpoint inthe trip—an en route V ORTAC located between the destination airportand the two alternates—as the logical place for her"final"continue/ divert decision. Rather than give her family a specific ETA that might make Gayle feel pressured to meet the schedule,she manages her family's expectations by advising them that she willcallwhenshearrives.  

# TheDECIDEModel  

Using the acronym"DECIDE,”the six-step process DECIDE Model is another continuous loop process that provides the pilotwith a logical way of making decisions.[Figure2-14] DECIDE means toDetect,Estimate,Choose a course of action,Identify solutions, Do the necessary actions, and Evaluatetheeffectsoftheactions.  

First,considera recent accident involving a Piper Apache(PA 23).The aircraft was substantially damaged during impact with terrain at a local airport in Alabama. The certificated airline transport pilot (ATP)received minorinjuries and the certificated private pilot was not injured. The private pilot was receiving a check ride from the ATP(whowasalsoa designated examiner)for a commercial pilot certificate with a multi-engine rating.After performing airwork at altitude, they returned to the airport and the private pilot performed a single-engine approachtoafull stoplanding.He thentaxied back for takeoff, performed a short field takeoff, and then joined the traffic pattern to return for another landing. During the approach for the second landing, the ATP simulated aright engine failure by reducing power on the right engine to zero thrust.Thiscaused the aircraft toya wright.  

The procedure to identify the failed engine is a two-step process.First, adjust the power to the maximum controllable level onboth engines.Because theleftengine isthe only engine delivering thrust, the yawincreases to the right, which necessitates applicationof additionalleft rudder application.  

![](images/13f6923a74be0afb29fc909afc9fa473f9adba9d46b7ef68bd69303d06026504.jpg)  
Aeronautical Decision-Making  

![TheDECIDEmodel ](images/b9bb4b85efa67361611e33ae453c38367cbc97fa08ea88bc7ff82e2c0afaabed.jpg)  

The failed engine is thesidethat requires no rudder pressure in this case the right engine. Second, having identified the failed right engine, the procedure is to feather the right engine and adjust power to maintain descent angle to a landing.  

However,in this case the pilotfeathered theleft engine because he assumed the engine failure was a left engine failure. During twin-engine training, the left engine out is emphasized more than the right engine because the left engine on most light twins is the critical engine. This is due to multiengine airplanes beingsubjecttoP-factor,asaresingle-engineairplanes. The descending propeller blade of each engine will produce greater thrust than the ascending blade when the airplane is operated under power and at positive angles of attack. The descending propeller blade of the right engine is also a greater distance from the center of gravity, and therefore has a longer moment arm than the descending propeller blade of the left engine. As a result, failure of the left engine will result in the most asymmetrical thrust (adverse yaw) because the right engine will be providing the remaining thrust. Many twins are designed with a counter-rotating right engine. With this design, the degree of asymmetrical thrust is the same with either engine inoperative. Neither engine is more critical than the other.  

Since the pilot never executed the first step of identifying which engine failed,he feathered the left engine and set the right engine at zero thrust.This essentially restricted the aircraft to a controlled glide.Upon realizing that he was not going to make the runway, the pilot increased power to both engines causing an enormous yaw to the left (the left propellerwasfeathered)whereupon the aircraftstarted toturn left.Indesperation,the instructor closed both throttles and the aircraft hit the ground and was substantially damaged  

This case is interesting because it highlights two particular issues.First,taking action without forethought can be just as dangerous as taking no action at all.Inthiscase,the pilot's actions were incorrect;yet,there was sufficient time to take the necessary steps to analyze the simulated emergency. The second and more subtleissueis that decisions made under pressure are sometimes executed based upon limited experience and the actions taken maybe incorrect incomplete,or insufficient to handle the situation.  

# Detect(theProblem)  

Problem detection is the first step in the decision-making process. It begins with recognizing a change occurred or an expected change did not occur.A problem is perceived first by the senses and then it is distinguished through insight and experience.Thesesame abilities,as well as an objective analysisofallavailableinformation,areusedtodetermine thenatureandseverityoftheproblem.Onecriticalerror made during the decision-making process is incorrectly detecting the problem. In the previous example, the change that occurred was a yaw.  

# Estimate(theNeed ToReact)  

In the engine-out example, the aircraft yawed right, the pilot was on final approach, and the problem warranted a prompt solution. In many cases, overreaction and fixation excludes a safeoutcome.Forexample,what if thecabindoor of a Mooney suddenly opened in flight while the aircraft climbed through 1,500 feet on a clear sunny day? The sudden opening would be alarming, but the perceived hazard the open door presents is quickly and effectively assessed as minor. In fact, the door's opening would not impact safe flight and can almost be disregarded. Most likely, a pilot would return to the airport tosecure the door after landing.  

The pilot flying on a clear day faced with this minor problem may rank the open cabin door as a low risk.Whatabout the pilot on an IFR climb out in IMC conditions with light intermittent turbulence in rain who is receiving an amended clearance from ATC?The open cabin door now becomes a higher risk factor. The problem has not changed, but the perception of risk a pilot assigns it changes because of the multitude of ongoing tasks and the environment. Experience, discipline, awareness, and knowledge influences how a pilot ranksaproblem.  

# Choose (a Course of Action)  

After the problem has been identified and its impact estimated, the pilot must determine the desirable outcome and choose a course of action.In thecase of themultiengine pilot given the simulated failed engine, the desired objective is tosafely land the airplane.  

# Identify(Solutions)  

The pilot formulates a plan thatwill takehim or her to the objective.Sometimes,theremaybe only one course of action available.In the case of the engine failure already at 500 feet or below, the pilot solves the problem by identifying one or more solutions that lead to a successful outcome.Itis important for the pilot not to become fixated on the process to the exclusion of making a decision.  

# Do (the Necessary Actions)  

Once pathways to resolution are identified, the pilot selects the most suitable onefor the situation.The multiengine pilot given the simulated failed engine must now safely land the aircraft.  

# Evaluate (theEffect of the Action)  

Finally, after implementing a solution,evaluate the decision to see if it was correct. If the action taken does not provide the desired results, the process may have to be repeated.  

# Decision-Making in a Dynamic Environment  

A solid approachto decision-making is throughtheuse of analytical models,suchasthe5Ps,3P,andDECIDE.Good decisions result when pilots gather all available information, reviewit, analyze the options,rate the options,select acourse ofaction,and evaluate that course of action for correctness.  

In some situations,there is not always time to make decisions based on analytical decision-making skills. A good example is a quarterback whose actions are based upon ahighlyfluid and changing situation. He intends to execute a plan, but new circumstances dictate decision-making on the fly. This type ofdecision-making is called automatic decision-making on naturalized decision-making.[Figure2-l4B]  

# Automatic Decision-Making  

In an emergency situation,a pilot might not survive if he or she rigorously applies analytical models to every decision made as there is not enough time togo through all the options Under these circumstances he orshe should attempt tofind the best possible solution to everyproblem.  

For the past several decades,research into how people actually make decisions has revealed that when pressed for time,experts faced with a task loaded with uncertainty first assess whether the situation strikes them as familiar.Rather than comparing the pros and cons of different approaches, they quickly imagine how one or a few possible courses of action in such situations will play out.Experts take thefirst workable option they can find.While it may not be the best of all possible choices, it often yields remarkably good results  

The terms “naturalistic' and “automatic decision-making’ have been coined to describe this type of decision-making. The ability to make automatic decisions holds true for a range of experts from firefighters to chess players. It appears theexpert's ability hinges on the recognition of patterns and consistencies that clarify options in complex situations. Experts appear to make provisional sense of a situation, without actually reaching a decision,by launching experience-based actions that in turn trigger creative revisions.  

This is a reflexive type of decision-making anchored in training and experience and is most often used in times of emergencies when there is no time to practice analytical decision-making. Naturalistic or automatic decision-making improves with training and experience, and a pilot will find himself or herself using a combination of decision-making tools that correlate with individual experience and training  

# Operational Pitfalls  

Although more experienced pilots are likely to make more automatic decisions, there are tendencies or operational pitfalls that come with the development of pilot experience. Theseare classic behavioral traps into which pilots have been known to fall. More experienced pilots, as a rule, try to complete a flight asplanned,please passengers,and meet schedules.The desire to meet these goals can have an adverse effect on safety and contribute to an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills. All experienced pilots have fallen prey to, or have been tempted by, one or more of these tendencies in their flying careers. These dangerous tendencies or behavior patterns, which must be identified and eliminated, include the operational pitfalls shownin Figure2-15.  

# Stress Management  

Everyoneis stressed tosome degree almost all of thetime.A certain amount of stress is good since it keeps a person alert and prevents complacency.Effects of stress are cumulative and, if the pilot does not cope with them in an appropriate way, they can eventually add up to an intolerable burden. Performance generally increases with the onset of stress, peaks, and then begins to fall off rapidly as stress levels exceed a person's ability to cope. The ability to make effective decisions during flight can be impaired by stress. Therearetwocategoriesofstressacuteandchronic.These are both explained in Chapter 17,“Aeromedical Factors."  

Factors referred to as stress or s can increase a pilot'sriskof error in the flight deck. [Figure 2-16] Remember the cabin door that suddenly opened inflight on theMooney climbing through 1,500feet on a clear sunny day? It may startle the pilot, but the stress would wane when it became apparent the situation was not a serious hazard.Yet,if thecabindoor opened in IMC conditions, the stress level makes significant impact on the pilot's ability to cope with simple tasks. The key to stress management is to stop,think,and analyzebefore jumping to a conclusion.There is usually time to thinkbefore drawing unnecessary conclusions.  

There are several techniques to help manage the accumulation of life stresses and prevent stress overload.For example, to help reduce stress levels,set aside time for relaxation each day or maintain a program of physical fitness. To prevent stressoverload,learn to manage time more effectively to avoid pressures imposed by gettingbehind schedule and not meeting deadlines.  

# UseofResources  

To make informed decisions during flight operations, a pilot must also become aware of the resources found inside and outside theflightdeck.Since useful tools and sourcesof information may not always be readily apparent, learning to recognize these resources is an essential part of ADM training. Resources must not only be identified, but a pilot must also develop the skills to evaluate whether there is  

# Operational Pitfalls  

# Peerpressure  

Poor decision-making may be based upon an emotional response to peers, rather than evaluating a situation objectively.  

Mindset  

A pilot displays mind set through an inability to recognize and cope with changes in a given situation.  

# Get-there-itis  

This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a disregard for any alternative course of action.  

# Duck-undersyndrome  

A pilot may be tempted to make it into an airport by descending below minimums during an approach. There may be a belief that there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or a pilot may want to admit that the landing cannot be completed and a missed approach must be initiated.  

# Scud running  

This occurs when a pilot tries to maintain visual contact with the terrain at low altitudes while instrument conditions exist  

Continuingvisual flightrules(VFR)intoinstrumentconditions Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles may occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can be even more dangerous if the pilot is not instrument rated or current  

# Getting behind the aircraft  

This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant state of surprise at what happens next may be exhibited when the pilot is getting behind the aircraft.  

# Loss of positional or situational awareness  

In extreme cases, when a pilot gets behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or situational awareness may result. The pilot may not knowtheaircraft'sgeographical locationor maybe unable to recognize deteriorating circumstances.  

# Operating without adequate fuel reserves  

Ignoring minimum fuel reserve requirements is generally the result of overconfidence, lack of flight planning, or disregarding applicable regulations.  

Descent below the minimum en route altitude  

The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the en route portion of an IFR flight  

Flyingoutside the envelope  

The assumed high performance capability of a particular aircraft may cause a mistaken belief that it can meet the demands imposedbyapilot's overestimated flying skills  

Neglect of flight planning, preflight inspections, and checklists  

A pilot may rely on short- and long-term memory, regular flying skills, and familiar routes instead of established procedures and published checklists. This can be particularly true of experienced pilots.  

Figure2-15.Typical operational pitfalls requiring pilot awareness.  

# Stressors  

# Environmental  

Conditions associated with the environment, such as temperature and humidity extremes, noise, vibration, and lack of oxygen.  

# Physiological stress  

Physical conditions, such as fatigue, lack of physical fitness, sleep loss, missed meals (leading to low blood sugar levels), and illness.  

# Psychological stress  

Social or emotional factors, such as a death in the family, a divorce, a sick child, or a demotion at work. This type of stress may also be related to mental workload, such as analyzing a problem, navigating an aircraft, or making decisions.  

Figure2-16.Systemstressors.Environmental,physiological,and psychological stress are factors that affect decision-makingskills These stress or s have a profound impact especially during periods of high workload.  

time to use a particular resource and the impact its use will have upon the safety of flight. For example, the assistance of ATC maybevery useful if a pilot becomes lost,but in anemergency situation,theremaybe notime available to contactATC.  

# Internal Resources  

One of the most under utilized resources maybe the person in the right seat, even if the passenger has no flying experience. When appropriate, the PIC can ask passengers to assist with certain tasks,such as watching for traffic or reading checklist items.Thefollowing are some other ways a passenger can assist:  

Provide information in an irregular situation, especially if familiar with flying. A strange smell on sound may alert a passenger to a potential problem. Confirm after the pilot that the landing gear is down Learn to look at the altimeter for a given altitude in a descent. Listen to logic or lack of logic  

Also,the process of a verbal briefing(which canhappen whether or not passengers are aboard) can help the PIC in the decision-making process. For example, assume a pilot provides a lone passenger a briefing of the forecast landing weather before departure.When the Automatic Terminal Information Service(ATIS) is picked up,the weather has significantly changed.The discussion of this forecast change can lead the pilot to reexamine his orher activities and decision-making.[Figure2-17]Other valuable internal resources include ingenuity, aviation knowledge, and flying skill. Pilots can increase flight deck resources by improving these characteristics.  

When flying alone, another internal resource is verbal communication.It has been established that verbal communication reinforces an activity; touching an object while communicating further enhances theprobability an activity has been accomplished. For this reason, many solo pilots read the checklist out loud; when they reach critical items, they touch the switch or control. For example, to ascertain the landing gear is down, the pilot can read the checklist.But,if he or she touches the gear handle during the process, a safe extension of the landing gear is confirmed.  

It is necessary for a pilot to have a thorough understanding of all the equipment and systems in the aircraft being flown. Lack of knowledge, such as knowing if the oil pressure gauge is direct reading or uses a sensor, is the difference between making a wise decision or poor one that leads to atragicerror.  

![](images/339f34358336d68e556bffba81cbffa022f60327f946364562e9e2b55fbbe3b8.jpg)  
Figure2-17.Whenpossible,have a passenger re confirm that critical tasks are completed.  

Checklists are essential flight deck internal resources. They areusedtoverifytheaircraftinstrumentsandsystemsare checked, set, and operating properly, as well as ensuring the proper procedures are performed if thereisasystem malfunction or in-flight emergency. Students reluctant to use checklists can be reminded that pilots at all levels off experiencerefer tochecklists,and that themore advanced the aircraftis,the more crucial checklists become.In addition,the pilot's operating handbook(POH)is required tobe carried on board the aircraft andis essential for accurateflight planning and resolving in-flight equipment malfunctions. However, the most valuable resource a pilot has is the abilitytomanage workload whether alone or with others.  

# External Resources  

ATC and flight service specialists are the best external resources duringflight.In order topromote the safe,orderly flow of air traffic around airports and, along flight routes, the ATC provides pilots with traffic advisories, radar vectors, and assistance in emergency situations. Although it is the PIC's responsibility to make the flight as safe as possible. a pilot with a problem can request assistance from ATC. [Figure 2-18] For example, if a pilot needs tolevel off, be

given a vector, or decrease speed, ATC assists and becomes integrated aspart of the crew.The services provided byATC can not only decrease pilot workload, but also help pilots makeinformed in-flight decisions.  

The Flight Service Stations(FSSs)are air traffic facilities that provide pilot briefing, en route communications, VFR search and rescue services,assistlost aircraft and aircraft in emergency situations, relay ATC clearances, originate NoticestoAirmen(NOTAM),broadcastaviationweather and National AirspaceSystem(NAS)information,receive and process IFR flight plans, and monitor navigational aids (NAVAIDs).In addition, at selected locations,FSSs provide En Route Flight Advisory Service (Flight Watch), issue airport advisories,and advise Customs andImmigration of trans border flights.Selected F SSs in Alaska also provide T WEB recordings and take weather observations.  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the five fundamental risk elements (flight, pilot, aircraft, environment, and type of operation that comprise any given aviation situation)that affect safety before,during,andafter theflight. Monitoring radio communications for traffic, weather discussion,and ATC communication can enhance situational awareness by helping the pilot develop a mental picture of what is happening  

Maintaining situational awareness requires anunderstanding of the relative significance of all flight related factors and their future impact on the flight. When a pilot understands what is going on and has an overview of the total operation,he or she is not fixated on one perceived significant factor.Not only is it importantfor a pilot toknow the aircraft's geographical location, it is also important he or she understand what is happening. For instance, while flying above Richmond, Virginia, toward Dulles Airport or Leesburg, the pilot should know why he or she is being vectored and be ableto anticipate spatial location.A pilot who is simply making turns without understanding why has added an additional burden to his or her management in the event of an emergency. To maintain situational awareness,all of the skills involved in ADMareused.  

# Obstacles toMaintaining Situational Awareness  

Fatigue, stress, and work overload can cause a pilot tofixate on a single perceived important item and reduce an overall situational awareness of the flight.A contributing factor in many accidents is a distraction that diverts the pilot's attention from monitoring the instruments or scanning outside the aircraft.Many flight deck distractions begin as a minor problem, such as a gauge that is not reading correctly butresultinaccidentsasthepilotdivertsattentiontothe perceived problem and neglects proper control of the aircraft.  

# Workload Management  

Effective workload management ensures essential operations are accomplished by planning, prioritizing, and sequencing tasks to avoid work overload.[Figure2-19]Asexperience is gained,a pilot learns to recognize future workload requirements and can prepare for high workload periods during times of low workload. Reviewing the appropriate chart and setting radio frequencies well in advance of when they are needed helps reduce workload as the flight near s the airport. In addition, a pilot should listen to ATIS, Automated Surface ObservingSystem(AsOS),or Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), if available, and then monitor the towerfrequency or Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) to get a good idea of what traffic conditions to expect. Checklists should be performed well in advance so there is time to focus on traffic and ATC instructions.These procedures are especially important prior to entering a high- density traffic area, such as Class B airspace.  

Recognizing a work overload situation is also an important component of managing workload.The first effect of high workload is that the pilot may be working harder but accomplishing less.As workload increases, attention cannot be devoted to several tasks at one time, and the pilot may begin to focus on one item.When a pilot becomes task saturated,there is no awareness of input from various sources, so decisions may be made on incomplete information and the possibility of error increases.[Figure2-20]  

When a work overload situation exists, a pilot needs to stop think, slow down, and prioritize. It is important to understand how to decrease workload. For example, in the case of the cabin door that opened in VFR flight, the impact on workload should be insignificant.If the cabin door opens under IFR different conditions, its impact on workload changes. Therefore, placing a situation in the proper perspective.

Figure2-19.Balancing workloads can be a difficult task.  

remaining calm, and thinking rationally are key elements in reducingstress andincreasing the capacity tofly safely.This ability depends upon experience, discipline, and training.  

# ManagingRisks  

The ability to manage risks begins with preparation. Here aresome things a pilot can do to manage risks:  

Assess the flight's risk based upon experience. Use some form of risk assessment. For example, if the weather is marginal and the pilot has little IMC training, it is probably a good idea to cancel the flight Brief passengers using the SAFETY list: S Seat belts fastened for taxi, takeoff,landing Shoulder harness fastened for takeoff, landing Seat position adjusted and locked in place A Air vents (location and operation) All environmental controls(discussed) Action in case of any passenger discomfort F Fire extinguisher (location and operation) E Exit doors (how to secure; how to open) Emergency evacuation plan Emergency/survival kit (location and contents) T Traffic (scanning, spotting, notifying pilot) Talking, ("sterile flight deck" expectations) YYour questions? (Speak up!)  

In addition to the SAFETY list,discusswith passengers whether or not smoking is permitted,flight route altitudes,time en route,destination,weather during flight, expected weather at the destination, controls andwhattheydo,and the general capabilities and limitations of the aircraft. Use a sterile flight deck (one that is completely silent with no pilot communication with passengers or by passengers)from the time of departure to the first intermediate altitude andclearancefromthelocal airspace. Use a sterile flight deck during arrival from the first radarvectorfor approach or descent for the approach Keep the passengers informed duringtimeswhen the workloadislow. Consider using the passenger in the right seat for simple tasks, such as holding the chart. This relieves the pilot of a task.  

# Automation  

In the GA community, an automated aircraft is generally comprised of an integrated advanced avionics system consisting of a primary flight display (PFD), a multifunction flight display (MFD) including an instrument-certified global positioning system (GPS) with traffic and terrain graphics, and a fully integrated autopilot. This type of aircraft is commonly known as a technically advanced aircraft(TAA) In a TAA aircraft, there are typically two display (computer) screens: PFD (left display screen) and MFD.  

![](images/1df8c64a09764604a674345b5a07163722eb21a06d92ba85f33aa6359b7b7be3.jpg)  
Figure 2-2o.The pilot has a certain capacity of doing work and handling tasks.However, there is a point where the tasking exceeds the pilot'scapability.Whenthishappens,tasks are either not performed properly or some are not performed at all.  

Automation is the single most important advance in aviation technologies.Electronic flight displays(EFDs)havemade vast improvements in how information is displayed and what information is available to the pilot.Pilots can access electronic databases that contain all of the information traditionally contained in multiple handbooks, reducing clutter in the flight deck.[Figure2-21]  

MFDs are capable of displaying moving maps thatmirron sectional charts.These detailed displays depict all airspace, including Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). MFDs are so descriptive that many pilots fall into the trap of relying solely onthemovingmaps for navigation.Pilots alsodraw upon the database to familiarize themselves with departure and destination airport information.  

More pilots now rely on electronic databases for flight planning and use automated flight planning tools rather than planning the flight by the traditional methods of laying out charts,drawing the course,identifying navigation points(assuming a VFR flight),and using the POH to figureout theweight andbalance and performance charts. Whichever method a pilot chooses to plan a flight,it is  

![](images/450e5a5108f54f89ae89fedeb8c13d85126d8880cc893378e4c237ea54a0bc62.jpg)  
Figure2-21.Electronic flight instrumentation comes in many systems and provides a myriad of information to the pilot.  

important to remember to check and confirm calculations. Alwaysremember thatit isuptothepilot tomaintainbasic airman ship skills anduse those skills often tomaintain proficiency in all tasks.  

Although automation has made flying safer,automated systems can make some errors more evident and sometimes hide other errors or make them less evident.Thereare concernsabouttheeffectof automationonpilots.Inastudy publishedin1995,the British Airline Pilots Association officially voiced its concern that"Airline pilots increasingly lack“basic flying skills’as a result of reliance on automation."  

This reliance on automation translates into a lack of basic flying skills that may affect the pilot's ability to cope with an in-flight emergency, such as sudden mechanical failure. The worry that pilots are becoming too reliant on automated systems and are not being encouraged or trained to fly manually has grown with theincrease in thenumber of MFDflight decks.  

Asautomated flight decksbegan entering everyday line operations, instructors and check airmen grew concerned about some of the unanticipated side effects.Despite the promise of reducing human mistakes, the flight managers reportedthe automation actually created muchlarger errors attimes.In the terminal environment,theworkloadinan automated flight deck actually seemed higher than in the older analog flight decks. At other times, the automation seemed to lull the flight crews into complacency.Overtime,concern surfaced that the manual flying skills of the automated flight crews deteriorated due to over-reliance on computers.The flight crew managers said they worried that pilots would haveless“stick-and-rudder”proficiency whenthose skills were needed to manually resume direct control of the aircraft.  

A major study was conducted to evaluate the performance of two groups of pilots. The control group was composed of pilotswhoflew an older version of a common twin-jet airliner equipped with analog instrumentation and the experimental group was composed of pilotswhoflew the same aircraft, but newer models equipped with an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and a flight management system (FMS).Thepilotswere evaluatedin maintaining aircraft parameters, such as heading, altitude, airspeed, glideslope. and localize r deviations,as well as pilot control inputs.These were recorded during a variety of normal,abnormal,and emergency maneuvers during 4 hours of simulator sessions.  

# Results of the Study  

When pilots who had flown EF Is for several years were required to fly various maneuvers manually,the aircraft parameters and flight control inputs clearly showed some erosion of flying skills. During normal maneuvers, such as turns to headings without a flight director, the EFIS group exhibited somewhat greater deviations than the analog group. Mostofthetime,the deviations were within the practical test standards(PTS),but the pilots definitely did notkeeponthe localizer andglideslope as smoothly as the analoggroup.  

The differences in hand-flying skills between the two groups became more significant during abnormal maneuvers, such as accelerated descent profiles known as"slam-dunks."When given close crossing restrictions,the analog crews were more adept at the mental math and usually maneuvered the aircraft in a smoother manner to make the restriction.Ontheother hand, the EFIS crews tended to go "heads down" and tried to solve the crossing restriction on the FM S.[Figure2-22]  

Another situationused in the simulator experiment reflected real world changes in approach that are common and can be assigned on short notice. Once again, the analog crews transitioned more easily to the parallel runway's localizer. whereas the EF IS crews had a much more difficult time with the pilot going head down for a significant amount of time trying toprogram the new approach into theFMS.  

While a pilot's lack of familiaritywith theEFISis often an issue,the approach would have been made easier by disengaging the automated system and manually flying the approach. At the time of this study, the general guidelines in the industry were to let the automated system do as much of the flying as possible. That view has since changed and it is recommended that pilots use their best judgment when choosing which level of automation will most efficiently do the task considering the workload and situational awareness.  

Emergency maneuvers clearly broadened the difference in manual flying skills between the two groups. In general, the analog pilots tended to fly raw data,so when they were given an emergency, such as an engine failure, and were instructed tofly the maneuver without a flight director, they performed it expertly.By contrast, SOPfor EFIS operations atthe time was to use the flight director.When EFIS crews had their flight directors disabled, their eye scan again began a more erratic searching pattern and their manual flying subsequently suffered.  

Those who reviewed the data saw that the EF IS pilots who better managed the automation alsohad better flying skills. While the data did not reveal whether those skills preceded or followed automation,it did indicate that automation management needed to be improved.Recommended“best practices" and procedures have remedied some of the earlier problems with automation.  

Pilotsmust maintain their flight skills and ability tomaneuver aircraft manually within the standards set forth in the PTS.It is recommended that pilots of automated aircraft occasionally disengage the automation and manually fly the aircraft to maintainstick-and-rudder proficiency.Itisimperative that the pilots understand that theEFD adds to the overall quality of the flight experience, but it can also lead to catastrophe if not utilized properly.At no time is the moving map meant to substitute for a VFR sectional or low altitude en route chart.  

# EquipmentUse Autopilot Systems  

In a single-pilot environment, an autopilot system can greatly reduce workload.[Figure 2-23] As a result,the pilot isfree tofocushisorher attention on other flight deck duties.This canimprove situational awareness and reduce thepossibility ofaCFITaccident.While the addition of an autopilot may certainly be considered a risk control measure, the real challenge comes in determining theimpact of aninoperative unit.If the autopilot is known to be inoperative prior to departure, this may factor into the evaluation of other risks.  

For example,the pilot maybe planning for a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) approach down to minimums on a dark night into an unfamiliar airport. In such a case, the pilot may have been relying heavily on a functioning autopilot capable of flying a coupled approach. This would free the pilot to monitor aircraft performance. A malfunctioning autopilot could be the single factor that takes this from a medium to a serious risk. At this point, an alternative needs tobeconsidered.Ontheotherhand,if the autopilot were to fail at a critical (high workload) portion of this same flight, the pilot must be prepared to take action. Instead of simply being an inconvenience,this could quickly turn into an emergency if not properly handled.The best way to ensure a pilot is prepared for such an event is to carefully study the issue prior to departure and determine well in advance how an autopilot failure is to be handled.  

# Familiarity  

As previously discussed,pilot familiarity with allequipment is critical in optimizing both safety and efficiency. If a pilot is unfamiliar with any aircraft systems, this will add to workload and may contribute to a loss of situational awareness.This level of proficiency is critical and should be looked upon as a requirement, not unlike carrying an adequate supply of fuel. Asaresult,pilots should not lookup on unfamiliarity with the aircraft and its systems as a risk control measure,butinsteadas a hazard with high risk potential. Discipline is key to success.  

![](images/3a1d861261d411b487711882e8a6cc94ec24a20f3ea9dd90aaf58dad7432d31b.jpg)  
Figure2-22.Two similar flight decks equipped with the same information two different ways,analog and digital.What are they indicating? Chances are that the analog pilot will review the top display before the bottom display.Conversely,the digitally trained pilot will review the instrument panel on the bottom first.

Figure2-23.An example of an autopilot system  

# Respect for Onboard Systems  

Automation can assist the pilot in many ways,but a thorough understanding of the system(s) in use is essential to gaining the benefits it can offer. Understanding leads to respect, which is achieved through discipline and the mastery of the onboard systems.It is important to fly the aircraft using minimal information from the primary flight display (PFD). This includes turns,climbs,descents,and being abletofly approaches.  

# Reinforcement of Onboard Suites  

The use of an EFD may not seem intuitive,but competency becomes better with understanding and practice.Computer- based software andincremental training helpthepilot become comfortable with the onboard suites.Then the pilot needs to practice what was learned in order to gain experience. Reinforcement not only yields dividends in the use of automation,it also reduces workload significantly.  

# GettingBeyond RoteWorkmanship  

Thekey toworking effectivelywith automation isgetting beyond the sequential process of executing an action.If a pilot has to analyze what key to push next, or always uses thesame sequence ofkeystrokes when others are available, he or she may be trapped in a rote process. This mechanical processindicatesashallowunderstandingofthesystem. Again, the desire is to become competent and know what to do without having to think about, “what keystroke is next." Operating the systemwith competency and comprehension benefits a pilot when situations become more diverse and tasksincrease.  

# Understand thePlatform  

Contrary to popular belief, flight in aircraft equipped with different electronic management suites requires the same attention as aircraft equipped with analog instrumentation and a conventional suite of avionics.The pilot should review and understand the different ways in which EF Dare used in a particular aircraft.[Figure2-24]  

The following are two simple rules for use of an EFD:  

Be able tofly the aircraft to the standardsin thePTS. Although this may seem insignificant, knowing how to fly the aircraft to a standard makes a pilot's airmanship smoother and allows him or her more time to attend to the system instead of managing multiple tasks. Read and understand the installed electronic flight systems manuals to include the use of the autopilot and the other onboard electronic management tools  

# Managing Aircraft Automation  

Before any pilot can master aircraft automation,heorshe must first know how to fly the aircraft. Maneuvers training remains an important component of flight training because almost 40percent of all GA accidents take place in the  

![](images/f0cc62a17df26a24d9868e55345a91ae0b2a623145efd2e333ee7bce52756aa5.jpg)  
Figure 2-24.Examples of different platforms.Toptobottom are the Beechcraft Baron G 58,CirrusSR22,andCirrusEntega.  

landingphase,one realm of flight that still does notinvolve programming a computer to execute.Another 15 percent of all GA accidents occurs during takeoff and initial climb.  

An advanced avionics safety issue identifiedby theFAA concerns pilots who apparently develop an unwarranted over-reliance in their avionics and the aircraft, believing that the equipment will compensate for pilot shortcomings. Related to the over-reliance is the role of ADM,whichis probably the most significant factor in the GA accident record of high performance aircraft used for cross-country flight TheFAA advanced avionics aircraftsafety studyfound that poordecision-making seems to afflict new advanced avionics pilots at a rate higher than that of GA as a whole.Thereview of advanced avionics accidents cited in this study shows the majority are not caused by something directly related to the aircraft, but by the pilot's lack of experience and a chain of poor decisions. One consistent theme in many of the fatal accidents is continued VFR flight intoIMC  

Thus,pilot skills for normal and emergency operationshinge not only on mechanical manipulation of the stick and rudder, but also include the mental mastery of the EFD. Threekey flight management skills are needed tofly the advanced avionics safely:information, automation, and risk.  

# Information Management  

For the newly transitioning pilot, the PFD, MFD, and GPS/ VHF navigator screens seem to offer too much information presented in colorful menus and submenus. In fact, the pilot maybe drowning in information but unable to find a specific piece of information.It might be helpful to remember these systems are similar to computers that store some folders on a desktop and some within a hierarchy  

Thefirst critical information management skill for flying with advanced avionics is to understand the system at a conceptual level. Remembering how the system is organized helps the pilot manage the available information.Itisimportantto understanding that learning knob-and-dial procedures is not enough.Learningmore about how advanced avionics systems work leads to better memory for procedures and allows pilots to solve problems they have not seen before.  

There are alsolimits to understanding. It is generally impossible to understand all of the behaviors of a complex avionics system.Knowing to expect surprises and to continually learn new things is more effective than attempting tomemorize mechanical manipulation of theknobs.Simulation software and books on the specific system used are of great value.  

The second critical information management skill is stop look,and read.Pilots new to advanced avionics often become fixated on the knobs and try to memorize each and every sequence of button pushes,pulls,andturns.Afarbetter strategyfor accessing and managing theinformation available in advanced avionics computers is to stop, look, and read. Reading before pushing, pulling, or twisting can often save a pilot some trouble.  

Once behind the display screens on an advanced avionics aircraft, the pilot's goal is to meter, manage, and prioritize the information flow to accomplish specific tasks. Certificated flight instructors (CFIs), as well as pilots transitioning to advanced avionics, will find it helpful to corral the information flow. This is possible through such tactics as configuring the aspects of the PFD and MFD screens according to personal preferences.For example, most systems offer map orientation options that include

 "north up, “track up,“DTK" (desired track up), and

 "heading up." Another tactic is to decide, when possible, howmuch(orhowlittle)information to display.Pilotscan alsotailor the information displayed to suit theneedsof a specificflight.  

Information flow can also be managed for a specific operation. The pilot has the ability to prioritize information for a timely display of exactly the information needed for any given flight operation. Examples of managing information displayfor a specific operation include:  

Program map scale settings for en route versus terminal area operation. Utilize the terrain awareness page on the MFD for a night or IMC flight in or near the mountains. Use the nearest airports inset on the PFD at night or over inhospitable terrain. Program theweather datalinkset toshowechoes and META R status flags.  

# Enhanced Situational Awareness  

An advanced avionics aircraft offers increased safety with enhanced situational awareness.Although aircraft flight manuals (AFM) explicitly prohibit using the moving map, topography, terrain awareness, traffic, and weather datalink displays as the primary data source, these tools nonetheless givethe pilot unprecedented information for enhanced situational awareness. Without a well-planned information management strategy, these tools also make it easy for an unwary pilot to slide into the complacent role of passenger incommand  

Consider the pilot whose navigational information management strategy consists solely of following the magenta line on themoving map.He or she can easily fly into geographic or regulatory disaster, if the straight-line GPS course goes through high terrain or prohibited airspace, or if themovingmap display fails  

A good strategy for maintaining situational awareness information management should include practices thathelp ensure that awareness is enhanced,notdiminished,bytheuse ofautomation.Two basic procedures are to always double- check the system and verbal callouts.At a minimum,ensure the presentation makes sense.Was the correct destination fed into the navigation system?Callouts-evenfor single-pilot operations-are an excellent way to maintain situational awareness, aswell asmanage information.  

Other ways to maintain situational awareness include:  

Perform verification checkof all programming.Before departure, check all information programmed while on theground. Check the flight routing. Before departure, ensure all routing matches the planned flight route. Enter the planned route and legs, to include headings and leg length, on a paper log. Use this log to evaluate what has been programmed. If the two do not match, do not assume the computer data is correct, double check the computer entry. Verifywaypoints. Make use of all onboard navigation equipment. For example,useVOR to back up GPS and vice versa. Matchtheuseoftheautomatedsystemwithpilot proficiency. Stay within personal limitations. Plan a realistic flight route to maintain situational awareness.For example,although the onboard equipment allows a direct flight from Denver, Colorado,to Destin,Florida,the likelihood of rerouting around Eglin Air Force Base's airspace is high. Be ready to verify computer data entries.Forexample incorrect keystrokes could lead tolossof situational awareness because the pilot may not recognize errors made during a high workload period.  

# Automation Management  

Advanced avionics offer multiplelevels of automation,from strictly manual flight tohighly automated flight. No onelevel of automation is appropriate for all flight situations,butin order to avoid potentially dangerous distractions when flying with advanced avionics,the pilot must knowhow to manage the course deviation indicator(CDl),the navigation source, and the autopilot. It is important for a pilot to know the peculiarities of the particular automated system beingused. This ensures the pilot knows what to expect,how to monitor for proper operation, and promptly take appropriate action if thesystem doesnotperform as expected.  

For example, at the most basic level, managing the autopilot means knowing at all times which modes are engaged and which modes are armed to engage. The pilot needs to verify that armedfunctions(e.g.,navigation tracking or altitude capture) engage at the appropriate time.Automation management is another good place to practice the call out technique,especially after arming the system to make a changein courseor altitude.  

In advanced avionics aircraft,proper automation management also requires a thorough understanding of how the autopilot interacts with the other systems.Forexample,withsome autopilots,changing the navigation source on the e-HSI from GPS to LOC or VOR while the autopilot is engaged in NAV (course tracking mode) causes the autopilot's NAV mode to disengage.The autopilot's lateral controlwilldefaulttoROL (wing level) until the pilot takes action to reengage the NAV mode to track the desired navigation source.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management is the last of the three flight management skills needed for mastery of the glass flight deck aircraft.The enhanced situational awareness and automation capabilities offered by a glassflight deck airplanevastly expandits safety and utility, especially for personal transportation use. At the sametime,there is some risk that lighter workloads could lead to complacency.  

Humans are characteristically poor monitors of automated systems.When asked to passively monitor an automated system for faults, abnormalities, or other infrequent events, humans perform poorly.The more reliable the system,the poorer the human performance. For example, the pilot only monitors a backup alert system,rather than the situation that the alert system is designed tosafeguard. It is a paradox of automation that technically advanced avionics can both increase and decrease pilot awareness.  

It is important to remember that EF Ds do not replace basic flight knowledge and skills.They area tool for improving flightsafety.Riskincreases when the pilot believes the gadgets compensatefor lackof skill andknowledge.It isespecially important to recognize there are limits to what the electronic systems in any light GA aircraft can do. Being PIC requires sound ADM,which sometimes means saying"no"to a flight  

Risk is also increased when the pilot fails to monitor the systems.By failing to monitor the systems and failing to checktheresults oftheprocesses,thepilotbecomes detached from the aircraft operation and slides into the complacent role of passenger in command.Complacencyled totragedy in a 1999aircraft accident.  

In Colombia,amulti-engine aircraft crewed with two pilots struck the face of the Andes Mountains.Examinationof their FM S revealed theyentered awaypoint intotheFMS incorrectly by one degree resulting in a flight path taking themtoapoint  $60~\mathrm{{NM}}$  off their intended course.Thepilots were equippedwith theproper charts,their routewasposted on the charts, and they had a paper navigation log indicating the direction of each leg. They had all the tools to manage and monitor their flight,but instead allowed the automation tofly andmanageitself.Thesystemdidexactlywhatitwas programmed to do; it flew on a programmed course into a mountain resulting in multiple deaths.'The pilots simply failed to manage the system and inherently created their own hazard. Although this hazard was self-induced,whatisnotableis the risk the pilots created through their own inattention. By failing to evaluate each turn made at the direction of automation,the pilotsmaximized riskinstead of minimizing it.In this case,a totally avoidable accidentbecome a tragedy through simple pilot error and complacency.  

For the GA pilot transitioning to automated systems, it is helpful tonote that all human activity involving technical devices entails some element of risk.Knowledge,experience, and mission requirements tilt the odds in favor of safe and successful flights.The advanced avionics aircraft offers many new capabilities and simplifies the basic flying tasks. but only if the pilot is properly trained and all the equipment is working as advertised.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter focused on helping the pilot improve his or her ADM skills with the goal of mitigating the risk factors associated with flight in both classic and automated aircraft. In the end, the discussion is not so much about aircraft, but about the people who fly them  

# Chapter 3 Aircraft Construction  

# Introduction  

An aircraft is a device thatis used,orintended tobe used,for flightaccording to thecurrent Title14of theCodeof Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 1, Definitions and Abbreviations. Categories of aircraft for certification of airmen include airplane, rotorcraft, glider, lighter-than-air, powered-lift, powered parachute, and weight-shift control aircraft. Title 14 CFR part 1 also defines airplane as an engine-driven, fixed-wing aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of air against its wings. Another term, not yet codified in 14 CFR part 1,is advanced avionics aircraft, which refers to an aircraft that contains a global positioning system (GPS) navigation system with a moving map display, in conjunction with another system,such as an autopilot. This chapter provides a brief introduction to the structure of aircraft and uses an airplanefor most illustrations.Light Sport Aircraft (LSA), such as weight-shift control aircraft, balloon, glider, powered parachute, and gyroplane, have their own handbooks to include detailed information regarding aerodynamicsandcontrol.

# Aircraft Design, Certification, and Airworthiness  

The FAA certifies three types of aviation products: aircraft, aircraftengines,andpropellers.Each of these products hasbeendesigned to a set of airworthiness standards. These standards are parts of Title14of theCodeof Federal Regulations (14 CFR), published by the FAA. The air worthiness standards were developed to help ensure that aviation products are designed with no unsafe features. Different airworthiness standards apply to the different categories of aviation products asfollows:  

Normal,Utility,Acrobatic,and Commuter Category Airplanes- 14 CFR part 23 Transport Category Airplanes—14 CFR part 25 Normal Category—14 CFR part 27 Transport Category Rotorcraft—14 CFR part 29 Manned Free Balloons—14 CFR part 31 Aircraft Engines—14 CFR part 33 Propellers—14 CFR part 35  

Some aircraft areconsidered“specialclasses"of aircraft and donothavetheirownairworthinessstandards,suchasgliders andpoweredlift.The air worthiness standards used for these aircraft area combination of requirements in 14 CFR parts 23,25,27,and 29 that the FAA and the designer have agreed are appropriate for the proposed aircraft.  

The FAA issues a Type Certificate(TC)for the product when they are satisfied it complies with the applicable air worthiness standards.When the TC is issued,aType Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS)is generated that specifies the important design and operational characteristics of the aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller.TheTCDS defines the product andare available to the public from theFAAwebsite atwww.faa.gov.  

# A Note About Light Sport Aircraft  

Light sport aircraft are not designed according toFAA airworthiness standards. Instead, they are designed to a consensus of standards agreed upon in the aviation industry. TheFAA has agreed theconsensus ofstandardsis acceptable as the design criteria for these aircraft. Light sport aircraft do not necessarily have individually type certificated engines andpropellers.Instead,aTC is issued to the aircraft as a whole. It includes the airframe, engine, and propeller.  

Aircraft, aircraft engines, and propellers can be manufactured one at a time from the design drawings, or through an FAA approved manufacturing process, depending on the size and capabilities of the manufacturer. During the manufacturing process, each part is inspected to ensure that it has been built exactly according to the approved design. This inspection is called a conformity inspection.  

When the aircraftis complete, with the airframe,engine,and propeller,itis inspected and theFAAissues an airworthiness certificate for the aircraft.Having an air worthiness certificate means the complete aircraft meets the design and manufacturing standards,andisina condition for safe flight Thisairworthinesscertificatemustbecarriedintheaircraft during all flight operations. The airworthiness certificate remainsvalid as long as the required maintenance and inspections are kept up to date for the aircraft.  

Air worthiness certificates are classified as either"Standard' or"Special."Standardairworthinesscertificatesarewhite, and are issued for normal,utility,acrobatic,commuter,or transport category aircraft. They are also issued for manned free balloons and aircraft designated as“Special Class."  

Special air worthiness certificates are pink,andareissued for primary, restricted, and limited category aircraft, and light sport aircraft. They are also issued as provisional air worthiness certificates,special flight permits(ferry permits),and forexperimental aircraft.  

Moreinformation on airworthiness certificates canbefound in Chapter 9,in14 CFRparts 175-225,and also on the FAA websiteatwww.faa.gov.  

# Lift and Basic Aerodynamics  

In order to understand the operation of the major components and sub components of an aircraft,itisimportantto understand basic aerodynamic concepts.This chapter briefly introduces aerodynamics; a more detailed explanation can be found in Chapter 5, Aerodynamics of Flight.  

Four forces act upon an aircraft in relation to straight-and- level,unaccelerated flight. These forces are thrust, lift, weight, and drag. [Figure 3-1]  

Thrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis. Thisisnot alwaysthecase asexplainedlater.  

Dragis a rearward,retarding force and is caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other protruding objects Dragopposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative Wind.

Figure 3-1.The four forces.  

Weightis thecombinedload of the aircraft itself,the crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls the aircraft downward because of theforce ofgravity.It opposeslift and acts vertically downward throughthe aircraft'scenter ofgravity (CG).  

Lift opposes the downward force of weight,isproduced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the wing, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the wing's center of lift (CL).  

An aircraft moves in three dimensions and is controlled by moving it about one or more of its axes. The longitudinal, or roll,axis extends through the aircraft from nose totail, with the line passing through the CG. The lateral or pitch axis extends across the aircraft on a line through the wing tips, again passing through the CG. The vertical, or yaw, axis passes through the aircraft vertically, intersecting the CG. All control movements cause the aircraft tomove around one or more of these axes and allows for the control of the aircraft inflight.[Figure3-2]  

One of the most significant components of aircraft design is CG. It is the specific point where the mass or weight of an aircraft may be said to center; that is, a point around which, if the aircraft could be suspended or balanced, the aircraft would remain relatively level.The position of the CG of an aircraft determines the stability of the aircraft in flight As the CG moves rearward (towards the tail), the aircraft becomes more and more dynamically unstable. In aircraft with fuel tanks situated in front of the CG, it is important that the CGis set with the fuel tank empty.Otherwise, as the fuel is used, the aircraft becomes unstable. [Figure 3-3] The CG is computed during initial design and construction and is further affected by the installation of onboard equipment, aircraftloading,and otherfactors.  

# Major Components  

Although airplanes are designed for a variety ofpurposes,most of them have the same major components. [Figure 3-4] The overall characteristics arelargely determined by the original design objectives. Most airplane structures include a fuselage, wings, an empennage, landing gear, and a powerplant.  

# Fuselage  

Thefuselageis thecentral body of an airplane andis designed to accommodate the crew, passengers, and cargo. It also provides the structural connection for the wings and tail assembly. Older types of aircraft design utilized an open truss structure constructed of wood, steel, or aluminum tubing. [Figure3-5] The most popular types of fuselage structures used in today's aircraft are the monocoque (French for “single shell")and semimonocoque.These structure types are discussed in more detail under aircraft construction later in thechapter.  

# Wings  

The wings are airfoils attached to each side of thefuselage and are the main lifting surfaces that support the airplane in

f the CG is too far aft, there might not be enough elevator nose-dowr force at the low stall airspeed to get the nose down for recovery.

flight. There are numerous wing designs, sizes, and shapes used by the various manufacturers.Eachfulfills a certain need with respect tothe expected performancefor the particular airplane. How the wing produces lift is explained in Chapter 5,Aerodynamics of Flight.  

Wings maybe attached at the top,middle,orlowerportion of the fuselage. These designs are referred to as high-,mid- and low-wing, respectively. The number of wings can also vary.Airplanes with a single set of wings arereferredtoas monoplanes,while those with two sets are called biplanes. [Figure3-6]  

Many high-wing airplanes have external braces, or wing struts that transmit the flight and landing loads through the struts to the main fuselage structure. Since the wing struts are usually attached approximately halfway out on thewing this type of wing structure is called semi-cantilever.Afew high-wing and most low-wing airplanes have a full cantilever wing designed to carry the loads without external struts.  

The principal structural parts of the wing are spars, ribs and stringers. [Figure 3-7] These are reinforced by trusses, I-beams, tubing, or other devices, including the skin. The wing ribs determine the shape and thickness of the wing (airfoil). In most modern airplanes, the fuel tanks are either an integral part of the wing's structure or consist of flexible containers mounted inside of thewing  

![](images/8bf88a7b203ddd1277cf306e59fe9e8d6cf2ac9c2186a92172633f4ab457a297.jpg)  
Figure3-6.Monoplane(left)and biplane(right)  

Attached to the rear, or trailing edges, of the wings are two types of control surfaces referred to as ailerons and flaps. Ailerons extend from about the midpoint of each wing outward toward the tip, and move in opposite directions to create aerodynamic forces that cause the airplane to roll. Flaps extend outwardfrom the fuselage to near the midpoint of each wing. The flaps are normally flush with the wing's surface during cruising flight.Whenextended,theflapsmove simultaneously downward toincrease the lifting force of the wing for takeoffs and landings.[Figure3-8]  

# AlternateTypes ofWings  

Alternatetypes of wingsare oftenfound on aircraft.The shape and design of a wing is dependent upon the type of operation for which an aircraft is intended and is tailored tospecific types of flying.These design variations are discussed in Chapter 5,Aerodynamics of Flight,which provides information on the effect controls have on lifting surfaces from traditional wings to wings that use both flexing (duetobillowing)andshifting(through the change of the aircraft's CG). For example, the wing of the weight-shift control aircraft ishighlyswept in an effort to reduce drag and allowfor the shifting of weight to provide controlled flight.[Figure3-9]Handbooks specific to most categories of aircraft are availablefor the interested pilot and canbe found on theFederal Aviation Administration(FAA)website atwww.faa.gov.

# Empennage  

The em penn age includes the entire tailgroupand consists of fixed surfaces,such as the vertical stabilizer and the horizontal stabilizer.The movable surfaces include the rudder, the elevator, and one or more trim tabs. [Figure 3-10]  

The rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabilizer. During flight,it is used to move the airplane's nose left andright.Theelevator,whichisattached tothebackof the horizontalstabilizer,isusedtomovethenoseoftheairplane up anddown during flight.Trim tabs are small,movable  

![](images/34d38cd2089b5a03a30efbb78bfef518ac2e9d02f06de3b9bb45b26f16669af1.jpg)  
Figure3-9.Weight-shift control aircraft use the shifting of weigh i forcontrol.  

portions of the trailing edge of the control surface. These movable trim tabs, which are controlled from the flight deck. reduce control pressures. Trim tabs may be installed on the ailerons,therudder,and/ortheelevator.  

A second type of empennage design does not require an elevator. Instead, it incorporates a one-piece horizontal stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point. This type of design is called a stabilator and is moved using the control wheel, just as the elevator is moved. For example, when a pilot pulls back on the control wheel, the stabilator pivots so the trailing edge moves up. This increases the aerodynamic tail load and causes the nose of the airplane tomove up Stab ila tors have an anti servo tab extending across the in trailingedge.[Figure3-11]  

The antiservo tab moves in the same direction as the trailing edgeof thestabilator and helps make the stab il at or less sensitive. The antiservo tab also functions as a trim tab to relievecontrol pressures and helpsmaintain thestabilator in the desired position.

Figure 3-11.Stabilator components.  

# Landing Gear  

The landing gear is the principal support of the airplane when parked, taxiing, taking off, or landing. The most common type oflandinggear consists of wheels,but airplanes can also be equipped with floats for water operations or skis for landing onsnow.[Figure3-12]  

Wheeled landing gear consists of threewheels-twomain wheels and a third wheel positioned either at thefront or rear of the airplane. Landing gear with a rear mounted wheel is called conventional landing gear.  

Airplaneswith conventional landing gear are sometimes referred to as tailwheel airplanes. When the third wheel is located on the nose,itiscalled anosewheel,andthedesign is referred to as a tricycle gear.A steerable nose wheel or tail wheel permits the airplane to be controlled throughout all operations while on the ground.Most aircraft are steered by moving the rudder pedals,whether nose wheel or tail wheel. Additionally, some aircraft are steered by differential braking  

# ThePowerplant  

The powerplant usually includes both the engine and the propeller. The primary function of the engine is to provide the power to turn the propeller. It also generates electrical power,provides a vacuum source for some flight instruments, and in most single-engine airplanes, provides a source of heat for the pilot and passengers. [Figure 3-13] The engine is covered by a cowling, or a nacelle, which are both types of covered housing. The purpose of the cowling or nacelle is to streamline the flow of air around the engine and to help cool theengineby ducting air around thecylinders.  

The propeller, mounted on the front of the engine, translates the rotating force of the engine into thrust, a forward acting force that helps move the airplane through the air. A propeller  

![](images/63face6a9435a6922cc45b282c29a33a85426c4c816a457c35457b4b53bcd9a1.jpg)  
Figure 3-12.Types oflanding gear: floats (top), skis(middle),and wheels(bottom).  

is a rotating airfoil that produces thrust through aerodynamic action. A high-pressure area is formed at the back of the propeller's airfoil, and low pressure is produced at the face of the propeller, similar to the way liftis generated by an airfoil used as a lifting surface or wing. This pressure differential develops thrust from the propeller, which in turn pulls the airplane forward. Engines may be turned around tobe pushers with the propeller at therear.  

There are two significant factors involved in the design of a propeller that impact its effectiveness. The angle of a  

![](images/1ac46736be972440fa49518e7ada419263aae225a94d90aa346326ff0cc4e43c.jpg)  
Figure3-13.Engine compartment.  

propellerblade, as measured against the hub of the propeller, keeps the angle of attack(AOA) (See definition in Glossary) relatively constant along the span of the propeller blade, reducing or eliminating the possibility of as tall.Theamount of lift being produced by the propeller is directly related to the AOA,which is the angle atwhich the relative wind meets the blade.The AOA continuously changes during the flight depending upon the direction of the aircraft.  

The pitch is defined as the distance a propeller would travel in one revolution if it were turning in a solid.Thesetwofactors combine to allow a measurement of thepropeller's efficiency. Propellers are usually matched to a specific aircraft/ powerplant combination to achieve the best efficiency at a particular power setting, and they pull or push depending on how the engine is mounted.  

# Subcomponents  

The sub components of an airplane include the airframe. electrical system,flight controls,andbrakes.  

Theairframe is the basic structure of anaircraft and is designed towithstand all aerodynamic forces,aswell as the stresses imposed by the weight of the fuel, crew, and payload.  

The primary function of an aircraft electrical system is to generate,regulate,and distribute electrical power throughout theaircraft.Thereareseveraldifferentpowersourceson aircraft to power the aircraft electrical systems.These power sourcesinclude:engine-driven alternating current (AC) generators, auxiliary power units (APUs), and external power.Theaircraft's electrical power system is used to operate the flight instruments, essential systems, such as anti-icing, and passenger services, such as cabin lighting.  

The flight controls are the devices and systems that govern the attitude of an aircraft and, as a result, the flight path followed by the aircraft.In the case of many conventional airplanes, the primary flight controls utilize hinged, trailing- edge surfaces called elevators for pitch, ailerons for roll, and therudderforyaw.Thesesurfacesareoperatedbythepilot in the flight deck or by an automatic pilot.  

In the case of most modern airplanes, airplane brakes consist ofmultiplepads(called caliper pads)that are hydraulically squeezed toward each other with a rotating disk(called a rotor)betweenthem.The pads place pressure on therotor which is turning with the wheels.As a result of the increased friction on the rotor, the wheels inherently slow down and stop turning. The disks and brake pads are made either from steel,likethoseinacar,orfrom acarbonmaterial thatweighs less and can absorb more energy.Because airplane brakes are used principally during landings and must absorbenormous amounts of energy, their life is measured in landings rather than miles.  

# Types of Aircraft Construction  

The construction of aircraft fuselages evolved from the early wood truss structural arrangements to monocoque shell structures to the current semimonocoque shell structures.  

# TrussStructure  

The main drawback of truss structure is its lack of a streamlined shape.In this construction method,lengths of tubing,calledlongerons,are welded in place to form a well- bracedframework.Vertical and horizontal struts are welded to the longerons and give the structure a square or rectangular shape whenviewedfrom the end.Additional struts areneeded to resist stress that can come from anydirection.Stringers and bulkheads, or formers, are added to shape the fuselage and support the covering  

As technology progressed, aircraft designers began to enclose the truss members tostreamline the airplane and improve performance. This was originally accomplished with cloth fabric, which eventually gave way to lightweight metals such as aluminum.In some cases, the outside skin can support all or a major portion of the flight loads. Most modern aircraft use a form of this stressed skin structure known as monocoque or semi monocoque construction.[Figure3-14]  

# Monocoque  

Monocoque construction uses stressed skin to support almost all loads much like an aluminum beverage can.Although very strong,monocoque construction is not highly tolerant  

![](images/11a10bc318af381c1c3fc801087bda1204e51c1592742cd29f93d579f4790808.jpg)  
Figure3-14.Semimonocoqueandmonocoquefuselagedesign  

todeformation of the surface.For example,an aluminum beverage can supports considerable forces at the ends of the can, but if the side of the can is deformed slightly while supporting aload,it collapseseasily.  

Because most twisting and bending stresses are carried by the external skin rather than by an open framework, the need for internal bracing was eliminated or reduced,savingweight and maximizing space.One of the notable and innovative methods for using monocoque construction was employed by Jack Northrop.In 1918,he devised a newway to construct a monocoque fuselage used for the Lockheed S-1 Racer. The technique utilized two molded plywood half-shellsthat were glued together around wooden hoops or stringers. To construct the half shells, rather than gluing many strips of plywood over a form, three large sets of spruce strips were soaked with glue and laid in a semi-circular concrete mold that looked like a bathtub. Then, under a tightly clamped lid,arubberballoonwasinflatedinthecavitytopress the plywood against the mold. Twenty-four hours later, thesmooth half-shell was ready tobe joined to another to create the fuselage. The two halves were each less than a quarter inch thick. Although employed in the early aviation period, monocoque construction would not reemerge for several decades due to the complexities involved.Every day examples of monocoque construction can be found in automobile manufacturing where the unibodyis considered standard inmanufacturing.  

# Semimonocoque  

Semimonocoque construction, partial or one-half, uses a substructure towhich the airplane's skin is attached. The substructure,which consists of bulkheads and/orformers ofvarious sizes and stringers,reinforces the stressed skin by taking some of the bending stress from the fuselage. The main section of thefuselage alsoincludes wing attachment points and a firewall. On single-engine airplanes, the engine is usually attached to the front of the fuselage. There is a fireproof partition between the rear of the engine and the flightdeckor cabin to protect the pilot and passengers from accidental engine fires. This partition is called a firewall and is usually made of heat-resistant material such asstainless steel. However, a new emerging process of construction is the integration of composites or aircraft made entirely of composites.  

# Composite Construction History  

The use of composites in aircraft construction can be dated toWorldWarIIaircraftwhensoftfiberglassinsulationwas used in B-29 fuselages. By the late 1950s, European high performance sail plane manufacturers were using fiberglass as primary structures. In 1965, the FAA type certified the first all-fiberglass aircraft in the normal category, a Swiss sailplane called a Diamant HBV.Four yearslater,the FAA certified a four-seat, single-engine Windecker Eagle in the normalcategory.By2005,over 35 percent of new aircraft wereconstructed of composite materials.  

Compositeis abroadterm and can mean materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber cloth, KevlarTM cloth, and mixtures of allof theabove.Composite construction offers two advantages:extremely smooth skins and the ability to easily form complex curved or streamlined structures.[Figure3-15]  

# Composite Materials in Aircraft  

Composite materials are fiber-reinforced matrix systems. The matrix is the“glue"used tohold the fibers together and, when cured, gives the part its shape, but the fibers carry most of the load. There are many different types of fibers and matrix systems.  

In aircraft, the most common matrix is epoxy resin, which is a type of thermosetting plastic.Compared to other choices such as polyester resin, epoxy is stronger and has good high- temperature properties.There aremany different types of epoxies available with a wide range of structural properties, cure times and temperatures,andcosts.  

![](images/253343993b1efefc094bf884239bfa2c1fa2a1ac740f9cf9ba32ea09321df3ed.jpg)  
Figure3-15.Composite aircraft  

The most common reinforcing fibers used in aircraft construction are fiberglass and carbon fiber.Fiberglass has good tensile and compressive strength,good impact resistance, is easy to work with, and is relatively inexpensive and readily available.Its main disadvantage is that it is somewhatheavy,and it is difficult to make a fiberglass load- carrying structure lighter than a well designed equivalent aluminum structure.  

Carbon fiber is generally stronger in tensile andcompressive strength than fiberglass and has much higher bending stiffness.It is also considerably lighter thanfiberglass. However, it is relatively poor in impact resistance; the fibers are brittle and tend to shatter under sharp impact. This can be greatly improved with a "toughened"epoxy resin system, as used in the Boeing 787horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Carbonfiberis more expensive than fiberglass, but the price has dropped due to innovations driven by the B-2 program in the 1980s and Boeing 777 work in the 1990s. Very well- designed carbonfiber structures canbe significantly lighter than an equivalent aluminum structure, sometimes by 30 percentorso.  

# Advantages of Composites  

Composite construction offers several advantages over metal,wood,or fabric, withits lighter weight being the most frequently cited.Lighter weight is not always automatic. It must be remembered that building an aircraft structure out of composites does not guarantee it will be lighter; it depends on the structure, as well as the type of composite being used.  

A more important advantage is that a very smooth, compound curved,aerodynamic structure made from composites reducesdrag.This is the main reason sail plane designers switched from metal and wood to composites in the 1960s. In aircraft, the use of composites reduces drag for the Cirrus and Columbia line of production aircraft,leading to their high performance despite their fixed landing gear.Composites also help mask the radar signature of “stealth" aircraft designs, such as the B-2 and the F-22. Today, composites can be found in aircraft as varied as gliders to most new helicopters.  

Lack of corrosion is a third advantage of composites. Boeing is designing the 787, with its all-composite fuselage, tohave both a higher pressure differential and higher humidity in the cabin than previous airliners. Engineers are no longer as concerned about corrosion from moisture condensation on the hidden areas of the fuselage skins, such as behind insulation blankets.This should lead to lower long-termmaintenance costs for the airlines.  

Another advantage of composites is their good performance in a flexing environment, such as in helicopter rotor blades. Composites do not suffer from metal fatigue and crack growth as do metals.While it takes careful engineering,composite rotor blades canhave considerably higher designlives than metalblades,and most new large helicopter designs have all compositeblades,andin many cases,compositerotor hubs.  

# Disadvantages of Composites  

Composite construction comes with its own set of disadvantages,the most important of which is the lack of visual proof of damage.Composites respond differently from other structural materials to impact,and there is often no obvious sign of damage. For example, if a car backs into an aluminum fuselage,it might dent the fuselage. If the fuselage isnotdented,thereisnodamage.If the fuselage is dented the damageisvisible andrepairs aremade  

In a composite structure, a low energy impact, such as a bump or a tool drop, may not leave any visible sign of the impact onthesurface.Underneath the impact site there may be extensive delaminations, spreading in a cone-shaped area from the impact location. The damage on the backside of thestructure can be significant andextensive,butit maybe hiddenfrom view.Anytime one has reason to think there may have been an impact,even a minor one,it isbest to get aninspector familiar with composites to examine the structure to determine underlying damage.Theappearance of “whitish" areas in a fiberglass structure is a good tip-off that de lamination s of fiber fracture has occurred.  

A medium energy impact (perhaps the car backing into the structure)results in local crushing of the surface,which shouldbevisible totheeye.Thedamaged area islarger than the visible crushed area andwill need to be repaired.Ahigh energy impact, such as a bird strike or hail while in flight results in a puncture and a severely damaged structure. In medium and high energy impacts,the damage is visible to the eye,but low energy impact is difficult to detect.[Figure3-16]  

If an impact results in delaminations, crushing of the surface or a puncture, then a repair is mandatory. While waiting for the repair, the damaged area should be covered and protected from rain. Many composite parts are composed of thin skins over a honeycomb core, creating a"sandwich" structure. While excellent for structural stiffness reasons, such a structure is an easy target for water ingress (entering), leading to further problems later. A piece of “speed tape' over the puncture is a good way to protect it from water, but it isnot astructural repair.Theuseof apastefiller tocover up the damage,while acceptablefor cosmetic purposes,is not a structural repair, either.  

![](images/248df6453095f4a626ac3bf2a4a3b8315ff35ba6851e4e36929c2761ba82c769.jpg)  
Figure3-16.Impact energy affects the visibility,aswellasthe severity,of damage in composite structures.Highandmedium energyimpacts,whilesevere,areeasytodetect.Low energy impacts can easily cause hidden damage.  

The potential for heat damage to the resin is another disadvantage of using composites. While "too hot”depends on the particular resin system chosen,many epoxies begin toweakenover  $150\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  White paint on composites is often usedtominimizethisissue.Forexample,thebottom of a wing that is painted black facing a black asphalt ramp onahot,sunny day can get a shot as  $220\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  Thesame structure,paintedwhite,rarelyexceeds  $140~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Asaresult, composite aircraft oftenhave specific recommendations on allowable paint colors.If the aircraft is repainted,these recommendations must be followed.Heat damage can also occur due to a fire. Even a quickly extinguished small brake fire can damage bottom wing skins, composite landing gear legs, or wheel pants.  

Also,chemical paint strippers arevery harmful to composites and must not be used on them.If paint needs to be removed from composites,only mechanical methods are allowed, such as gentle grit blasting or sanding. Many expensive composite parts have been ruined by the use of paint stripper and such damage is generally not repairable.  

# FluidS pills on Composites  

Some owners are concerned about fuel, oil, or hydraulic fluid spills on composite surfaces. These are generally not a problem with modern composites using epoxy resin. Usually, if the spill does not attack the paint, it will not hurt the underlying composite.Some aircraft use fiberglass fuel tanks,forexample in which thefuel rides directly against the composite surface with no sealant being used. If the fiberglass structure is made with some of the more inexpensive types of polyester resin, there can be a problem when using auto gas with ethanol blended into the mixture. The more expensive types of polyesterresin,aswellasepoxyresin,canbeusedwithauto gas, as well as 1o0 octane aviation gas (avgas) and jet fuel.  

# Lightning Strike Protection  

Lightning strike protection is an important consideration in aircraft design. When an aircraft is hit by lightning, a very large amount of energy is delivered to the structure.Whether flying a light general aviation (GA) aircraft or alarge airliner, the basic principle of lightning strike protection is the same. For anysize aircraft,theenergyfromthestrikemustbespread over a large surface area to lower the amps per square inch to a harmless level.  

If lightning strikes an aluminum airplane, the electrical energynaturally conducts easily through the aluminum structure. The challenge is to keep the energy out of avionics, fuel systems, etc., untilit can be safely conducted overboard. Theouterskinof the aircraftis the path of least resistance.  

In a composite aircraft, fiberglass is an excellent electrical insulator,while carbonfiber conducts electricity,butnot as easily as aluminum.Therefore,additional electrical conductivity needs to be added to theoutsidelayer of composite skin. This is done typically with fine metal meshes bonded to the skin surfaces. Aluminum and copper mesh are the two most common types, with aluminum used on fiberglass and copper on carbon fiber.Any structural repairs onlightning-strike protected areas must also include the mesh as well as the underlying structure.  

For composite aircraft with internal radio antennas,there mustbe“windows"in thelightning strike meshin the area of the antenna.Internal radio antennas may be found in fiberglass composites because fiberglass is transparent to radio frequencies,where carbon fiber is not.  

# TheFuture of Composites  

In the decades since WorldWar I,composites have earned an important role in aircraft structure design. Their design flexibility and corrosion resistance, as well as the high strength-to-weight ratios possible,will undoubtedly continue to lead to more innovative aircraft designs in the future. FromtheCirrusSR-20 to the Boeing 787,itisobviousthat composites have found a home in aircraft construction and areheretostay.[Figure3-l7]  

# Instrumentation: Moving into the Future  

Untilrecently，most GA aircraft were equippedwith individual instruments utilized collectively to safely operate and maneuver the aircraft.With the release of the electronic flight display (EFD) system, conventional instruments have been replaced by multiple liquid crystal display (LCD) screens. The first screen is installed in front of the pilot position and is referred to as the primary flight display (PFD). The second screen, positioned approximately in the center of the instrument panel, is referred to as the multi-function display(MFD).Thesetwoscreensde-clutterinstrumentpanels whileincreasing safety.Thishasbeen accomplished through the utilization of solid state instruments that have a failurerate farless than those of conventional analog instrumentation.[Figure3-18]  

With today's improvements in avionics and the introduction ofEFDs,pilots at any level of experience need an astute knowledge of the onboard flight control systems,aswellas an understanding of how automation melds with aeronautical decision-making (ADM). These subjects are covered in detail in Chapter 2,Aeronautical Decision-Making.  

Whether an aircraft has analog or digital (glass)instruments the instrumentation falls into three different categories performance, control, and navigation.

# Performance Instruments  

The performance instruments indicate the aircraft's actual performance.Performance is determined by reference to the altimeter, airspeed or vertical speed indicator (VsI), heading indicator, and turn-and-slip indicator. The performance instruments directly reflect the performance the aircraft is achieving.The speed of the aircraft canbereferenced on the airspeed indicator.The altitude can be referenced on the altimeter. The aircraft's climb performance can be determined by referencing the VsI.Other performance instruments available are the heading indicator,angleof attack indicator, and the slip-skid indicator.

# Control Instruments  

The control instruments display immediate attitude and power changes and are calibrated to permit adjustments in precise increments.[Figure3-20]The instrument for attitude display is the attitude indicator.The control instruments do not indicate aircraft speed or altitude.In order to determine these variables and others,a pilot must reference the performance instruments.  

selected navigation facility orfix.They also provide pilotage information so the aircraft can be maneuvered to keep it on a predetermined path.The pilotage information can be in either two or three dimensions relative to the ground-based or space-based navigation information.[Figures3-21and3-22]  

# Global Positioning System (GPS)  

GPSisasatellite-based navigation system composed of a network of satellites placed into orbit by the United States Departmentof Defense (DOD).GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s the government made the system available for civilian use.GPSworksin allweatherconditions,anywhereintheworld,24hours a day. A GPS receiver must be locked onto the signal of at least three satellites to calculate a two-dimensional position (latitude and longitude) and track movement. With four or more satellites in view,the receiver can determine the user's three-dimensional position (latitude, longitude, and altitude). Other satellites must alsobe in view to offset signal loss and signal ambiguity. The use of the GPS is discussed in more detail in Chapter 17, Navigation. Additionally, GPS is discussed in theAeronautical Information Manual(AIM).  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provides an overview of aircraft structures. Amorein-depthunderstandingof aircraftstructuresand controls can be gained through the use of flight simulation software or interactive programs available online through aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA).Pilots are also encouraged tosubscribe toor review the various aviation periodicals that contain valuable flying information. As discussed in Chapter 1, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA)and theFAA also offer free information for pilots.

# Chapter Principles o Flight  

# Introduction  

This chapter examines the fundamental physical laws governing the forces acting on an aircraft in flight, and what effect these natural laws and forces have onthe performance characteristics of aircraft. To control an aircraft be it an airplane, helicopter, glider, or balloon, the pilot must understand the principles involved and learn to use or counteract these natural forces.  

# Structure of the Atmosphere  

The atmosphereis an envelope of air that surrounds theEarth and rests upon its surface.It is as much a part of the Earth as these as or the land,but air differs from land andwaterasitis a mixture of gases. It has mass, weight, and indefinite shape.  

The atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as argon or helium. Some of these elements are heavier than others. The heavier elements, such as oxygen, settle to the surface of the Earth, while the lighter elements are lifted up to the region of higher altitude. Most of the atmosphere's oxygen iscontainedbelow35,000feetaltitude.  

# Air is a Fluid  

When most people hear the word “fluid," they usually think of liquid. However, gasses, like air, are also fluids. Fluids take on the shape of their containers.Fluids generally do not resist deformation when even the smalleststress is applied, or they resist it only slightly. We call this slight resistance viscosity.Fluids alsohave the ability to flow. Just as a liquid flows and fills a container, air will expand tofill the available volume ofits container. Both liquids and gasses display these unique fluid properties, even though they differ greatly in density.Understanding the fluid properties of air is essential tounderstanding the principles of flight  

# Viscosity  

Viscosity is the property of a fluid that causes it to resist flowing. The way individual molecules of the fluid tend to adhere, or stick, to each other determines how much a fluid resists flow.High-viscosity fluids are“thick”and resist flow; low-viscosity fluids are“thin"and floweasily.Airhas a low viscosity and flows easily  

Using two liquids as an example, similar amounts of oil and water poured down twoidentical rampswill flow atdifferent rates due to their different viscosity.The water seems to flow freely while the oil flows much more slowly.  

As another example, different types of similar liquids will display different behaviors because of different vis cosi ties. Grease isveryviscous.Giventime,grease will flow,even though the flow rate will be slow.Motor oil is less viscous thangrease and flows much more easily,butit is moreviscous and flows more slowly than gasoline.  

the viscosity of air.However, since air is a fluid and has viscosity properties,it resists flowaround anyobject td someextent.  

# Friction  

Another factor at work when a fluid flows over or around an object is called friction.Friction is theresistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another. Friction exists between any two materials that contact each Other.  

The effects of friction can be demonstrated using a similar example as before. If identical fluids are poured down two identicalramps,they flow in the same manner and at the same speed. If the surface of one ramp is rough, and the other smooth, the flow down the two ramps differs significantly. The rough surface ramp impedes the flow of the fluid due to resistance from the surface(friction).It is important to remember that all surfaces,no matter how smooth they appear, are not smooth on a microscopic level and impede theflowofafluid.  

Thesurface of awing,like anyother surface,hasacertain roughness at the microscopic level.The surface roughness causes resistance and slows the velocity of the air flowing overthewing.[Figure4-1]  

Moleculesof airpass over thesurface of thewing and actually adhere (stick, or cling) to the surface because of friction. Air molecules near the surface of the wing resist motion andhave a relative velocity near zero.Theroughnessof thesurface impedes their motion. The layer of molecules that adhere to the wing surface is referred to as the boundary layer.  

All fluids are viscous and have a resistance toflow,whether ornotweobservethisresistance.Wecannoteasilyobserve

Figure 4-1.Microscopic surface of a wing.  

Once the boundary layer of the air adheres to thewingby friction,further resistance to the air flow is caused by the viscosity,the tendency of the air to stick to itself.When these twoforces acttogether toresist airflow over awing itiscalleddrag.  

# Pressure  

Pressure is the force applied in a perpendicular direction to the surface of an object. Often, pressure is measured in pounds of force exerted per square inch of an object, or PSI. An object completely immersed in a fluid will feel pressure uniformly around the entire surface of the object.If the pressure on one surface of the objectbecomes less than the pressure exerted on the other surfaces,the object will move in the direction of the lower pressure.  

# AtmosphericPressure  

Although there are various kinds of pressure,pilots are mainly concerned with atmospheric pressure.Itisoneof the basic factors in weather changes,helps tolift an aircraft, and actuates some of the important flight instruments. These instruments arethealtimeter,airspeed indicator,vertical speedindicator,and manifold pressure gauge.  

Airisverylight,butithasmassandisaffectedbythe attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other substance, it has weight, and because of its weight, it has force. Since air is a fluid substance,this force is exerted equally in all directions.Its effect onbodies within the airis called pressure. Under standard conditions at sealevel, the average pressure exerted by theweight of the atmosphereis approximately 14.70 pounds per square inch (psi) of surface, or 1,013.2 millibars(mb).Thethicknessof theatmosphereislimited; therefore, the higher the altitude, the less air there is above. For this reason, the weight of the atmosphere at 18,000 feet isone-halfwhatitisatsealevel.  

The pressure of the atmosphere varies with time and location. Due to the changing atmospheric pressure, a standard reference was developed. The standard atmosphere at sea level is a surface temperature of  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  or  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and a surface pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury  $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$  or  $1{,}013{.}2~\mathrm{mb}$  [Figure4-2]  

Astandardtemperaturelapserateiswhenthetemperature decreases at therateof approximately  $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Or  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  per thousand feet upto36,000feet, which is approximately  $-65$   $\mathrm{{}^{\circ}F}$  Or  $-55\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  .Above this point, the temperature is considered constantupto80,Oo0feet.A standard pressure lapse rate is when pressure decreases at a rate of approximately  $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  per1,000 feet of altitude gain to 10,000feet.[Figure4-3] The International Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO)has established this as a worldwide standard,anditisoften

referred to as International Standard Atmosphere(ISA)on ICAO Standard Atmosphere. Any temperature or pressure that differs from the standard lapse rates is considered nonstandard temperature and pressure.  

Since aircraft performance is compared and evaluated with respect to the standard atmosphere, all aircraft instruments are calibrated for the standard atmosphere.In order toproperly account for the nonstandard atmosphere,certain related terms mustbedefined.  

# Pressure Altitude  

Pressure altitudeis theheight above a standard datum plane (SDP),which is a theoretical level where the weight of the atmosphereis  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   $^{1,013.2\mathrm{~mb}}$  )as measured by a barometer.An altimeter is essentially a sensitive barometer calibrated toindicate altitude in the standard atmosphere. If the altimeter is set for  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg\;SDP}$  ,the altitude indicated is the pressure altitude. As atmospheric pressure changes, the SDP may be below, at, or above sea level. Pressure altitude isimportant as abasisfor determining airplane performance, as well as for assigning flight levels to airplanes operating at or above 18,000 feet.  

The pressure altitude can be determined by one of the following methods:  

1. Setting the barometric scale of the altimeter to 29.92 and reading the indicated altitude 2. Applying a correction factor to the indicated altitude according to the reported altimeter setting  

# DensityAltitude  

SDPis a theoretical pressure altitude,but aircraft operatein a nonstandard atmosphere and the term density altitude is used for correlating aerodynamic performancein the nonstandard atmosphere.Density altitude is the vertical distance above sea level in the standard atmosphere at which a given density is tobefound.Thedensityof air has significant effects on the aircraft's performance because as air becomes less dense, itreduces:  

Power because the engine takes in less air Thrust because a propeller is less efficient in thin air Liftbecause the thin airexerts less force onthe airfoils  

Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature.As the density of the air increases (lower density altitude), aircraft performance increases; conversely as air density decreases(higher densityaltitude),aircraft performance decreases.A decrease in air density means a high density altitude; an increase in air density means a lower density altitude.Density altitude is used in calculating aircraft performance because under standard atmospheric conditions, air at each level in the atmosphere not only has a specific density, its pressure altitude and density altitude identify the same level.  

The computation of density altitude involves consideration ofpressure(pressure altitude)andtemperature.Sinceaircraft performancedata at anylevelisbased upon air densityunder standard day conditions,such performance data apply to air density levels that may not be identical with altimeter indications.Under conditions higher or lower than standard these levels cannot be determined directly from the altimeter.  

Density altitude is determined by first finding pressure altitude, and then correcting this altitude for nonstandard temperature variations.Since density varies directlywith pressure and inversely with temperature, a given pressure altitude may exist for awide range of temperaturesby allowing the density to vary. However, a known density occurs for any one temperature and pressure altitude. The density of the air has a pronounced effect on aircraft and engine performance.Regardless of the actual altitude of the aircraft, it will perform as though it were operating at an altitudeequal to the existing density altitude.  

Airdensityis affected by changes in altitude,temperature. andhumidity.Highdensity altitude refers to thin air,while low density altitude refers to dense air.The conditions that result in a high density altitude are high elevations,low atmospheric pressures,high temperatures,highhumidity,or some combination of thesefactors.Lowerelevations,high atmospheric pressure,lowtemperatures,andlowhumidity are more indicative of low density altitude  

# Effect ofPressure onDensity  

Since air is a gas,it can be compressed or expanded.When airiscompressed,a greater amount of air can occupy a given volume.Conversely, when pressure on a given volume of air is decreased, the air expands and occupies a greater space At a lower pressure, the original column of air contains a smaller mass of air.The densityis decreased because density is directly proportional to pressure. If the pressure is doubled, the density is doubled;if the pressure is lowered,thedensityis lowered.This statement is true only at a constant temperature  

# Effect of Temperature on Density  

Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its density. Conversely,decreasing the temperature increases the density. Thus, the density of air varies inversely with temperature.Thisstatementis true only ata constant pressure.  

Inthe atmosphere,bothtemperature and pressure decrease with altitude and have conflicting effects upon density. However,afairlyrapid dropinpressure as altitude increases usuallyhas a dominating effect.Hence,pilots can expect the density to decrease with altitude.  

# Effect of Humidity(Moisture)onDensity  

The preceding paragraphs refer to air that is perfectly dry. In reality,it is never completely dry.The small amount of water vapor suspended in the atmospheremaybe almost negligible under certain conditions,but inother conditions humidity may become an important factor in the performance of an aircraft. Water vapor is lighter than air; consequently, moist air islighter thandryair.Therefore,as the water content of the air increases, the air becomes less dense, increasing density altitude and decreasing performance.Itislightest or least dense when, in a given set of conditions, it contains the maximumamountofwatervapor.  

Humidity,also called relative humidity,referstothe amount of water vapor contained in the atmosphere and is expressed as a percentage of themaximum amount of watervapor the air canhold.This amount varies with temperature.Warm air holds more water vapor, while cold air holds less. Perfectly dry air that contains nowater vapor has a relative humidity of zero percent, while saturated air, which cannot hold any more water vapor, has a relative humidity of 1o0 percent. Humidity alone is usually not considered an important factor in calculating density altitude and aircraft performance, but itisacontributingfactor.  

As temperature increases, the air can hold greater amounts of water vapor. When comparing two separate air masses, the first warm and moist (both qualities tending to lighten the air) and the second cold and dry (both qualities making it heavier),the first must be less dense than the second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity have a great influence on aircraft performance because of their effect upon density. There are no rules of thumb that can be easily applied, but the affect of humidity can be determined using several online formulas. In the first example, the pressure is needed at the altitude for which density altitude is being sought. Using Figure4-2,select the barometric pressure closest to the associated altitude.As an example, the pressure at 8,000 feet is  $22.22\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA） website(www.srh.noaa.gov/epz/?n  $=$  w x calc density altitude) for density altitude, enter the 22.22for 8,000feet in the station pressure window.Enter atemperatureof  $80^{\circ}$  andadewpointof  $75^{\circ}$  .Theresultisa density altitude of11,564feet.With nohumidity,the density altitude would be almost 500 feet lower.  

Another website(www.wahiduddin.net/calc/density_ altitude.htm)provides a more straightforward method of determining the effects of humidity on density altitude without using additional interpretive charts.In any case, the effects of humidity on density altitude include a decrease in overall performance in high humidity conditions.  

# Theories intheProduction of Lift  

In order to achieve flight in a machine that is heavier than air. there are several obstacles we must overcome.Oneofthose obstacles,discussed previously,is the resistance to movement called drag. The most challenging obstacle to overcome in aviation,however, is the force of gravity. A wing moving through air generates the force called lift, also previously discussed. Lift from the wing that is greater than the force of gravity, directed opposite to the direction of gravity, enables an aircraft to fly. Generating this force called lift is based on some important principles, Newton's basic laws of motion, andBernoulli's principle of differential pressure.  

# Newton's Basic Laws of Motion  

Theformulation of lift has historically been an adaptatior over the past few centuries of basicphysical laws.These laws, although seemingly applicable to all aspects of lift, do not explain how lift is formulated.Infact,onemust consider the many airfoils that aresymmetrical,yetproduce significantlift.  

The fundamental physical laws governing the forces acting upon an aircraft in flight were adopted from postulated theories developed before any human successfully flew an aircraft. The use of these physical laws grew out of the Scientific Revolution, which began in Europe in the 1600s. Drivenby thebelief the universe operated in a predictable manner open to human understanding, many philosophers. mathematicians,natural scientists,and inventors spent their lives unlocking the secrets of the universe. One of the most well-known was Sir Isaac Newton, who not only formulated the law of universal gravitation,but also described the three basic laws of motion.  

Newton's First Law: "Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed onit."  

This means that nothing starts or stops moving until some outside force causes it to do so. An aircraft at rest on the ramp remains at rest unless a force strong enough to overcome its inertia is applied. Once it is moving, its inertia keeps it moving, subject to the various other forces acting on it These forces may add to its motion, slow it down, or change itsdirection.  

Newton's Second Law:“Force is equal to the change in momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration."  

Whenabodyis acteduponby aconstantforce,itsresulting acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the body and is directly proportional to the applied force. This takes into account the factors involved in overcoming Newton's First Law. It covers both changes in direction and speed, including starting up from rest (positive acceleration) and comingtoastop(negative acceleration or deceleration).  

Newton's Third Law: “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."  

In an airplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the air;consequently,the air pushes the propeller(andthusthe airplane)in the opposite direction—forward.In ajet airplane, theenginepushes a blast of hot gases backward;theforceof equal and opposite reaction pushes against the engine and forces the airplane forward.  

# Bernoulli's Principle of Differential Pressure  

Ahalf-centuryafter Newton formulated his laws,Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician,explained howthe pressure of a moving fluid(liquid or gas)varies with its speed of motion.Bernoulli's Principle states that as the velocity of a movingfluid(liquidorgas)increases,the pressure within the fluid decreases.This principle explains what happens to air passing over the curved top of the airplanewing  

A practical application of Bernoulli's Principle is the venturi tube. The venturi tube has an air inlet that narrows to a throat (constricted point) and an outlet section that increases in diameter toward the rear.The diameter of the outlet is the same as that of the inlet. The mass of air entering the tube must exactly equal the mass exiting the tube.At the constriction,the speed must increase to allow the same amount of air topass in the same amount of time as in all other parts of the tube.When the airspeed sup,thepressure also decreases. Past the constriction,the airflow slows and the pressure increases.[Figure4-4]  

Since air is recognized as a body,and it is understood that air will follow the above laws,one can begin to see how andwhy an airplane wing develops lift.As thewingmoves throughthe air,theflowof air across thecurved topsurface increases in velocity creating a low-pressure area.  

Although Newton, Bernoulli, and hundreds of other early scientists who studied the physical laws of the universe did nothavethesophisticatedlaboratoriesavailabletoday,they provided great insight to thecontemporary viewpoint of how liftiscreated.  

# Airfoil Design  

An airfoil is a structure designed to obtain reaction upon its surface from the air through which it moves or that moves past such a structure.Air acts in various ways when submitted to different pressures and velocities;but this discussion is confined totheparts of an aircraft that apilot is most concerned within flight namely,the airfoils designed to produce lift. By looking at a typical airfoil profile, such as the cross section of a wing,one can see several obvious characteristics of design.[Figure4-5]Notice that there is a difference in the curvatures (called cambers) of the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. The camber of the upper surface is more pronounced than that of the lower surface, which is usually somewhat flat.  

NOTE: The two extremities of the airfoil profile also differ in appearance. The rounded end, which faces forward in flight, is called the leading edge; the other end, the trailing edge, is quite narrow and tapered.  

A reference line often used in discussing the airfoil is thechordline,a straight line drawn through the profile connecting the extremities of theleading and trailing edges. Thedistancefromthischordlinetotheupperandlower surfaces of the wing denotes the magnitude of the upper and lower camber at any point.Another reference line,drawn

Figure4-5.Typical airfoil section  

from theleadingedge to the trailing edge,is themeancamber line. This mean line is equidistant at all points from the upper and lower surfaces.  

An airfoil is constructed in such a way that its shape takes advantageofthe air's response to certain physical laws.This develops two actionsfrom the airmass:a positive pressure lifting action from the air mass below the wing,and a negative pressurelifting action from lowered pressure above thewing  

As the air stream strikes the relatively flat lower surface of awingorrotorbladewheninclinedatasmallangletoits direction of motion,the air is forced to rebound downward, causing an upward reaction in positive lift.Atthesametime. the air stream striking the upper curved section of the leading edge is deflected upward.An airfoil is shaped to cause an actiononthe air,and forces air downward,whichprovides an equal reaction from the air, forcing the airfoil upward. If a wing is constructed in such form that it causes a lift force greater than the weight of the aircraft, the aircraft will fly.  

If all the lift required were obtained merely from the deflection of airby thelowersurface of thewing,an aircraft would only need a flat wing like a kite.However, the balance of the lift needed to support the aircraft comes from the flow of air above the wing. Herein lies the key to flight.  

It is neither accurate nor useful to assign specific values to the percentage of lift generated by the upper surface of an airfoil versus that generated by the lower surface. These are not constant values. Theyvary,not only withflight conditions, but also with different wing designs.  

Different airfoils have different flight characteristics. Many thousandsof airfoils have been tested in wind tunnels andin actual flight, but no one airfoil has been found that satisfies every flight requirement. The weight, speed, and purpose of each aircraft dictate the shape of its airfoil.Themost efficient airfoil for producing the greatest lift is one that has a concave or“scooped out"lower surface.As a fixed design, this type of airfoil sacrifices too much speed while producing lift and is not suitable for high-speed flight. Advancements in engineering have made it possible for today's high-speed jets to take advantage of the concave airfoil'shighlift characteristics. Leading edge (Kreuger) flaps and trailing edge (Fowler) flaps, when extended from the basic wing structure,literallychangetheairfoilshapeintotheclassic concave form, thereby generating much greater lift during slow flight conditions.  

Ontheother hand,an airfoil that is perfectly streamlined andofferslittlewindresistancesometimesdoesnothave enough lifting power to take the airplane off the ground. Thus,modern airplaneshave airfoils that strikea medium between extremes in design. The shape varies according to the needs of the airplane for which itis designed.Figure 4-6 shows some of the more common airfoil designs  

# Low Pressure Above  

In a wind tunnel orin flight, an airfoil is simply a streamlined object inserted into a moving stream of air. If the airfoil profile were in the shape of ateardrop,thespeedandthe pressure changes of the air passing over the top and bottom would be the same on both sides. But if the teardrop shaped airfoil were cut in half lengthwise,a form resembling the basic airfoil (wing) section would result. If the airfoil were then inclined so the airflow strikes it at an angle, the air moving over theupper surfacewould beforced tomove faster than the air moving along the bottom of the airfoil. This increased velocity reduces the pressure above the airfoil.  

Applying Bernoulli's Principle of Pressure, the increase in the speed of the air across the top of an airfoil produces a  

![](images/0f36a3174ee40ccab16cb90f66298ad7d104a2789c90bf7bdaa499922de4d350.jpg)  
Figure 4-6.Airfoil designs  

drop in pressure. This lowered pressure is a component of total lift. The pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaceof a wing alone does not account for the total lift force produced.  

The downward backward flow from the top surface of an airfoil creates a down wash.This down wash meets the flow from thebottom of the airfoil at the trailing edge.Applying Newton's thirdlaw, the reaction of this downward backward flowresultsin an upward forward force on the airfoil.  

# High Pressure Below  

Acertain amount of lift is generated by pressure conditions underneath the airfoil.Because of the manner in which air flows underneath the airfoil,a positive pressure results, particularly at higher angles of attack.However,there is another aspect to this airflow that must be considered.At a point close to the leading edge,the air flow is virtually stopped (stagnation point)and then gradually increases speed.At some point near the trailing edge,it againreaches avelocity equal to that on the upper surface. In conformance with Bernoulli'sprinciple,wheretheairflowwasslowedbeneath the airfoil, a positive upward pressure was created (i.e., as the fluid speed decreases,the pressure mustincrease).Since thepressure differential between theupper andlowersurface of the airfoil increases, total lift increases. Both Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's Laws are in operation whenever lift is being generated by an airfoil.  

# Pressure Distribution  

From experiments conducted on wind tunnel models andon full size airplanes, it has been determined that as air flows along the surface of a wing at different angles of attack (AOA),there are regions along the surface where thepressure is negative, or less than atmospheric, and regions where the pressure is positive, or greater than atmospheric. This negative pressure on theupper surfacecreates a relatively largerforce on the wing than is caused by the positive pressure resulting from the air striking thelower wing surface.Figure 4-7shows the pressure distribution along an airfoil at three different angles of attack. The average of the pressure variation for any given AOA is referred to as the center of pressure (CP). Aerodynamic force acts through thisCP.Athighangles of attack,the CP moves forward,while at low angles of attack the CP moves aft. In the design of wing structures, this CP travel is very important,since it affects the position of the air loads imposed on the wing structure in both low and high AOA conditions.An airplane's aerodynamic balance and control l ability are governed by changes in the CP  

# Airfoil Behavior  

Although specific examples can be cited in which each of the principles predict and contribute to the formation of lift.  

![](images/f5d8988414b8658ebb7939df8c609c2a0cb112c4aae9f43d2c8f3b97be13b803.jpg)  
Figure4-7.Pressure distribution on an airfoil and  $C P$  changes withAOA.  

liftis a complexsubject.The production of lift is much more complex than a simple differential pressure between upper andlower airfoilsurfaces.Infact,many lifting airfoils do not have an upper surfacelonger thanthebottom,as in the case of symmetrical airfoils.These are seen in high-speed aircraft having symmetrical wings,or on symmetrical rotor bladesfor many helicopters whose upper and lower surfaces are identical. In both examples, the only difference is the relationship of the airfoil with the oncoming air stream (angle). A paper airplane, which is simply a flat plate, has a bottom and top exactly the same shape and length. Yet, these airfoils do produce lift, and “flow turning"is partly (or fully) responsible for creating lift  

As an airfoil moves through air,theairfoil isinclined against the airflow, producing a different flow caused by the airfoil's relationship to the oncoming air. Think of a hand beingplaced outside the car window at ahigh speed.If the hand is inclined in one direction or another,thehand will move upward or downward.This is caused by deflection, which in turn causes the air to turn about the object within the air stream.As a result of this change, the velocity about the object changes in both magnitude and direction, in turn resulting in a measurable velocity force and direction.  

# A Third Dimension  

To this point, the discussion has centered on the flow across theupper andlowersurfacesofanairfoil.Whilemostofthe lift is produced by these two dimensions, a third dimension, the tip of the airfoil alsohas an aerodynamic effect. The high- pressure area on the bottom of an airfoil pushes around the tip to thelow-pressure area on the top.[Figure 4-8] This action creates a rotating flow called a tip vortex.Thevortexflows behindthe airfoil creating a down wash that extends back to the trailing edge of the airfoil.This down wash results in an overall reduction in lift for the affected portion of the airfoil. Manufacturers have developed different methods to counteract this action.Winglets can be added to the tip of an airfoil to reduce this flow. The winglets act as a dam preventing the vortex from forming.Winglets can be on the top or bottom of the airfoil. Another method of countering the flow is to taper the airfoil tip, reducing the pressure differential and smoothing the airflow around the tip

Modern general aviation aircraft have what may be considered high performance characteristics.Therefore,itis increasingly necessary that pilots appreciate and understand the principles upon which the art of flying is based.For additional information on the principles discussed in this chapter, visit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Beginner's Guide to Aerodynamics at www.grc.nasa.gov/ www/k-12/airplane/bga.html.  

# Chapter 5 Aerodynamics of Flight  

# Forces Acting on the Aircraft  

Thrust, drag, lift, and weight are forces that act upon all aircraft in flight. Understanding how these forces work and knowing how to control themwith the use of power and flight controls are essential to flight. This chapter discusses the aerodynamics of flight-how design, weight, load factors, and gravity affect an aircraft during flight maneuvers.  

The four forces acting on an aircraft in straight-and-level, unaccelerated flight are thrust, drag, lift, and weight. They are defined as follows:  

Thrustthe forward force produced by the powerplant/ propeller or rotor. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag. As a general rule, it acts parallel to the longitudinal axis. However, this is not always the case, as explainedlater.  

Drag-a rearward, retarding force caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, rotor, fuselage, and other protruding objects. As a general rule, drag opposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind.  

Lift —-is a force that is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the airfoil, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the center of lift (CL) and perpendicular to the lateral axis. In level flight, lift opposes the downward force of weight  

Weightthecombinedloadoftheaircraftitself,the crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight is a force that pulls the aircraft downward because of the force of gravity. It opposes lift and acts vertically downward through the aircraft's center of gravity (CG).  

Insteadyflight,the sum of these opposing forces is always zero.There can be no unbalanced forces in steady,straight flight based upon Newton'sThirdLaw,which states that for every action or force there is an equal,butopposite,reaction orforce.This is true whether flying level or when climbing ordescending  

It does not mean the four forces are equal.Itmeansthe opposing forces are equal to, and thereby cancel, the effects of each other. In Figure 5-1, the force vectors of thrust, drag, lift. and weight appear to be equalinvalue. The usual explanation states(without stipulating that thrust and drag do not equal weight andlift) that thrust equals drag and lift equals weight. Although true, this statement can be misleading. It should be understood that in straight, level, unaccelerated flight, it is true that the opposinglift/weight forces are equal. They are alsogreaterthantheopposingforcesofthrust/dragthatare equal only to each other. Therefore, in steady flight:  

The sum of all upward components of forces (not just lift)equals the sum of all downward components of forces(notjustweight)The sum of all forward components of forces(notjust thrust)equals the sum of all backward components of forces(not justdrag)  

This refinement of the old “thrust equals drag; lift equals weight"formula explains that a portion of thrust is directed upward in climbs and slow flight and acts as if it were lift while a portion of weight is directed backward opposite to the direction of flight and acts as if it were drag. In slow flight  

![](images/06b35291daff00be73b97959186cce3d70a5ccb98038cd403a69c309983c9468.jpg)  
Figure5-1.Relationship of forces acting on an aircraft  

thrust has an upward component. But because the aircraft is in level flight,weight does not contribute to drag.[Figure 5-2]  

In glides, a portion of the weight vector is directed along the forward flight path and, therefore, acts as thrust. In other words,any time theflight path of the aircraft is not horizontal. lift, weight, thrust, and drag vectors must each be broken down into two components.  

Another important concept to understand is angle of attack (AOA).Sincetheearlydaysofflight,AOAisfundamentalto understanding many aspects of airplane performance, stability, andcontrol.The AO A is defined as the acute angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the direction of the relative wind.  

Discussions of the preceding concepts arefrequently omitted in aeronautical texts/handbooks/manuals.Thereasonis not that they are inconsequential, but because the main ideas with respect to the aerodynamic forces acting upon an aircraft in flight can be presented in their most essential elementswithout beinginvolved in the technicalities of the aerodynamicist.Inpointoffact,considering only level flight and normal climbs and glides in a steady state, it is still true that lift provided by the wing or rotor is the primary upward force,and weight is the primary downward force.  

By using the aerodynamic forces of thrust, drag, lift, and weight, pilots can fly a controlled, safe flight. A more detailed discussion of these forces follows.  

# Thrust  

For an aircraft to start moving, thrust must be exerted and be greater than drag. The aircraft continues to move and gain speed until thrust and drag are equal. In order to maintain a  

![](images/aee43f19833c0c46235afecf5a8002255c73ea764cd2083c160d6b7c4cf91085.jpg)  
Figure5-2.Forcevectors during a stabilized climb.  

constant airspeed, thrust and drag must remain equal, just as lift and weight must be equal to maintain a constant altitude. If in level flight, the engine power is reduced, the thrust is lessened,and the aircraft slows down.As long as the thrust is less than the drag,the aircraft continues todecelerate.To apoint,as the aircraft slows down,the drag force will also decrease.The aircraft will continue to slowdown until thrust again equals drag at which point the airspeed will stabilize  

Likewise, if the engine power is increased, thrust becomes greater than dragand the airspeed increases.Aslong as the thrust continues to be greater than the drag, the aircraft continues to accelerate. When drag equals thrust, the aircraft flies at a constant airspeed.  

Straight-and-level flight may be sustained at a wide range of speeds.The pilot coordinates AOA and thrust in all speed regimes if the aircraft is to be held in level flight. An important fact related to the principal of lift (for a given airfoilshape)is that lift varies with the AO A and airspeed. Therefore, a large AOA at low airspeeds produces an equal amount of lift at high airspeed s with a low AO A.Thespeed regimes of flight can be grouped in three categories: low- speed flight, cruising flight, and high-speed flight.  

When the airspeed is low, the AOA must be relatively high if thebalance between lift and weight is tobe maintained. [Figure5-3]If thrust decreases and airspeed decreases,lift will become less thanweight and the aircraftwill start to descend.To maintainlevel flight, the pilot can increase the AOA an amount that generates a lift force again equal to the weight of the aircraft.Whilethe aircraft will be flying more slowly,it will still maintain level flight.The AO A is adjusted to maintain lift equal weight.The airspeed will naturally adjust until drag equals thrust and then maintain that airspeed (assumes the pilot is not trying to hold anexactspeed).  

Straight-and-level flight in the slow-speed regime provides some interesting conditions relative to the equilibrium of forces. With the aircraft in a nose-high attitude,there is a vertical component of thrust that helps support it. For one thing,wing loading tends to be less than would be expected.  

Inlevelflight,when thrust is increased,the aircraft speeds upandtheliftincreases.Theaircraftwillstarttoclimb unless the AO A is decreased just enough to maintain the relationship between lift and weight.Thetimingofthis decrease in AO A needs to be coordinated with the increase in thrust and airspeed.Otherwise,if the AO A is decreased too fast,the aircraft will descend,and if the AO A is decreased tooslowly,the aircraft will climb.  

As the airspeed varies due to thrust, the AOA must alsovary to maintain level flight. At very high speeds and level flight it is evenpossible tohave a slightly negative AO A.As thrust is reduced and airspeed decreases,the AOA must increase in order tomaintain altitude.If speed decreasesenough,the required AO A will increase to the critical AO A.Anyfurther increase in theAOA will result in the wingstalling. Therefore, extra vigilance is required at reduced thrust settings and low speedssoasnottoexceedthecriticalangleofattack.Ifthe airplane is equipped with an AOA indicator, it should be referenced tohelpmonitor theproximity to thecritical AOA.  

Some aircraft have the ability to change the direction of the thrust rather than changing the AOA.This is accomplished either by pivoting the engines or by vectoring the exhaust gases.[Figure5-4]  

# Lift  

The pilot can control the lift. Any time the control yoke orstickismovedforeoraft,theAOAischanged.Asthe AOA increases, lift increases (all other factors being equal)) When the aircraft reaches the maximum AOA, lift begins to diminish rapidly. This is the stalling AOA,known as

  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  critical AOA.Examine Figure 5-5, noting how the

  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  increases until the critical AOA is reached,then decreases rapidly with any further increase in the AOA.  

Before proceeding further with the topic of lift and how it canbecontrolled,velocity must be discussed.Theshapeof the wing or rotor cannot be effective unless it continually keeps “attacking” new air. If an aircraft is to keep flying, the lift-producing airfoil must keep moving.In ahelicopter or gyroplane, this is accomplished by the rotation of the rotor blades. For other types of aircraft, such as airplanes, weight  

![](images/7d24eb5ec7c583a9b2fd150eb28c91c6c119a90e78cf66e857988f6d7e77f471.jpg)

Figure5-4.Some aircraft have the ability to change the direction of thrust  

shift control, or gliders, air must be moving across the lifting surface.This is accomplished by the forward speed of the aircraft.Lift is proportional to the square of the aircraft's velocity.Forexample,an airplane traveling at 200knotshas four times the lift as the same airplane traveling at 100 knots, if theAOA and other factors remain constant.  

$$
\mathsf{L}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{L}}\cdot\mathsf{\rho}\cdot\mathsf{V}^{2}\cdot\mathsf{S}}{2}
$$  

The above lift equation exemplifies this mathematically and supports that doubling of the airspeed will result in four times the lift.As a result, one can see that velocity is an important component to the production of lift, which itself canbe affected through varying AOA.When examining the equation,lift (L) is determined through the relationship of the air density (p), the airfoil velocity (V), the surface area of the wing(S) and the coefficient oflift  $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$  for a given airfoil.  

Taking the equation further, one can see an aircraft could notcontinue to travel in level flight at a constant altitude and maintain thesame AOA if thevelocity is increased.The lift would increase and the aircraft would climb as a result of the increased lift force or speed up. Therefore, to keep the aircraft straight and level (not accelerating upward) and in a state of equilibrium, as velocity is increased,lift must be kept constant. This is normally accomplished by reducing the AOA by lowering the nose. Conversely, as the aircraft is slowed, the decreasing velocity requires increasing the AOA tomaintain lift sufficient to maintain flight.There is,of course, a limit to how far the AO A can be increased,if as tallis to be avoided.  

All other factors being constant, for every AOA there is a corresponding airspeed required to maintain altitude in steady,unaccelerated flight (true only if maintaining level flight). Since an airfoil always stalls at the same AOA, if increasing weight, lift must also be increased. The only  

![](images/c0af2a4a6aca99ee26503648876c9e6dc2f6030b8e742a5c3e09b516d6f06c1b.jpg)  
Figure5-5.Coefficients of lift and drag at various angles of attack  

method of increasing lift is by increasing velocity if the AOA is held constant just short of the“critical,”or stalling,AOA (assuming no flaps or other high lift devices).  

Lift and drag also vary directly with the density of the air. Densityis affected by several factors:pressure,temperature, and humidity. At an altitude of 18,000 feet, the density of theairhasone-half the density of air at sea level.Inorder to maintainitslift atahigher altitude,an aircraft must fly at a greatertrue airspeedfor anygivenAOA.  

Warm air is less dense than cool air, and moist air is less dense than dry air. Thus, on a hot humid day, an aircraft must be flown at a greater true airspeed for any given AOA than on a cool, dry day.  

If the density factor is decreased and the total lift must equal the total weight toremain in flight, it follows that one of the other factors must be increased. The factor usually increased is the airspeed or the AOA because these are controlled directlybythepilot.  

Lift varies directly with the wing area, provided there is no change in the wing's planform. If the wings have the same proportion and airfoil sections, a wing with a planform area of 200 squarefeet lifts twice as much at the sameAOA as a wing with an area of 1 o 0 square feet.  

Twomajor aerodynamic factors from the pilot'sviewpoint are lift and airspeed because they can be controlled readily and accurately.Ofcourse,thepilotcan also control density by adjusting the altitude and can control wing area if the aircraft happens to have flaps of the type that enlarge wing area. However, for most situations, the pilot controls lift and airspeed to maneuver an aircraft. For instance, in straight-and-level flight cruising along at a constant altitude, altitude is maintained by adjusting lift to match the aircraft's velocity or cruise airspeed, while maintaining a state of equilibrium in which lift equals weight. In an approach to landing, when the pilot wishes to land as slowly as practical, it is necessary to increase AOA near maximum to maintain lift equal to theweightof the aircraft  

# Lift/DragRatio  

The lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is the amount of lift generated by awingorairfoilcomparedtoitsdrag.Aratioof L/Dindicates airfoil efficiency. Aircraft with higher L/D ratios are more efficient than those with lower L/Dratios.Inunaccelerated flight with the lift and drag data steady, the proportions of thecoefficientoflift  $(\mathrm{C_{L}})$  andcoefficient ofdrag  $(\mathrm{C_{D}})$  can be calculated for specific AOA.[Figure 5-5]  

The coefficient of lift is dimensionless and relates the lift generated by a lifting body, the dynamic pressure of the fluid flow around the body, and a reference area associated with thebody.The coefficientof dragis also dimensionless andis used to quantify the drag of an object in a fluid environment, suchasair,and is always associated with a particular surface area.  

The L/D ratio is determined by dividing the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  by the  $\mathrm{C_{D}}$  which is the same as dividing the lift equation by the drag equation as all of the variables, aside from the coefficients, cancelout.Thelift and dragequations are asfollows  $\mathrm{L}=$  Lift in pounds;  $\mathrm{D}\!=$  Drag;  $\mathrm{C_{L}}\mathrm{=}$  coefficient of lift;  $\uprho\,{=}\,$  density (expressed in slugs per cubic feet);  $\mathrm{V}=$  velocity(infeetper second);  $\mathbf{q}=$  dynamic pressure per square foot  $(\mathsf{q}=\mathrm{\mathbb{V}}_{2}\,\mathsf{p}\mathrm{\mathrm{v}}^{2})$  ”

  $\mathrm{S}=$  the area of the lifting body (in square feet);and

  $\mathrm{C_{D}}\!=$  Ratio of dragpressureto dynamicpressure):  

$$
\mathsf{D}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}\cdot\mathsf{P}\cdot\mathsf{V}^{2}\cdot\mathsf{S}}{2}
$$  

Typically atlowAOA,thecoefficient of drag islowand small changes in AOA create only slight changes in the coefficient of drag.AthighAOA,small changes in the AO A cause significant changesin drag.The shape of an airfoil, as well as changes in the AO A,affects the production of lift  

NoticeinFigure5-5 that the coefficient of lift curve (red) reaches its maximum for this particular wing section at  $20^{\circ}$  AO A and then rapidly decreases.  $20^{\circ}$  AO A is therefore the critical angle of attack. The coefficient of drag curve (orange) increases very rapidly from  $14^{\circ}$  AOAand completely overcomes the lift curve at  $21^{\circ}$  AOA.Thelift/dragratio (green) reaches its maximum at  $6^{\circ}\,\mathrm{AOA}$  , meaning that at this angle, the most lift is obtained for the least amount of drag.  

Note that the maximum lift/drag ratio  $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  occurs at onespecific  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  and AOA.If the aircraft is operated in steady flight at  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , the total drag is at a minimum. Any AOA lower or higher than that for  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  reduces the L/D and consequently increases the total dragfor a given aircraft's

lift. Figure 5-6 depicts the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  by the lowest portion of the blue line labeled “total drag." The configuration of an aircraft has a great effect on the L/D.  

# Drag  

Drag is the force that resists movement of an aircraft through the air.There are twobasic types:parasite drag and induced drag.Thefirstis called parasitebecause it in noway functions to aid flight, while the second, induced drag, is a result of an airfoil developing lift.  

# Parasite Drag  

Parasite drag is comprised of all the forces that work to slow an aircraft's movement.As the term parasite implies, it is the drag that is not associated with the production of lift.This includes the displacement of the air by the aircraft,turbulence generatedin theairstream,or ahindranceof air movingover the surface of the aircraft and airfoil.There are three types of parasite drag: form drag, interference drag, and skin friction.  

# Form Drag  

Form drag is the portion of parasite drag generated by the aircraft due to its shape and air flow around it.Examplesinclude the engine cowlings, antennas,and the aerodynamic shape of othercomponents.When the air has to separate to move around a moving aircraft and its components,it eventually rejoins after passing the body.How quickly and smoothlyit rejoins is representative of the resistance that it creates,whichrequires additional force to overcome.[Figure5-7]  

NoticehowtheflatplateinFigure5-7causes theairtoswirl around the edges untilit eventually rejoins downstream.Form

Figure 5-7.Form drag  

drag is the easiest to reduce when designing an aircraft. The solutionis to streamline as many of theparts aspossible  

# Interference Drag  

Interference drag comes from the intersection of air streams that creates eddy currents,turbulence,or restricts smooth airflow.Forexample,the intersection of the wing and the fuselage at the wing root has significant interference drag. Air flowing around the fuselage collides with air flowing over the wing, merging into a current of air different from the two original currents.The most interference drag is observedwhen two surfaces meet at perpendicular angles. Fairings are used to reduce this tendency. If a jet fighter carries two identical wingtanks,the overall drag is greater than thesum of the individual tanks because both of these create and generate interference drag. Fairings and distance between lifting surfaces and external components(such as radar antennas hungfromwings)reduce interference drag.[Figure5-8]  

# Skin Friction Drag  

Skin friction drag is the aerodynamic resistance due to the contact of moving air with the surface of an aircraft.Every surface, no matter how apparently smooth, has a rough. ragged surface when viewed under a microscope. The air molecules,which come indirect contact with the surface of the wing, are virtually motionless. Each layer of molecules above the surface moves slightly faster until the molecules aremoving at thevelocity of the air moving around the aircraft. This speed is called the free-stream velocity. The area betweenthe wing and thefree-stream velocity level is about as wideas aplayingcard and is called the boundary layer.Atthe top of the boundary layer,the molecules increase velocity and move at the same speed as the molecules outside the boundary layer.The actual speed at which themolecules move depends upon the shape of the wing, the viscosity (stickiness) of theair throughwhich thewingor airfoil ismoving,and its compressibility(how much it can be compacted)  

![](images/0c0522aa91667a5ba3d998313c4471abda87165ad8823ad142a8de077a43a1c9.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.Awingrootcan causeinterference drag.  

The air flow outside of the boundary layer reacts to the shapeof theedgeof the boundary layer just asitwould to the physical surface of an object. The boundary layer gives any object an “effective” shape that is usually slightly different from the physical shape. The boundary layer may also separate from the body, thus creating an effective shape much different from the physical shape of the object. This change in the physical shape of the boundary layer causes a dramatic decrease in lift and an increase in drag. When this happens,the airfoil has stalled.  

Inordertoreducetheeffectofskinfrictiondrag,aircraft designers utilize flush mount rivets and remove any irregularities that may protrude above the wing surface. In addition,a smooth and glossy finish aids in transition of air across the surface of the wing. Since dirt on an aircraft disrupts the free flow of air and increases drag, keep the surfacesofanaircraftcleanandwaxed  

# Induced Drag  

The second basic type of drag is induced drag.It is an established physical fact that no system that does work in the mechanical sense can be 1 oO percent efficient.Thismeans that whatever the nature of the system,therequiredwork is obtained at the expense of certain additional work that is dissipatedorlostinthesystem.Themoreefficientthesystem, the smaller this loss.  

In level flight, the aerodynamic properties of a wing or rotor produce a required lift, but this can be obtained only at the expense of a certain penalty. The name given to this penalty is induced drag.Induced drag isinherent whenever an airfoil is producing lift and, in fact, this type of drag is inseparable from the production of lift. Consequently, it is always present if lift isproduced.  

Anairfoil(wing or rotor blade)produces the lift force by making use of the energy of the free airstream.Whenever an airfoil is producing lift,the pressure on the lower surface ofitisgreater than that on the upper surface(Bernoulli's Principle). As a result, the air tends to flow from the high pressure area below the tip upward to the low pressure area on the upper surface. In the vicinity of the tips, there is a tendency for these pressures to equalize, resulting in a lateral flow outward from the underside to the upper surface. This lateral flow imparts a rotational velocity to the air at the tips, creatingvortices that trail behind the airfoil.  

When the aircraft is viewed from the tail,thesevortices circulate counterclockwise about the right tip and clockwise aboutthelefttip.[Figure5-9]Astheair(andvortices)rolloff the back of your wing, they angle down, which is known as downwash.Figure5-10 shows the difference in down was hat  

![](images/8cf46ad9d2c5a7c621a4e09301e5fdb4d2867dd206ba3359a75ce328386a9f98.jpg)  
Figure5-9.Wingtipvortexfromacropduster  

altitude versus near the ground.Bearing in mind the direction of rotation of these vortices,it can be seen that they induce an upward flow of air beyond the tip and a down wash flow behind the wing's trailing edge. This induced downwash has nothing in common with the down wash that is necessary tc produce lift. It is,in fact, the source of induced drag  

Down wash points the relative wind downward,sothemore downwash you have, the more your relative wind points downward. That's important for one very good reason: lift is always perpendicular to the relative wind. In Figure 5-11, you can see that when you have less down wash,yourliftvector is more vertical, opposing gravity. And when you have more downwash, your lift vector points back more, causing induced drag. On top of that, it takes energy for your wings to create downwash and vortices, and that energy creates drag  

![](images/a5c7c6766ca81d1a69cfcf9d9bf39bc6bc2237e6be11761ca4444e40901e8d1b.jpg)

Figure5-11.The difference in down was hat altitude versus near theground.  

The greater the size and strength of the vortices and consequent down wash component on the net air flow over theairfoil,the greater the induced drag effect becomes.This down was hover the top of the airfoil at the tip has the same effect as bending the lift vector rearward;therefore,thelift is slightly aft of perpendicular to therelativewind,creating a rearward lift component. This is induced drag.  

In order to create a greater negative pressure on the top of an airfoil, the airfoil can be inclined to a higher AOA.If the AOA of a symmetrical airfoil were zero, there would be no pressure differential, and consequently, no downwash component and no induced drag. In any case, as AOA increases, induced drag increases proportionally. To state this another way—-the lower the airspeed, the greater the AOA required to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight and, therefore, the greater induced drag. The amount of induced drag varies inversely with the square of the airspeed.  

Conversely, parasite drag increases as the square of the airspeed.Thus,insteadystate,as airspeed decreases to near the stalling speed,the total drag becomes greater,due mainly to the sharp rise in induced drag.Similarly,asthe aircraft reaches its never-exceed speed  $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  , the total drag increases rapidly due to the sharp increase of parasite drag. As seen in Figure 5-6, at some given airspeed, total drag is at its minimum amount. In figuring the maximum range of aircraft, the thrust required to overcome drag is at a minimum if drag is at a minimum. The minimum power and maximum endurance occur at a different point  

# Weight  

Gravity is the pulling force that tends to draw all bodies to thecenterof theearth.The CG maybe considered as apoint at which all the weight of the aircraft is concentrated.If the aircraft were supported at its exact CG,it would balance in any attitude.Itwillbenoted that CGisof major importance in an aircraft, for its position has a great bearing upon stability. The allowable location of the CGi s determined by the general design of each particular aircraft. The designers determine how far the center of pressure (CP) will travel. It is important to understand that an aircraft'sweight is concentrated at the CG and the aerodynamic forces of lift occur at theCP.When the CGi s forward of theCP,thereisanatural tendencyfor the aircraft to want to pitch nose down. If the CP is forward of the CG, a nose up pitching moment is created. Therefore, designers fix the aft limit of the CG forward of the CP for the corresponding flight speed in order to retain flight equilibrium  

Weight has a definite relationship to lift. This relationship is simple, but important in understanding the aerodynamics of flying.Lift is the upward force on the wing acting perpendicular to the relative wind and perpendicular to the aircraft's lateral axis. Lift is required to counteract the aircraft's weight. In stabilized level flight, when the lift force is equal to the weight force, the aircraft is in a state ofequilibrium and neither accelerates upward or downward. If liftbecomes less than weight, the vertical speed will decrease. When lift is greater than weight, the vertical speed will increase.  

# WingtipVortices  

# Formation of Vortices  

The action ofthe airfoil thatgives an aircraft lift also causes induced drag. When an airfoil is flown at a positive AOA, a pressure differential exists between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. The pressure above the wing is less than atmospheric pressure and the pressure below the wing is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure. Since air always moves from high pressure toward low pressure, and the path of least resistance is toward the airfoil's tips there is a spanwise movement of air from the bottom of the airfoil outward from the fuselage around thetips.Thisflow of air results in “spillage” over the tips, thereby setting up a whirlpool of air called avortex.[Figure5-12]  

Atthesametime,the a iron the upper surface has a tendency toflow in toward the fuselage and off the trailing edge. This air current forms a similar vortex at the in board portion of the trailing edge of the airfoil, but because the fuselage limits the inward flow, the vortex is insignificant. Consequently, the deviation in flow direction is greatest at the outer tips where the unrestricted lateral flow is the strongest.  

![](images/99f9cda46d9af8259cfddd76dadb6318a0ca3c7a5e6ce1da5fc9b1c810406f34.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.Wingtipvortices  

As the air curls upward around the tip,it combines with the downwashtoformafast-spinningtrailingvortex.These vortices increase drag because of energy spent in producing the turbulence. Whenever an airfoil is producing lift, induced drag occurs and wingtip vortices are created.  

Just as lift increases with an increase in AO A,induced drag also increases.This occurs because as the AO A is increased,there is a greater pressure difference between the top and bottom of the airfoil,and a greater lateral flow of air; consequently,this causes more violent vortices to be set up, resultinginmore turbulence and moreinduced drag  

InFigure5-12,it is easy to see the formation of wingtip vortices.The intensity or strength of the vortices is directly proportional to theweight of the aircraft and inversely proportional to the wingspan and speed of the aircraft. The heavier and slower the aircraft, the greater the AOA and the stronger the wingtipvortices.Thus,anaircraft will create wingtip vortices with maximum strength occurring during the takeoff, climb, and landing phases of flight. These vortices lead to a particularly dangerous hazard to flight waketurbulence.  

# Avoiding Wake Turbulence  

Wingtipvortices aregreatestwhen thegenerating aircraft is "heavy,clean,and slow."This conditionis most commonly encountered during approaches or departures because an aircraft's AOAis at the highest to produce thelift necessary to land or take off. To minimize the chances of flying through anaircraft'swaketurbulence:  

Avoid flying through another aircraft's flight path. Rotate prior to the point at which the preceding aircraft rotatedwhen taking off behind another aircraft. Avoidfollowing another aircraft on a similar flight path at an altitude within1,000feet.[Figure 5-13] Approach the runway above a preceding aircraft's path when landing behind another aircraft and touch down after thepoint at which the other aircraft wheels contacted the runway.[Figure5-14]  

A hovering helicopter generates a down wash from its main rotor(s) similar to the vortices of an airplane. Pilots of small aircraft should avoid a hovering helicopter by atleast three rotordiscdiameterstoavoidtheeffectsofthisdownwash.In forward flight, this energy is transformed into a pair of strong, high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing-tipvortices oflarger fixed-wingaircraft.Helicopter vortices should be avoided because helicopter forward flight airspeeds are often very slow and can generate exceptionally strong wake turbulence.  

Wind is an important factor in avoiding wake turbulence because wingtip vortices drift with thewind atthespeedofthe wind.Forexample, a wind speed of 10knots causes the vortices todrift at about 1,ooofeet in aminutein thewind direction. When following another aircraft, a pilot should consider wind speed and direction when selecting an intended takeoff or landing point. If a pilot is unsure of the other aircraft's takeoff or landing point, approximately 3 minutes provides a margin of

# GroundEffect  

Ever since the beginning of manned flight,pilotsrealized that just before touchdown it would suddenly feel like the aircraft did not want togolower, and it would just want to go on and on. This is due to the air that is trapped between the wing and the landing surface,as if there were an air cushion. Thisphenomenon is calledground effect.  

When an aircraft in flight comes within several feet of the surface,ground or water,a change occurs in the three- dimensional flow pattern around the aircraft because the vertical component of the air flow around the wing is restrictedbythesurface.Thisaltersthewing'supwash, downwash,and wingtipvortices.[Figure5-16]Ground effect, then, is due to the interference of the ground (or water) surfacewiththe air flow patterns about the aircraft in flight While the aerodynamic characteristics of the tail surfaces and thefuselage are altered by ground effect, the principal effects due to proximity of the ground are the changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing.As thewing encounters ground effect and is maintained at a constant AOA,there is consequent reduction in the upwash, downwash,and wingtip vortices.  

Induced drag is a result of the airfoil's work of sustaining theaircraft,and awing or rotor lifts the aircraft simplyby accelerating a mass of air downward.It is true that reduced pressure on top of an airfoil is essential to lift,butthat is only one of the things contributing to the overall effect of pushing an air mass downward. The more downwash there is, the harder the wing pushes the mass of air down. At high angles of attack, the amount of induced drag is high; since this corresponds to lower airspeeds in actual flight, it can be said that induced drag predominates at low speed. However, the reductionofthewingtipvorticesduetogroundeffectalters  

![](images/e9958a6d9e895914456e6c7e2ed2e04b51760c3461d26e49582d8f588cae2377.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.Ground effect changes airflow  

the span wise lift distribution andreduces theinducedAOA and induced drag. Therefore, the wing will require a lower AOA in ground effect toproduce the same  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  .Ifaconstant AOA is maintained, an increase in  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  results.[Figure5-17]  

Ground effect also alters the thrust required versus velocity. Since induced drag predominates at low speeds,the reduction of induced drag duetoground effect will cause a significant reductionof thrust required (parasite plus induced drag) at low speeds. Due to the change in upwash, downwash, and wingtip vortices, there may be a change in position (installation) error of the airspeed system associated with ground effect.In the majority of cases, ground effect causes an increasein the local pressure at the static source and produces a lower indication of airspeed and altitude. Thus, an aircraft may be airborne at an indicated airspeed less than that normally required  

In orderfor ground effect to be of significant magnitude,the wing must be quite close to the ground.One of the direct results of ground effect is the variation of induced drag with wingheightabovethegroundataconstant  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  .Whenthe wingis ataheightequal toitsspan,the reduction in induced drag is only 1.4 percent. However, when the wing is at a height equal to one-fourth its span, the reduction in induced drag is 23.5 percent and, when the wing is at a height equal toone-tenthitsspan,the reduction in induced drag is 47.6 percent. Thus, a large reduction in induced drag takes place only when the wing is very close to the ground.Because of this variation, ground effect is most usually recognized during the liftoff for takeoff or just prior to touchdown when landing.  

![](images/0b28a7cfb52e57c7219dbc67b305646969ef0e22a54286628f9ae7ef2bc23f48.jpg)  
Figure5-17.Ground effect changes drag and lift  

During thetakeoff phase of flight,ground effect produces some important relationships. An aircraft leaving ground effect after takeoff encounters just the reverse of an aircraft entering ground effect during landing. The aircraft leaving groundeffectwill:  

Require an increase in AOA to maintain the same  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust required Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up changeinmoment Experience a reduction in static source pressure and increase in indicated airspeed  

Groundeffect must be considered duringtakeoffs andlandings. For example, if a pilot fails to understand the relationship between the aircraft and ground effect during takeoff, a hazardous situation is possible because the recommended takeoff speed may not be achieved.Due to the reduced drag in ground effect, the aircraft may seem capable of takeoff well below the recommended speed. As the aircraft rises out of ground effect with a deficiency of speed,the greater induced drag may result in marginal initial climb performance. In extreme conditions, such as high gross weight, high density altitude, and high temperature, a deficiency of airspeed during takeoff may permit the aircraft to become airborne but be incapable of sustaining flight out of ground effect. In this case, the aircraft may become airborne initially with a deficiency of speed and then settle back to the runway.  

A pilot should not attempt to force an aircraft to become airborne with a deficiency of speed.Themanufacturer's recommended takeoff speed is necessary to provide adequate initial climb performance.Itis alsoimportant that a definite climb be established before a pilot retracts the landing gear orflaps.Never retract the landing gear or flaps prior to establishing a positive rate of climb and only after achieving asafe altitude.  

If, during the landing phase of flight, the aircraft is brought intoground effect with aconstant AOA,the aircraft experiences an increase in  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  and a reduction in the thrust required,and a“floating”effectmayoccur.Becauseof the reduced drag and lack of power-off deceleration in ground effect, any excess speed at the point of flare may incur a considerable “float" distance. As the aircraft nears the point of touchdown,ground effectis most realized at altitudes less than the wingspan. During the final phases of the approach as the aircraft nears the ground,a reduction of power is necessary to offset the increase in lift caused from ground effect otherwisethe aircraft will have a tendency to climb above the desired glidepath (GP)  

# Axes of an Aircraft  

The axes of an aircraft are three imaginary lines that pass through an aircraft's CG. The axes can be considered as imaginary axles around which the aircraft turns.Thethree axes pass through the CG at  $90^{\circ}$  angles to each other.The axis passes through the CG and parallel to a line from nose totail isthelongitudinalaxis,theaxisthatpassesparallel to a line from wingtip to wingtip is the lateral axis, and the axis that passes through the CG at right angles to the other two axes is the vertical axis. Whenever an aircraft changes its flight attitude or position in flight,it rotates about one or more of the three axes.[Figure5-18]  

The aircraft's motion about its longitudinal axis resembles the roll of a ship from side to side.In fact, the names used to describe the motion about an aircraft'sthreeaxes were originally nautical terms.They have been adapted to aeronautical terminology due to the similarity of motion of aircraft and seagoing ships. The motion about the aircraft's longitudinal axis is"roll,"the motion about its lateral axis is  

![](images/74945dff0bb8f87f043aa81939a406296b6021f488b71b18f055835e92daefec.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.Axes of an airplane.  

‘pitch," and the motion about its vertical axis is "yaw." Yaw is theleft and right movement of the aircraft's nose.  

The three motions of the conventional airplane(roll,pitch. and yaw)are controlled by three control surfaces. Roll is controlled by the ailerons; pitch is controlled by the elevators; yawiscontrolledbytherudder.Theuseofthesecontrols is explained in Chapter 6, Flight Controls. Other types of aircraft may utilize different methods of controlling the movements about the various axes.  

Forexample,weight-shift control aircraft control two axes (roll and pitch)using an“A"frame suspended from the flexible wing attached to a three-wheeledcarriage.These aircraft are controlled by moving a horizontal bar (called a control bar) in roughly the same way hang glider pilots fly. [Figure5-19] They are termed weight-shift control aircraft because the pilot controls the aircraft by shifting the CG. For more information on weight-shift control aircraft, see the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA)Weight-Shift Control Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-5.In the case of powered parachutes,aircraft control is accomplished by altering the airfoilvia steeringlines.  

A powered parachute wingis a parachute that has a cambered upper surface and a flatter under surface. The two surfaces are separated by ribs that act as cells, which open to the airflow at the leading edge and have internal ports to allow lateral airflow.The principle at work holds that thecellpressure is greater than the outside pressure, thereby forming a wing that maintains its airfoil shape in flight. The pilot and passenger sit in tandem in front of the engine, which is located at the rear of avehicle.The airframeis attached totheparachute via two attachment points and lines. Controlis accomplished by both power and the changingof the airfoil via the control lines.[Figure5-20]

# Moment and Moment Arm  

A studyof physics shows that a body that is free to rotate will always turn about its CG. In aerodynamic terms, the mathematical measure of an aircraft's tendency to rotate about it sCG is called a“moment."Amomentissaid tobe equal tothe product of theforce applied and the distance at which the force is applied. (A moment arm is the distance from a datum [reference point or line] to the applied force.) For aircraft weight and balance computations, “moments" areexpressedintermsofthedistanceofthearmtimesthe aircraft's weight, or simply, inch-pounds.  

Aircraft designers locate the fore and aft position of the aircraft'sCG as nearly as possible to the 20 percent point of the mean aerodynamic chord(MAC).If thethrustline is designed to pass horizontally through theCG,itwillnot causetheaircrafttopitchwhenpowerischanged,andthere will be no difference in moment due to thrust for a power-on or power-off condition of flight. Although designers have some control over the location of the drag forces, they are not always able to make the resultant dragforces pass through the CG of the aircraft. However, the one item over which they have the greatest control is the size and location of the tail. The objectiveis to make the moments(due to thrust,drag, and lift) as small as possible and, by proper location of the tail, to provide the means of balancing an aircraft longitudinally for any condition of flight.  

The pilot has no direct control over the location of forces acting on the aircraft in flight,except for controlling the center of lift by changing the AOA. The pilot can control the magnitude of the forces. Such a change, however, immediately involves changes in other forces.Therefore, the pilot cannot independently change the location of one force without changing the effect of others. For example, a change in airspeed involves a change in lift, as well as a change in drag and a change in the up or down force on the tail.As forces such as turbulence and gusts act to displace the aircraft, the pilot reacts by providing opposing control forces to counteract this displacement  

Some aircraft are subject to changes in the location of the CG with variations of load. Trimming devices, such as elevator trim tabs and adjustable horizontal stabilizers, are used to counteract themoments set upbyfuel burnoff and loading or off-loading of passengers or cargo.  

# Aircraft Design Characteristics  

Each aircrafthandles somewhat differently because each resists or responds to control pressures in its ownway.For example, a training aircraft is quick to respond to control applications, while a transport aircraft feels heavy on the controls and responds to control pressures more slowly. These features can be designed into an aircraft to facilitate the particular purpose of the aircraft by considering certain stability and maneuvering requirements. The following discussion summarizes the more important aspects of an aircraft's stability, maneuverability, and controllability qualities; how they are analyzed; and their relationship to various flight conditions.  

# Stability  

Stability is the inherent quality of an aircraft to correct for conditions that may disturb its equilibrium and to return to or to continue on the original flight path.It isprimarilyan aircraft design characteristic.The flight paths and attitudes an aircraftflies are limited by the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft,its propulsion system, and its structural strength These limitations indicate the maximum performance and maneuverability of the aircraft.If the aircraft is to provide maximumutility,it must be safely controllable to the full extent of theselimits without exceeding thepilot's strength or requiring exceptional flying ability. If an aircraft is to fly straight and steady along any arbitrary flight path, the forces acting on it must be in static equilibrium.Thereactionoff anybody when its equilibrium is disturbed is referred to as stability. The two types of stability are static and dynamic.  

# StaticStability  

Static stability refers to the initial tendency,or direction of movement,back to equilibrium.In aviation,it refers to the aircraft's initial response when disturbed from a given pitch, yaw,orbank.  

Positive static stability—the initial tendency of the aircraft toreturn to the original state of equilibrium after being disturbed.[Figure5-21] Neutral static stability—the initial tendency of the aircraft to remain in a new condition after its equilibrium has been disturbed.[Figure5-21] Negative static stability—theinitial tendency of the aircraft to continue away from the original state of equilibrium after being disturbed.[Figure5-21]  

# Dynamic Stability  

Static stability has been defined as the initial tendency to return to equilibrium that the aircraft displays after being disturbed from its trimmed condition.Occasionally,the initial tendency is different or opposite from the overall tendency, so a distinction must be made between the two. Dynamic stability refers to the aircraft response over time  

![](images/7ecba11f37579c85990c42f9aedf0c9085e2f9ed2682e39ef9b4ac7ade7ffd3d.jpg)  
Figure5-21.Types of static stability  

when disturbed from a given pitch, yaw, or bank. This type of stability also has three subtypes:[Figure5-22]  

Positive dynamic stability—overtime,themotion of the displaced object decreases in amplitude and because it is positive, the object displaced returns toward the equilibrium state. Neutral dynamic stability—once displaced, the displaced object neither decreases nor increases in amplitude. A worn automobile shock absorber exhibits thistendency. Negative dynamic stability—over time, the motion of the displaced objectincreases and becomesmore divergent.  

Stability in an aircraft affects two areas significantly  

Maneuverability—the quality of an aircraft that permitsittobemaneuveredeasilyandtowithstand the stresses imposed by maneuvers.Itisgovernedby the aircraft'sweight,inertia,size and location of flight controls, structural strength, and powerplant. It too is an aircraft design characteristic. Controllability-the capability of an aircraft to respond to the pilot's control, especially with regard to flight path and attitude.It is the quality of the aircraft's response to the pilot's control application when maneuvering the aircraft,regardlessofits stability characteristics.  

# Longitudinal Stability(Pitching)  

In designing an aircraft, a great deal of effort is spent in developing the desired degree of stability around all three axes.But longitudinal stability about thelateralaxis is considered to be the most affected by certain variables in various flight conditions.  

Longitudinal stability is the quality that makes an aircraft stable about its lateral axis.It involves the pitching motion astheaircraft's nose moves up and down in flight.A longitudinally unstable aircrafthas atendency todive or climb progressively into a very steep dive or climb, or even astall.Thus,an aircraft with longitudinal instability becomes difficult and sometimes dangerous to fly  

Static longitudinal stability, or instability in an aircraft, is dependent upon three factors:  

1. Location of the wing with respect to the CG 2. Location of thehorizontal tail surfaces with respect totheCG 3.Area orsizeof thetail surfaces  

In analyzing stability, it should be recalled that a body free torotate alwaysturnsaboutitsCG.  

To obtain static longitudinal stability,the relation of the wing and tail moments must be such that, if the moments are initially balanced and the aircraft is suddenly nose up, the wing moments and tail moments change so that the sum of their forces provides an unbalanced but restoring moment which, in turn, brings the nose down again. Similarly, if the aircraft is nose down, the resulting change in moments brings thenosebackup.  

The Center of Lift(CL)inmost asymmetrical airfoilshas a tendency to change its fore and aft positions with a change in theAOA.The CL tends to move forward with an increase in AOAandtomoveaftwithadecreaseinAOA.Thismeans  

![](images/9fc9af7e26a16bc6a96eaa7e7354dff1d5001754d5c3fdecaa9d522c25fec197.jpg)  
Figure5-22.Damped versus un damped stability  

that when the AOA of an airfoil is increased, the CL,by moving forward, tends to lift the leading edge of the wing still more. This tendency gives the wing an inherent quality ofinstability.(NOTE:CLis also known as the center of pressure(CP).)  

Figure 5-23 shows an aircraft in straight-and-levelflight. The line CG-CL-T represents the aircraft's longitudinal axis from the CG to a point T on thehorizontal stabilizer.  

Most aircraft are designed so that the wing's CL is to the rear of the CG.This makes the aircraft“nose heavy”and requires thattherebe a slight downward force on thehorizontal stabilizer in order to balance the aircraft and keep the nose from continually pitching downward. Compensation for this nose heaviness is provided by setting the horizontal stabilizer at as light negative AO A.The downward force thus produced holds the tail down, counterbalancing the “heavy” nose. It is as if the line CG-CL-T were a lever with an upward force at CL and two downward forces balancing each other, one a strong force at the CG point and theother,amuchlesser force, at point T (downward air pressure on the stabilizer). To better visualize this physics principle: If an iron bar were suspended at point CL, with a heavy weight hanging on it at the CG,it would take downward pressure at point T tokeep the“lever"in balance.  

Even though thehorizontal stabilizer maybelevel when the aircraftisinlevelflight,thereis adownwashof airfromthe wings. This downwash strikes the top of the stabilizer and produces a downward pressure,which at a certain speed is just enough to balance the “lever." The faster the aircraft is flying,the greater this downwash and the greater the downward force on the horizontal stabilizer (except T-tails). [Figure5-24]In aircraft with fixed-position horizontal stabilizers,the aircraft manufacturer sets the stabilizer at an anglethat provides thebest stability (or balance) during flight at the design cruising speed and power setting.  

If the aircraft's speed decreases, the speed of the airflow over the wing is decreased.As a result of this decreased  

![](images/fa640471a3a4da83b997cf66e4af212f76b2819254d2fc3a4df14db0d137cd56.jpg)

Figure5-24.Effect of speed on down wash  

flow of air over the wing, the downwash is reduced, causing a lesser downward force on the horizontal stabilizer. In turn, the characteristic nose heaviness is accentuated,causingthe aircraft's nose to pitch down more.[Figure 5-25] This places the aircraft in a nose-low attitude, lessening the wing's AOA and drag and allowing the airspeed toincrease. As the aircraft continues in the nose-low attitude and its speed increases, the downward force on the horizontal stabilizeris once again increased. Consequently, the tail is again pushed downward and the nose risesinto a climbing attitude  

![](images/67677909c7b566c72be4e9beeb3c7c86713a7a130f580b4dee3a5edd709c8790.jpg)  
Figure5-25.Reduced power allows pitch down  

As this climb continues,the airspeed again decreases,causing the downward force on the tail to decrease until the nose lowers once more.Because the aircraft is dynamically stable the nose does not lower as far this time as it did before.The aircraft acquires enough speed in this more gradual dive to startitintoanotherclimb,buttheclimbisnotassteepas theprecedingone.  

After several of these diminishing oscillations,in which the nose alternately rises and lowers,the aircraft finally settles down to a speed at which the downward force on the tailexactlycounteractsthetendencyoftheaircrafttodive. When this condition is attained,the aircraft is once again in balanced flight and continues in stabilized flight as long as this attitude and airspeed arenot changed.  

A similar effect is noted upon closing the throttle.The down wash of the wings is reduced and the force at Tin Figure5-23 is not enough to hold the horizontal stabilizer down.It seems asif theforce at T on thelever were allowing the force of gravity to pull the nose down. This is a desirable characteristic because the aircraft isinherently trying to regain airspeed and reestablish theproper balance.  

Power or thrust can alsohave a destabilizing effect in that an increase of power may tend to make the nose rise. The aircraft designer can offset this by establishing a“high thrust line"wherein the line of thrust passes above the CG. [Figures5-26and5-27]Inthis case,aspower or thrust is

Figure5-27.Powerchanges affect longitudinal stability  

increased a moment is produced tocounteract thedownload onthetail.Ontheotherhand,avery"lowthrustline"would tend to add to the nose-up effect of the horizontal tail surface. Conclusion:withCGforwardoftheCLandwithan aerodynamictail-downforce,the aircraft usually tries to return to a safe flying attitude.  

Thefollowing is a simple demonstration of longitudinal stability. Trim the aircraft for “hands off"control in level flight. Then, momentarily give the controls a slight push to nose the aircraft down. If, within a brief period, the nose rises towards the original position, the aircraft is statically stable. Ordinarily, the nose passes the original position (that of level flight) and a series of slow pitching oscillations follows. If the oscillations gradually cease, the aircraft has positive stability; if they continue unevenly, the aircraft has neutral stability; if they increase, the aircraft is unstable  

# Lateral Stability (Rolling)  

Stability about the aircraft's longitudinal axis,which extends from the nose of the aircraft to its tail,iscalledlateral stability.Positive lateral stability helps to stabilize the lateral or“rolling effect”when one wing gets lower than the wing on the opposite sideof the aircraft.There arefour main design factors that make an aircraft laterally stable:dihedral, sweepback,keel effect,and weight distribution.  

Dihedral  

Some aircraft are designed so that the outer tips of the wings arehigher than thewingroots.Theupward anglethusformed by the wings is called dihedral.[Figure5-28/When agust causesaroll,a side slip will result.Thissideslip causes the relative wind affecting the entire airplane tobe from the direction of the slip.When the relative wind comes from the side, the wing slipping into the wind is subject to an increase in AOA and develops an increase in lift. The wing away from the wind is subject to a decrease in angle of attack, and develops a decrease in lift. The changes in lift effect a rolling moment tending to raise the windward wing, hence dihedral contributes to as table roll due to side slip.[Figure5-29]  

SweepbackandWingLocation  

Many aspects of an aircraft's configuration can affect its effective dihedral, but two major components are wing sweepback and the wing location with respect to the fuselage (such as a low wing or high wing). As a rough estimation,  $10^{\circ}$   of sweepback on a wing provides about  $1^{\circ}$  ofeffective dihedral, while a high wing configuration can provide about  $5^{\circ}$  of effective dihedral over a low wing configuration.  

A sweptback wing is one in which the leading edge slopes backward.[Figure 5-30j When a disturbance causes an aircraft with sweepback to slip or drop a wing,the low wing presents its leading edge at an angle that ismore perpendicular to the relative air flow.Asaresult,thelow wing acquires more lift,rises,and the aircraft is restored to its original flight attitude.  

# Keel Effect and Weight Distribution  

A high wing aircraft always has the tendency to turn the longitudinal axisof the aircraft into the relative wind,whichis often referred to as thekeel effect. These aircraft arelaterally stable simplybecause the wings are attached in a high position on the fuselage, making the fuselage behave like a keelexertingasteadyinginfluenceontheaircraftlaterally aboutthelongitudinalaxis.Whenahigh-wingedaircraftis

disturbed and one wing dips, the fuselage weight acts like a pendulum returning theaircraftto thehorizontal level.  

Laterally stable aircraft are constructed so that the greater portion of thekeel areais above theCG.[Figure5-31]Thus, when the aircraft slips to one side, the combination of the  

![](images/f8eff344556c4e790f89d8e806fda754320a963e1067581302bbdfd30e8ed6b4.jpg)

Figure5-31.Keel area for lateral stability  

aircraft's weight and the pressure of the airflow against the upper portion of the keel area (both acting about the CG) tends to roll the aircraft back to wings-level flight  

# Directional Stability(Yawing)  

Stability about the aircraft'sverticalaxis(thesideways moment)is called yawing or directional stability. Yawing or directional stability is the most easily achieved stability in aircraft design. The area of the vertical fin and the sides of the fuselage aft of the CG are the prime contributors that make the aircraft act like the well known weathervane or arrow,pointing its nose into therelativewind.  

In examining a weathervane,it can be seen that if exactly the same amount of surface were exposed to the wind in front of the pivot point as behind it,the forces fore and aftwould be in balance and little or no directional movement would result.Consequently,it is necessary to have agreatersurface aft of the pivot point than forward of it.  

Similarly,the aircraft designer must ensure positive directional stability by making the side surface greater aft than ahead of the CG.[Figure5-32]To provide additional positive stability to that provided by thefuselage, a vertical finisadded.Thefin actssimilar tothefeatheron anarrow in maintaining straight flight. Like the weather vane and the arrow,the far the raft this finis placed and the larger its size, thegreater the aircraft's directional stability.  

If an aircraft is flying in a straight line, and a sideward gust of air gives the aircraft as light rotation about its vertical axis (i.e., the right), the motion is retarded and stopped by the fin because while the aircraft isrotating to the right,the air is striking the left side of the fin at an angle. This causes pressure on the left side of the fin, which resists the turning motionandslowsdowntheaircraft'syaw.Indoingso,it acts somewhat like the weathervane by turning the aircraft into the relative wind.The initial change in direction of the aircraft's flight path is generally slightly behind its change of heading. Therefore, after a slight yawing of the aircraft

Figure5-32.Fuselage and fin for directional stability  

to the right,there is a brief moment when the aircraft is still moving along its originalpath,but its longitudinal axis is pointed slightly to the right.  

The aircraft is then momentarily skidding sideways and, during that moment (since it is assumed that although the yawing motion has stopped, the excess pressure on the left side of the fin still persists), there is necessarily a tendency for the aircraft to be turned partiallyback to theleft. That is, thereisamomentaryrestoringtendencycausedbythefin  

This restoring tendency is relatively slow in developing and ceases when the aircraft stops skidding.Whenitceases,the aircraft is flying in a direction slightly different from the original direction.In other words,it will not return ofits own accord to the original heading; the pilot must reestablish the initialheading  

A minor improvement of directional stability maybe obtained through sweep back.Sweep back is incorporated in the design of the wing primarily todelay the onset of compress i bil it y during high-speed flight. In lighter and slower aircraft, sweepback aids inlocating the center of pressure in the correct relationship with the CG.A longitudinally stable aircraft is built with the center of pressure aft of the CG  

Because ofstructural reasons,aircraft designers sometimes cannotattach the wings to the fuselage at the exact desired point. If they had to mount the wings toofar forward,and at right angles to the fuselage,the center of pressure would not be far enough to the rear to result in the desired amount off longitudinal stability. By building sweepback into the wings, however, the designers can move the center of pressure toward therear.The amount of sweep back and the position of the wings then place the center of pressurein the correct location  

Whenturbulence or rudder application causes the aircraft to yaw to one side,the opposite wing presents alongerleading edge perpendicular to the relative airflow.The airspeed of the forward wing increases and it acquires more drag than the back wing. The additional drag on theforward wing pulls thewingback,turningthe aircraft back to its originalpath  

The contribution of the wing to static directional stability is usuallysmall.The swept wing provides as table contribution depending on the amount of sweepback, but the contribution is relatively small when compared with other components.  

# Free Directional Oscillations (Dutch Roll)  

Dutch roll is a coupled lateral/directional oscillation that is usually dynamically stablebut is unsafein an aircraft because of the oscillatory nature. The damping of the oscillatory mode maybeweak or strong depending on theproperties of the particular aircraft.  

If the aircraft has a right wing pushed down, the positive sideslip angle corrects the wing laterally before the nose is realigned with the relative wind.As the wing corrects the position, a lateral directional oscillation can occur resulting in the nose of the aircraft making a figure eight on the horizon as a result of two oscillations(roll andyaw),which,althoughof about the same magnitude,are out of phase with each other.  

In most modern aircraft, except high-speed swept wing designs, these free directional oscillations usually die out automatically in very few cycles unless the air continues to be gusty or turbulent. Those aircraft with continuing Dutch roll tendencies are usually equipped with gyro-stabilized yaw dampers. Manufacturers try to reach a midpoint between too much and too little directional stability.Becauseitismore desirable for the aircraft to have“spiral instability"than Dutch roll tendencies, most aircraft are designed with that characteristic.  

# Spiral Instability  

Spiral instability exists when the static directional stability of the aircraftisverystrongascompared totheeffectofits dihedral in maintaining lateral equilibrium.Whenthelateral equilibrium of the aircraft is disturbed by agust of air and a side slip is introduced,the strong directional stability tends to yaw the nose into the resultant relative wind while the comparatively weak dihedrallags in restoring thelateral balance. Due to this yaw, the wing on the outside of the turning moment travels forward faster than the inside wing and, as a consequence, its lift becomes greater. This produces an over banking tendency which,if not corrected bythe pilot. results in the bank angle becoming steeper and steeper. At the same time, the strong directional stability that yaws the aircraft into the relative wind is actually forcing the nose to a lower pitch attitude.A slow downward spiral begins which, if not counteracted by the pilot, gradually increases into a steep spiral dive. Usually the rate of divergence in the spiral motion is so gradual the pilotcan control the tendency without any difficulty.  

Many aircraft are affected to some degree by this characteristic although they maybe inherently stable in all other normal parameters.This tendency explains why an aircraftcannot be flown“hands off'indefinitely  

Much research has gone into the development of control devices(wingleveler)to correct oreliminate thisinstability. The pilot must be careful in application of recovery controls during advanced stages of this spiral condition or excessive loads may be imposed on the structure. Improper recovery from spiral instability leading to in flight structural failures hasprobably contributed to more fatalities in general aviation aircraft than any other factor. Since the airspeed in the spiral condition builds up rapidly, the application of back elevator force to reduce this speed and to pull the nose up only 'tightens the turn,”increasing the load factor. The results of the prolonged uncontrolled spiral are inflight structural failure,crashing into the ground,orboth.Commonrecorded causes for pilots who get into thissituation areloss ofhorizon reference,inability to control the aircraft by reference to instruments, or a combination of both.  

# Effect of Wing Planform  

Understandingtheeffectsofdifferentwingplanforms is important when learning about wing performance and airplane flight characteristics.A planform is the shape of the wing as viewed from directly above and deals with air flow in three dimensions.Aspect ratio, taper ratio, and sweepback are factors in planform design that are very important to the overall aerodynamic characteristic of awing.[Figure5-33]  

Aspectratioistheratioofwingspantowingchord.Taper ratio can be either in planform or thickness, or both. In its simplest terms, it is a decrease from wing root to wingtip in wing chordor wingthickness.Sweepbackis therearward slant of a wing, horizontal tail, or other airfoil surface.  

There are two general means by which the designer can change the planform of a wing and both will affect the  

![](images/196301bdeb504172a551f6030b318d955842ed1642e804994f9a7b57ba486bcf.jpg)  
Figure5-33.Different types of wing plan forms  

aerodynamic characteristics of the wing.The first is to effect a changeinthe aspectratio.Aspectratiois the primary fact on in determining the three dimensional characteristics of the ordinary wing and its lift/drag ratio. An increase in aspect ratiowith constant velocitywill decrease thedrag,especially at high angles of attack,improving the performance of the wingwhen in a climbing attitude.  

A decreasein aspectratiowill give a corresponding increase indrag.Itshouldbenoted,however,that with an increase in aspect ratio there is an increase in the length of span,witha corresponding increase in the weight of the wing structure, which means the wing must be heavier to carry the same load. For this reason, part of the gain (due to a decrease in drag) is lost because of the increased weight,and a compromise in design is necessary to obtain the best results from these two conflicting conditions.  

Thesecond means of changing theplanform isby tapering (decreasing the length of chord from the root to the tip of the wing). In general,tapering causes a decrease in drag (most effective at high speeds) and an increase in lift. There is also a structural benefit due to a saving in weight of the wing.  

Most training and general aviation type airplanes are operated at high coefficients oflift, and therefore require comparatively high aspectratios.Airplanesthat aredeveloped tooperate at very high speeds demand greater aerodynamic cleanness and greaterstrength,which require low aspect ratios.Verylow aspect ratios result in high wing loadings and high stall speeds When sweepback is combined with low aspect ratio, it results in flying qualities very different from a more conventional high aspect ratio airplane configuration. Such airplanes require very precise and professional flying techniques, especially at slow speeds, while airplanes with a high aspect ratio are usually more forgiving of improper pilot techniques.  

The elliptical wing is the ideal subsonic planform since it provides for a minimum of induced drag for a given aspect ratio,though as we shall see,its stall characteristics in some respects are inferior to the rectangular wing. It is also comparatively difficult to construct.Thetapered airfoil is desirable from the standpoint of weight and stiffness,but again is not as efficient aerodynamically as the elliptical wing.In order to preserve the aerodynamic efficiency of the elliptical wing, rectangular and tapered wings are sometimes tailored through use of wing twist and variation in airfoil sections until they provide as nearly as possible the elliptical wing's lift distribution.While it is true that the elliptical wingprovides thebest coefficients of lift before reaching an incipient stall,it gives little advance warning of a complete stall, and lateral control may be difficult because of poor aileron effectiveness.  

In comparison, the rectangular wing has a tendency tostall first at the wing root and provides adequate stall warning. adequate aileron effectiveness,and is usually quite stable. It is, therefore, favored in the design of low cost, low speed airplanes.  

# Aerodynamic Forces in Flight Maneuvers  

# Forces in Turns  

If an aircraft wereviewed in straight-and-level flightfrom the front [Figure 5-34],and if theforces acting on the aircraft could be seen,lift and weight would be apparent: twoforces. If the aircraft were in a bank it would be apparent that lift did not act directly opposite to the weight, rather it now acts in the direction of thebank.Abasictruth aboutturnsis that when the aircraft banks,lift acts inward toward thecenter of theturn,perpendicular to the lateral axis as well as upward.  

Newton's First Law of Motion,theLawofInertia,statesthat an object at rest or moving in a straight line remains at rest orcontinues to move in a straight line until actedonbysome otherforce.Anaircraft,like any moving object,requires a sideward force to make it turn.In a normal turn,thisforce is supplied by banking the aircraft so that lift is exerted inward, as well as upward. The force of lift during a turn is separated into two components at right angles to each other. One component, which acts vertically and opposite to the weight (gravity), is called the “vertical component of lift." Theother,which acts horizontally toward the center of the turn, is called the "horizontal component oflift" or centripetal force. The horizontal component of lift is the force that pulls the aircraft from a straight flight pathtomakeit turn. Centrifugal force is the“equal and opposite reaction"of the aircraft to the change in direction and acts equal and opposite to the horizontal component of lift. This explains why, in a correctly executed turn, the force that turns the aircraft is not supplied by the rudder.Therudderisused tocorrect any deviation between thestraight track of the nose and tail of the aircraft into the relative wind. A good turn is one in which the  

![](images/d48e7ab26fa82eae3e70474b2d8889d62ec54cdf9af6501a34bfc32af7dca1d1.jpg)  
Figure5-34.Forces during normal,coordinated turn at constant altitude  

nose and tail of the aircraft track along the same path. If no rudder is used in a turn,the nose of the aircraft yaws to the outside of the turn. The rudder is used rolling into the turn to bring the nose back in line with the relative wind. Once in the turn, the rudder should not be needed.  

An aircraft is not steered like a boat or an automobile.In orderforanaircrafttoturn,itmustbebanked.If itisnot banked,thereisnoforceavailabletocauseittodeviate from a straight flight path. Conversely, when an aircraft is banked, it turns provided it is not slipping to the inside of the turn.Good directional control is based on the fact that the aircraft attempts to turn wheneveritis banked.Pilots should keep this fact in mind when attempting to hold the aircraft in straight-and-level flight.  

Merelybanking the aircraft into a turn produces no change in the total amount of lift developed. Since the lift during the bank is divided into vertical and horizontal components, the amount oflift opposinggravity and supporting the aircraft'sweight is reduced. Consequently, the aircraft loses altitude unless additional lift is created. This is done by increasing the AOA until the vertical component of lift is again equal to the weight. Since the vertical component of lift decreases as the bank angle increases, the AOA must be progressively increased to produce sufficient vertical lift to support the aircraft's weight.An important fact for pilots to remember when making constant altitude turns is that the vertical component of lift must be equal to the weight to maintain altitude  

At a given airspeed,the rate at which an aircraft turns depends upon the magnitude of the horizontal component oflift.It is found that the horizontal component of lift is proportional to the angle of bank—that is, it increases or decreases respectively as the angle of bank increases or decreases. As the angle of bank is increased, the horizontal component of lift increases, thereby increasing the rate of turn (ROT).Consequently,at any given airspeed,the ROT can be controlled by adjusting the angle of bank.  

To provide a vertical component of lift sufficient tohold altitude in a level turn,an increase in the AO A is required. Since the drag of the airfoil is directly proportional to its AOA, induced drag increases as the lift is increased. This, in turn, causes a loss of airspeed in proportion to the angle of bank. Asmall angleof bank results in a small reductionin airspeed while a large angle of bank results in a large reduction in airspeed.Additional thrust (power) must be applied to prevent a reductionin airspeedin level turns.The required amount of additional thrust is proportional to the angle of bank  

To compensate for added lift, which would result if the airspeed were increased during a turn, the AOA must be decreased,or the angle of bank increased,if a constant altitude is to be maintained.If the angle of bank is held constant and the AO A decreased,theROTdecreases.Inorder to maintain a constant ROT as the airspeed is increased,the AOA must remain constant and the angle of bank increased.  

Anincreasein airspeed results in anincrease of theturnradius, and centrifugal force is directly proportional to the radius of the turn.In a correctly executed turn, the horizontal component of lift must be exactly equal and opposite to the centrifugal force. As the airspeedis increased in a constant-rate level turn, theradiusoftheturnincreases.Thisincreaseintheradius of turn causes anincreaseinthe centrifugal force,whichmust be balanced by an increase in the horizontal component of lift which can only be increased by increasing the angleofbank  

In a slipping turn,the aircraft is not turning at the rate appropriate to the bank being used,since the aircraft is yawed toward theoutsideof the turning flight path.The aircraft is banked too much for the ROT,so the horizontal lift component isgreaterthanthecentrifugalforce.[Figure5-35/Equilibrium between thehorizontal lift component and centrifugal force is reestablished by either decreasing thebank,increasing the ROT,or a combination of the two changes.  

A skidding turn results from an excess of centrifugal force over the horizontal lift component,pulling the aircraft toward theoutsideof theturn.TheROT is toogreatfor the angle of bank. Correction of a skidding turn thus involves a reduction in the ROT, an increase in bank, or a combination ofthetwochanges.  

To maintain a given ROT,the angle of bank must be varied with the airspeed. This becomes particularly important in high-speed aircraft.Forinstance,at 400 miles per hour(mph), an aircraft must be banked approximately  $44^{\circ}$  toexecutea standard-rate turn(  $3^{\circ}$  per second). At this angle of bank, only about 79percentof thelift of the aircraft comprises the vertical component of the lift.This causes a loss of altitude unless the AOA is increased sufficiently to compensate for the loss of vertical lift.  

# Forces in Climbs  

For all practical purposes, the wing's lift in a steady state normal climbis the same as itis in a steadylevel flight at the same airspeed. Although the aircraft's flight path changed when the climb was established,the AO A of the wing with respect to the inclined flight path reverts to practically the same values, as does the lift. There is an initial momentary change as shown in Figure 5-36.During the transition from straight-and-level flight toa climb,a changein lift occurs when back elevator pressure is first applied. Raising the aircraft's nose increases the AO A and momentarily increases  

![](images/df1adddd67d695204d1778c1160ed05b0f1da3fc9c793aa06a364864febc13d3.jpg)  
Figure5-35.Normal,slipping,and skidding turns at a constant altitude  

the lift. Lift at this moment is now greater than weight and starts the aircraft climbing. After the flight path is stabilized on the upward incline,theAOAandlift againrevertto about the level flightvalues.  

If the climbis enteredwithno changeinpower setting,the airspeed gradually diminishes because the thrust required to maintain a given airspeed in level flight is insufficient to maintain the same airspeed in a climb. When the flight path is inclined upward, a component of the aircraft's weight acts in the same direction as, and parallel to, the total drag of the aircraft, thereby increasing the total effective drag. Consequently,the total effective drag isgreater than the power, and the airspeed decreases. The reduction in airspeed gradually results in a corresponding decrease in drag until the total drag(including the component of weight acting in the same direction)equalsthethrust.[Figure5-37]Due to momentum, the change in airspeed is gradual, varying considerably with differences in aircraft size, weight, total drag, and other factors. Consequently, the total effective drag is greater than the thrust, and the airspeed decreases.  

Generally, the forces of thrust and drag, and lift and weight. again become balanced when the airspeed stabilizes but at  

![](images/24fd2d39f6fc1e7f789a714a83bf47774b7f61e0306ef00566d0055086b44f99.jpg)  
Figure5-36.Changes in lift during climb entry  

a value lower than in straight-and-level flight at the same power setting.Since the aircraft'sweight is actingnot only downward but rearward with drag while in a climb, additional powerisrequired tomaintain thesame airspeed asinlevel flight.The amount of power dependson the angleof climb. When the climb is established steep enough that there is insufficient power available, a slower speed results.  

The thrust required for a stabilized climb equals drag plus a percentage of weight dependent on the angle of climb.For example,a  $10^{\circ}$  climbwould require thrust to equal dragplus 17 percent of weight. To climb straight up would require thrust to equal all of weight and drag. Therefore, the angle of climb for climb performance is dependent on the amount of excess thrust available to overcome a portion of weight Note that aircraft are able to sustain a climb due to excess thrust.When the excess thrust is gone, the aircraft is no longer able to climb. At this point, the aircraft has reached its “absolute ceiling.'  

# Forces in Descents  

As in climbs, the forces that act on the aircraft go through definite changes when a descent is entered from straight and-levelflight.For the following example,the aircraft  

![](images/36e7003be1f79cbb89a72cb31def2007de127d9c9dda43ba153723f4a9781051.jpg)  
Figure 5-37.Changesin speed during climb entry  

is descending at the same power as used in straight-and levelflight.  

As forward pressureis applied tothecontrol yoketoinitiate the descent, the AOA is decreased momentarily. Initially. the momentum of the aircraft causes the aircraft to briefly continue along the same flight path.For this instant, the AOA decreases causing the totallift to decrease.With weight now beinggreater than lift, the aircraft begins to descend.At the same time, the flight path goes from level to a descending flight path. Do not confuse a reduction in lift with the inability togenerate sufficient lift to maintain level flight. The flight path is being manipulated with available thrust in reserve and with the elevator.  

To descend at the same airspeed as used in straight-and- levelflight,the power must be reduced as the descent is entered.Entering the descent,the component of weight acting forward along the flight path increases as the angle of descent increases and,conversely,whenlevelingoff,the component of weight acting along the flight path decreases as the angle of descent decreases.  

# Stalls  

An aircraftstall resultsfrom arapid decreaseinliftcaused by theseparationof airflowfrom thewing's surface broughton by exceeding the critical AO A.As tall can occur at any pitch attitudeorairspeed.Stallsareoneofthemostmisunderstood areasof aerodynamics because pilots oftenbelieve an airfoil stops producing lift when it stalls. In a stall, the wing does not totally stop producing lift. Rather, it cannot generate adequatelift to sustain level flight  

Sincethe  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  increases with an increase in AOA,at some pointthe  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  peaks and then begins to drop off. This peak is called the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  . The amount of lift the wing produces drops dramatically after exceeding the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  or critical AOA, but as stated above, it does not completely stop producing lift  

In most straight-wing aircraft, the wing is designed to stall the wing root first. The wing root reaches its critical AOA first making the stall progress outward toward the wingtip. Byhaving the wing roots tall first,aileron effectiveness is maintained at the wingtips, maintaining controllability of the aircraft.Various design methods are used to achieve the stalling of the wing root first. In one design, the wing is “"twisted" to a higher AOA at the wing root. Installing stall strips on the first 20-25 percent of the wing'sleadingedge is another method to introduce a stall prematurely  

The wing never completely stops producing lift in a stalled condition.Ifit did,the aircraft would fall to theEarth.Most training aircraft are designed for the nose of the aircraft to drop during a stall, reducing the AOA and“unstalling” the wing. The nose-down tendency is due to the CL being aft of the CG. The CG range is very important when it comes to stall recovery characteristics.If an aircraft is allowed to be operated outside of the CG range, the pilot mayhave difficulty recovering from as tall.The most critical CG violation would occur when operating with a CG thatexceeds the rear limit. In this situation, a pilot may not be able to generate sufficient force with the elevator to counteract the excess weight aft of theCG.Without the ability to decrease the AO A,theaircraft continues in a stalled condition until it contacts the ground  

The stalling speed of a particular aircraft is not a fixed value for all flight situations, but a given aircraft always stalls at the same AOA regardless of airspeed,weight,loadfactor, or densityaltitude.Each aircraft has a particular AO A where the airflow separates from the upper surface of the wing and the stall occurs. This critical AOA varies from approximately  $16^{\circ}$  to  $20^{\circ}$  depending on the aircraft's design. But each aircraft has only one specific AO A where the stall occurs.  

There are three flight situations in which the critical AOA is most frequently exceeded: low speed, high speed, and turning  

One way the aircraft can be stalled in straight-and-levelflight by flying too slowly.As the airspeed decreases, the AOA must be increased to retain the lift required for maintaining altitude.The lower the airspeed becomes,themoretheAOA must be increased.Eventually, an AOA is reached that results in the wing not producing enough lift to support the aircraft, which then starts settling.If the airspeed is reduced further, theaircraftstallsbecausetheAOAhasexceededthecritical angle and the airflow over the wing is disrupted.  

Lowspeed is not necessary to produce a stall.Thewing can be brought into an excessive AOA at any speed. For example, an aircraft is in a dive with an airspeed of 100 knots when the pilot pullsback sharply on theelevator control.[Figure5-38/Gravity and centrifugal force prevent an immediate alteration of theflightpath,buttheaircraft's AOA changes abruptlyfrom quite low toveryhigh.Since the flight path of the aircraft in relation to the oncoming air determines the direction of the relative wind,theAOAis suddenly increased, and the aircraft would reach the stalling angle at a speed much greater than the normal stall speed.  

The stalling speed of an aircraft is also higher in a level turn thaninstraight-and-levelflight.[Figure5-39/Centrifugal force is added to the aircraft's weight and the wing must produce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance the load imposed by the combination of centrifugal force and weight In a turn, the necessary additional lift is acquired by applying back pressure to the elevator control.This increases the wing's  

![](images/64eafdaaf5f52f9d7163837e847532fb667976d5c726dc701cfcf7c0602be9e3.jpg)  
Figure5-38.Forcesexertedwhenpullingoutofadive.  

AOA and results in increased lift.The AOA must increase as the bank angle increases to counteract the increasing load caused by centrifugal force. If at any time during a turn the AO A becomes excessive,the aircraft stalls  

At this point, the action of the aircraft during a stall should be examined. To balance the aircraft aerodynamically, the CL is normally located aft of the CG. Although this makes the aircraft inherently nose-heavy,downwash on thehorizontal stabilizer counteracts this condition.At the point of stall, when the upward force of thewing's lift diminishes below thatrequiredfor sustainedflight and the downwardtail force decreases to a point of ineffectiveness, or causes it to have an upward force, an unbalanced condition exists. This causes the aircraft to pitch down abruptly,rotating about its CG.Duringthisnose-down attitude,theAOAdecreases and the airspeed again increases.The smooth flowof air over the wing begins again, lift returns, and the aircraft begins to fly again.Considerable altitude may be lost before this cycleiscomplete.  

![](images/581885c74eef8b4c7c05854080ea017a42014746fb38b667b0e9ddea0a8dec8d.jpg)  
Figure5-39.Increase install speed and load factor  

Airfoil shape and degradation of that shape must also be considered in a discussion of stalls. For example, ifice, snow, and frost are allowed to accumulate on the surface of an aircraft, the smooth airflow over the wing is disrupted. This causes the boundarylayer toseparate at anAOA lower than thatof the critical angle. Lift is greatly reduced, altering expected aircraft performance. If ice is allowed to accumulate on the aircraft duringflight,theweightof the aircraft is increased while the ability to generate lift is decreased.[Figure5-40]Aslittleas 0.8 millimeter of ice on the upper wing surface increases drag and reduces aircraft lift by 25 percent.  

Pilots can encounter icing in any season, anywhere in the country,at altitudes of up to18,0oofeet and sometimes higher.Smallaircraft,including commuter planes,aremost vulnerable because they fly at lower altitudes where ice is more prevalent.They also lack mechanisms common on jet aircraft that prevent ice buildup by heating the front edges of wings  

Icing can occur in clouds any time the temperature drops below freezing and super-cooled droplets build up on an aircraft and freeze. (Super-cooled droplets are still liquid even though the temperature is below 32 °Fahrenheit (F), Oor  $0~^{\circ}$  Celsius (C).  

# Angle of Attack Indicators  

The FAA along with the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC)is promoting AOA indicators as one of the many safety initiatives aimed at reducing thegeneral aviation accidentrate.AOAindicators will specifically target Loss of Control (LOC) accidents. Loss of control is the number one root cause of fatalities in both general aviation and commercial aviation. More than 25 percent of general aviation fatal accidents occur during the maneuvering phase of flight. Of those accidents,half involve stall/spin scenarios. Technology such a sAO A indicators can have a tremendous impact on reversing this trend and are increasingly affordable forgeneral aviation airplanes.[Figure5-41]  

The purpose of an AOA indicator is to give the pilot better situation awareness pertaining to the aerodynamic health  

![](images/45669f6a6f60f3f428222e7aae1a00a3da1abdcc2a8685204463e3d9d387e5ec.jpg)  
Figure5-4o.Inflighticeformation  

of the airfoil.This can also be referred to as stall margir awareness.More simply explained,itis the margin that exists between the current AO A that the airfoilis operatingat,and the AOA at which the airfoil will stall (critical AOA).  

Angle of attack is taught to student pilots as theory in ground training. When beginning flight training, students typically rely solely on airspeed and the published1G stallspeed to avoid stalls. This creates problems since this speed is only valid when the following conditions aremet:  

Unaccelerated flight (a 1G load factor) Coordinated flight (inclinometer centered) At one weight (typically maximum gross weight)  

Speed by itself is not a reliable parameter to avoid astall. An airplane can stall at any speed.Angle of attack is a better parameter to use to avoid a stall. For a given configuration, the airplane always stalls at the sameAOA,referredto as thecriticalAOA.This critical AO A does not change with:  

Weight Bank angle Temperature Density altitude Center of gravity  

A nAO A indicator can have several benefits when installed in general aviation aircraft,not the least of whichis increased situational awareness.Without a nAO A indicator,theAOA is“invisible"topilots.Thesedevicesmeasureseveral parameters simultaneously and determine the current AOA providing avisualimageto thepilotof thecurrentAOA along with representations of the proximity to the criticalAOA. [Figure5-42]These devices can give a visual representation of the energy management state of the airplane. The energy state of an airplane is the balance between airspeed,altitude drag,and thrust and represent show efficiently the airfoil is operating. The more efficiently the airfoil operates; the larger stall margin that is present.With this increased situational awareness pertaining to the energy condition of the airplane, pilots will have information that they need to aid in preventing a LOC scenario resulting from a stall/spin. Additionally, the less energy that is utilized to maintain flight means greater overall efficiency of the airplane, which is typically realized in fuel savings.This equates to a lower operating cost to the pilot  

Just as training is required for any system on an aircraft. AOA indicators have training considerations also.A more comprehensive understanding of AO A in general should be the goal of this training along with the specific operating characteristics and limitations of the installed AO A indicator. Ground and flight instructors should make every attempt to receive training from an instructor knowledgeable about AOA indicators prior to giving instruction pertaining to or in airplanes equipped withAOA indicators.Pilotschools should incorporate training on AOAindicators in their syllabi, whether their training aircraft are equipped with them or not.  

Installation of AOA indicators not required by type certification in general aviation airplanes has recently been streamlined by the FAA.The FAA established policy in February 2014 pertaining to non-required AOA systems and how they may be installed as a minor alteration, depending upon their installation requirements and operational utilization,and the procedures to take for certification of these installations.For updated information,referencethe FAAwebsiteatwww.faa.gov.  

While AO A indicators provide a simple visual representation of the current AO A and its proximity to the critical AO A,they are not without their limitations.These limitations should beunderstoodbyoperatorsofgeneralaviationairplanes

# Basic Propeller Principles  

The aircraft propeller consists of two or more blades and a central hub to which the blades are attached. Each blade of an aircraft propeller is essentially a rotatingwing.As a result of their construction,the propeller blades arelike airfoils and produce forces that create the thrust to pull,or push, the aircraft through the air.The engine furnishes the power needed torotate the propeller blades throughthe air athigh speeds,and the propeller transforms the rotary power of the engine intoforward thrust.  

Across-sectionofa typical propeller blade is shown in Figure5-43.This section or blade element is an airfoil comparable to across-section of an aircraftwing.One surface of the blade is cambered or curved,similartothe upper surface of an aircraft wing, while the other surface is flat like the bottom surface of a wing. The chord line is an imaginary line drawn through the blade from its leading edge to its trailing edge. As in a wing, the leading edge is the thick edge of the blade that meets the air as the propeller rotates. Blade angle, usually measured in degrees, is the angle between the chord of the blade and the plane of rotation and is measured at a specific point along the length of the blade. [Figure 5-44] Because most propellers have a flat blade“face,”the chord line is often drawn along the face of the propeller blade. Pitch is not blade angle, but because pitch is largely determined by blade angle,the two terms are

often used interchangeably.An increase or decrease in one is usually associated with an increase or decrease in the other. The pitch of a propeller may be designated in inches. A propellerdesignatedasa  $^{\circ74-48^{\circ}}$  would be 74 inches in length and have an effective pitch of 48 inches. The pitch is the distance in inches, which the propeller would screw through the airin onerevolutionif there were no slippage.  

When specifying a fixed-pitch propeller for a new type of aircraft,the manufacturer usually selects one with a pitch that operates efficiently at the expected cruisingspeed of the aircraft. Every fixed-pitch propeller must be a compromise because it can be efficient at only a given combination of airspeed and revolutions per minute(rpm).Pilots cannot change this combinationin flight  

When the aircraft is at reston the ground with the engine operating, or moving slowly at the beginning of takeoff, thepropeller efficiency is very low because thepropeller is restrained from advancing with sufficient speed to permit itsfixed-pitch blades to reach their full efficiency.Inthis situation, each propeller blade is turning through the air at a nAO A that produces relatively little thrust for the amount of power required to turn it.  

Tounderstand the action of a propeller,consider first its motion, which is both rotational and forward. As shown by  

![](images/9b26f1d22d714b76d8f46e4335bfe825718a052e71ac2023795ad96a02f6d271.jpg)  
Figure5-44.Propeller blade angle  

the vectors of propeller forces in Figure 5-44,eachsectionof a propeller blade moves downward and forward.The angle atwhichthisair(relativewind)strikes the propeller blade is its AOA.The air deflection produced by this angle causes the dynamic pressure at the engine side of the propellerblade to be greater than atmospheric pressure, thus creating thrust.  

Theshapeofthebladealsocreatesthrustbecauseitis cambered like the airfoil shape of awing.Astheairflows past the propeller, the pressure on one side is less than that on the other. As in a wing, a reaction force is produced in the direction of the lesser pressure. The airflow over the wing has less pressure, and the force (lift)is upward.In the case of the propeller, which is mounted in a vertical instead of a horizontal plane, the area of decreased pressure is in front of the propeller, and the force (thrust) is in a forward direction. Aerodynamically, thrust is the result of the propeller shape and the AO A of the blade.  

Thrust can be considered also in terms of the mass of air handled by the propeller. In these terms, thrust equals mass of air handled multiplied by slip stream velocity minus velocity of the aircraft. The power expended in producing thrust depends on the rate of air mass movement. On average, thrust constitutes approximately 80 percent of the torque (total horsepower absorbed by the propeller). The other 20 percent is lost in friction and slippage. For any speed of rotation, the horsepower absorbed by the propeller balances the horsepower delivered by the engine. For any single revolution of the propeller, the amount of air handled depends on the blade angle,which determines how big a“bite’”of air the propeller takes. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent means of adjusting the load on the propeller to control the engine rpm.  

The blade angle is also an excellent method of adjusting the AOA of the propeller. On constant-speed propellers, the blade angle must be adjusted to provide the most efficient AO A at all engine and aircraft speeds. Lift versus drag curves, which are drawn for propellers as well as wings,indicate that the most efficient AOA is small, varying from  $+2^{\circ}$  to  $+4^{\circ}$  .The actualbladeanglenecessarytomaintainthissmallAOA varies with the forward speed of the aircraft.  

Fixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers are designed for best efficiency at one rotation and forward speed. They are designed for a given aircraft and engine combination. A propeller may be used that provides the maximum efficiency for takeoff, climb, cruise, or high-speed flight. Any change in these conditions results inlowering the efficiency of both the propeller and the engine. Since the efficiency of any machine is the ratio of the useful power output to the actual power input, propeller efficiency is the ratio of thrust horsepower to brake horsepower. Propeller efficiency varies from 50 to 87 percent, depending on how much the propeller “slips." Propellerslipis the difference between the geometric pitch of the propeller and its effective pitch.[Figure5-45]Geometric pitch is the theoretical distance a propeller should advance in one revolution; effective pitch is the distance it actually advances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is based on no slippage, but actual or effective pitch includes propeller slippageinthe air.  

The reason a propeller is"twisted"is that the outer parts of the propeller blades, like all things that turn about a central point, travelfaster than the portions near thehub. [Figure 5-46/If the blades had the same geometric pitch throughout their lengths, portions near the hub could have negative AOAs while the propeller tips would be stalled at cruise speed. Twisting or variations in the geometric pitch of the blades permits the propeller to operate with a relatively constant AOA along its length when in cruising flight. Propeller blades are twisted to change the blade angle in proportion to the differences in speed of rotation along the length of the propeller, keeping thrust more nearly equalized alongthislength  

Usually  $1^{\circ}$  to  $4^{\circ}$  provides the most efficient lift/drag ratio but in flight the propeller AOA of a fixed-pitch propeller varies normally from  $0^{\circ}$  to  $15^{\circ}$  .This variation is caused by changes in the relative airstream, which in turn results from changes in aircraft speed. Thus, propeller AOA is the product of two motions:propeller rotation aboutitsaxisand its forward motion.  

A constant-speed propeller automatically keeps the blade angle adjusted for maximum efficiency for most conditions encountered in flight.Duringtakeoff,when maximum power and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller is at a low propeller blade angle or pitch. The low blade angle keeps the AOA small and efficient with respectto the relativewind. At the same time, it allows the propeller to handle a smaller massof air per revolution.Thislightload allows theengineto turn at high rpm and to convert the maximum amount of fuel intoheat energy in a given time. The high rpm also creates maximum thrust because,although the mass of airhandled per revolution is small,therpm and slip stream velocity are

Figure5-46.Propeller tips travel faster than thehub  

high, and with the low aircraft speed, there is maximum thrust. After liftoff, as the speed of the aircraft increases, the constant- speedpropeller automatically changes to a higher angle(or pitch). Again, the higher blade angle keeps the AOA small and efficient with respect to the relative wind. The higher bladeangleincreasesthemassof airhandledperrevolution This decreases the engine rpm, reducing fuel consumption and engine wear, and keeps thrust at a maximum.  

After the takeoff climbis establishedin an aircraft having a controllable-pitch propeller, the pilot reduces the poweroutput of the engine toclimbpower by first decreasing themanifold pressure and then increasing the blade angle to lower the rpm  

At cruising altitude,when the aircraft is inlevel flight and less power is required than is used in takeoff or climb, the pilot again reduces engine power by reducing the manifold pressure and then increasing the blade angle to decrease the rpm. Again, this provides a torque requirement to match the reduced engine power. Although the mass of air handled per revolutionis greater,it ismore than offsetby a decrease in slipstream velocity and an increase in airspeed. The AOA is still small because the blade angle has been increased with anincrease in airspeed.  

# TorqueandP-Factor  

Tothe pilot,“torque"(theleft turning tendencyof the airplane)is made up of four elements that cause or produce a twisting or rotating motion around at least one of the airplane'sthreeaxes.These four elements are:  

1. Torque reaction from engine and propeller  

2. Corkscrewing effect of the slipstream 3. Gyroscopic action of the propeller 4.  Asymmetric loading of the propeller (P-factor)  

# Torque Reaction  

Torque reaction involves Newton'sThird Lawof Physics for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As applied tothe aircraft,this means that as theinternal engine parts and propeller are revolving in one direction, an equal force is trying to rotate the aircraft in the opposite direction. [Figure5-47]  

When the aircraft is airborne, this force is acting around the longitudinal axis,tending tomake the aircraft roll. To compensate for roll tendency,someof theolder aircraftare riggedin a manner to create more lift on thewing thatisbeing forced downward. The more modern aircraft are designed with the engine offset to counteract this effect of torque.  

NOTE:Most United States built aircraft engines rotate the propeller clockwise, as viewed from the pilot's seat. The discussion here is with reference to those engines.  

Generally,the compensating factors are permanently set so that they compensate for this force at cruising speed, since most of the aircraft's operating timeis at thatspeed.However, aileron trim tabs permit further adjustment for other speeds. When the aircraft's wheels are on the ground during the takeoff roll, an additional turning moment around the vertical axis is induced by torque reaction.As the left side of the aircraft is being forced down by torque reaction, more weight is being placed on the left main landing gear. This results in more ground friction, or drag, on the left tire than on the right causing a further turning moment to the left. The magnitude of this moment is dependent on many variables. Some of these variables are:  

1. Size and horsepower of engine 2. Sizeofpropeller and therpm 3. Sizeof the aircraft 4. Conditionof the ground surface  

![](images/c84294845f7cd729a2e2774370443ac4bb25a42eefaf9bcfcafb2449400a9c0b.jpg)  
Figure5-47.Torquereaction  

This yawing moment on the takeoff roll is corrected by the pilot's proper use of the rudder or rudder trim.  

# Corkscrew Effect  

Thehigh-speed rotationof an aircraft propeller gives a corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slipstream.At high propeller speeds andlowforward speed(asin the takeoffs and approaches to power-on stalls),this spiraling rotation is very compact and exerts a strong side ward force on the aircraft's vertical tail surface.[Figure5-48]  

When this spiraling slip stream strikes the vertical fin,it causes a yawing moment about the aircraft's vertical axis. The more compact the spiral, the more prominent this force is.As the forward speed increases, however, the spiral elongates and becomes less effective.The corkscrew flowof the slip stream also causes a rolling moment aroundthelongitudinalaxis.  

Note that this rollingmoment caused by the corkscrewflow of the slip stream is to the right,while the yawing moment caused by torque reaction is to the left—in effect one may be counteracting the other. However, these forces vary greatly and it is the pilot's responsibility to apply proper corrective action by use of the flight controls at all times. These forces must be counteracted regardless of which is the most prominent at the time.  

# Gyroscopic Action  

Beforethegyroscopiceffectsofthepropellercanbe understood,it is necessary to understand the basic principle ofagyroscope.Allpracticalapplicationsof thegyroscope are based upon two fundamental properties of gyroscopic action:rigidity in space and precession.The one of interest for this discussion is precession  

Precession is the resultant action, or deflection, of a spinning rotor when a deflecting force is applied to its rim.As can be seen in Figure 5-49, when a force is applied, the resulting force takes effect  $90^{\circ}$  ahead of and in the direction of rotation. The rotating propeller of an airplane makes a very good  

![](images/06bc4448bf907a764ec42c156fab3ddabf14c7bb8c83837d583ef0e30d2b006d.jpg)

Figure5-49.Gyroscopic precession  

gyroscope and thus has similar properties.Anytimeaforce is applied to deflect the propeller out of its plane of rotation, the resulting force is  $90°$  ahead of and in the direction of rotation and in the direction of application, causing a pitching moment, a yawing moment, or a combination of the two depending upon the point at which the force was applied.  

This element oftorque effect has alwaysbeen associated with and considered more prominent in tailwheel-type aircraft and most often occurs when the tail is being raised during the takeoff roll. [Figure 5-50] This change in pitch attitude has the same effect as applying aforceto the topof the propeller's plane of rotation.The resultant force acting  $90^{\circ}$  aheadcauses a yawing moment to the left around thevertical axis. The magnitude of this moment depends on several variables, one of which is the abruptness with which the tail is raised (amount of force applied). However, precession, or gyroscopic action, occurs when a force is applied to any point on the rim of the propeller's plane of rotation;the resultant force will still be  $90°$  from the point of application in the direction of rotation.Depending on where theforce is applied, the airplane is caused to yaw left or right, to pitch up or down, or a combination of pitching and yawing.  

It can be said that, as a result of gyroscopic action, any yawing around the vertical axis results in a pitching moment, and any pitching around the lateral axis results in a yawing moment. To correct for the effect of gyroscopic action,it is necessary for the pilot toproperlyuse elevator and rudder toprevent undesired pitching andyawing

Figure5-5o.Raising tail produces gyroscopic precession.  

# Asymmetric Loading (P-Factor)  

When an aircraft is flying with a high AOA, the “bite” of the downward moving blade is greater than the"bite”of the upwardmovingblade.Thismovesthecenterofthrusttothe right of the prop disc area, causing a yawing moment toward the left around the vertical axis.Proving this explanation is complex because it would be necessary to work wind v ecton problems on each blade while considering both the AO A of the aircraft and the AO A of each blade  

This asymmetric loading is caused by the resultant velocity, which is generated by thecombination of thevelocityof the propeller blade in its plane of rotation and thevelocity of the air passing horizontally through the propeller disc.With the aircraft being flown at positive AOAs, the right (viewed from the rear) or downswinging blade, is passing through an area of resultant velocity,which is greater than that affecting the left or upswinging blade. Since the propeller blade is an airfoil, increased velocity means increased lift. The downswinging blade has more lift and tends to pull (yaw) the aircraft's nose totheleft.  

When the aircraft is flying at a high AOA, the downward movingbladehas a higher resultant velocity,creatingmore lift than the upward moving blade. [Figure 5-51]This might be easier tovisualize if the propeller shaft was mounted perpendicular to the ground (like a helicopter). If there were no air movement at all, except that generated by the propeller itself, identical sections of each blade would have the same airspeed.With air moving horizontally across this vertically mounted propeller, the blade proceeding forward into the flow of air has a higher airspeed than the blade retreating with the airflow. Thus, the blade proceeding into the horizontal airflow is creating more lift, or thrust, moving thecenter of thrusttoward thatblade.Visualize rotating the vertically mounted propeller shaft to shallower angles relative to the moving air(as on an aircraft). This unbalanced thrust then becomes proportionately smaller and continues getting smaller until it reaches the value of zero when the propeller shaft is exactly horizontal in relation to themoving air.  

The effects of each of these four elements of torque vary in value with changes in flight situations. In one phase of flight, one of these elements may be more prominent than another.In another phase of flight,another element maybe moreprominent.The relationship of these values to each other varies with different aircraft depending on the airframe, engine, and propeller combinations, as well as other design features. To maintain positive control of the aircraft in all flight conditions, the pilot must apply the flight controls as necessarytocompensateforthesevaryingvalues.

Figure5-51.Asymmetrical loading of propeller(P-factor)  

# Load Factors  

Inaerodynamics,the maximum load factor(at givenbank angle) is a proportion between lift and weight and has a trigonometric relationship.Theloadfactor is measured in Gs (acceleration of gravity), a unit of force equal to the force exerted by gravity on a body at rest and indicates theforce to which a body is subjected when it is accelerated.Anyforce applied to an aircraft to deflect its flight from a straight line produces a stress onitsstructure.The amountof thisforce is theloadfactor.While a course in aerodynamics is not a prerequisite for obtaining a pilot's license, the competent pilot should have a solid understanding of theforces that act ontheaircraft,the advantageous use of these forces,andthe operating limitations of the aircraft being flown.  

For example, a load factor of 3 means the total load on an aircraft's structure is three times its weight. Sinceload factors are expressed in terms of Gs, a load factor of 3 may be spoken ofas  $3\;\mathrm{GS}$  ,or a load factor of 4 as 4 Gs.  

If an aircraft is pulled upfrom a dive,subjectingthe pilot to 3 Gs, he or she would be pressed down into the seat with a force equal to three times his or her weight.Sincemodern aircraft operate at significantly higher speeds than older aircraft,increasing the potential for large load factors,this effect has become a primary consideration in the design of the structure of all aircraft.  

With the structural design of aircraft planned to withstand only a certain amount of overload,a knowledge of load factors has become essential for all pilots. Load factors are important for two reasons:  

1。 It is possiblefor a pilot to impose a dangerous overload ontheaircraftstructures. 2. An increased load factor increases the stalling speed and makes stalls possible atseemingly safeflight speeds.  

# Load Factors in Aircraft Design  

The answer to the questionHow strong should an aircraft be? is determined largely by the use to which the aircraft is subjected. This is a difficult problem because the maximum possible loads are much too high for use in efficient design. It is true that any pilot can make a very hard landing or an extremely sharp pull up from a dive, which would result in abnormal loads. However, such extremely abnormal loads must be dismissed somewhat if aircraft are built that takeoff quickly,land slowly, and carry worthwhile payloads.  

The problem ofloadfactors in aircraft designbecomes how to determine the highest load factors that can be expected in normal operation under various operational situations.These load factors are called“limit load factors.For reasons of safety,itisrequired thatthe aircraft be designed to withstand theseloadfactorswithout anystructural damage.Although the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) requires the aircraft structure be capable of supporting one and one-halftimes these limit load factors without failure,it is accepted that parts of the aircraft maybend or twist under theseloads and that some structural damage may occur.  

This 1.5 load limit factor is called the “factor of safety” and provides,to some extent,forloads higher than those expected undernormal and reasonable operation.Thisstrength reserve is not something that pilots should willfully abuse; rather, it is there for protection when encountering unexpected conditions.  

The above considerations apply to all loading conditions, whether they be due to gusts, maneuvers, or landings. The gust loadfactor requirements nowin effect are substantially the same as those that have been in existence for years. Hundreds of thousands of operational hourshave proven them adequate for safety. Since the pilot has little control over gust load factors (except to reduce the aircraft's speed when rough air is encountered),the gust loading requirements are substantially the same for most general aviation type aircraft regardless of their operational use. Generally, the gust load factors control the design of aircraft which are intended for strictly non acrobatic usage.  

An entirely different situation exists in aircraft design with maneuveringloadfactors.Itisnecessarytodiscussthismatter separately with respect to:(1) aircraft designed in accordance with the category system (i.e., normal, utility, acrobatic); and (2)older designs built according to requirements that did not provide for operational categories.  

Aircraft designed under the category system are readily identified by a placard in the flight deck, which states the operational category (or categories) in which the aircraft is certificated. The maximum safe load factors (limit load factors)specifiedfor aircraft in the various categories are  

![](images/c4603058c0782e3e749178172470e875449ea9b3161949e80f536db10575b166.jpg)  

1 For aircraft with gross weight of more than 4,000 pounds. the limit load factor is reduced. To the limit loads given above,a safety factor of 50 percent is added.  

There is an upward graduation in load factor with the increasing severity of maneuvers.The category system provides for maximum utility of an aircraft.Ifnormal operation alone is intended, the required load factor (and consequently the weight of the aircraft)is less than if the aircraft is tobe employed in training or acrobatic maneuvers as theyresult in higher maneuvering loads.  

Aircraft that do not have the category placard are designs that were constructed under earlier engineering requirements in which no operational restrictions were specifically given to the pilots. For aircraft of this type (up to weights of about 4,000 pounds), the required strength is comparable to present- day utility category aircraft, and the same types of operation are permissible. For aircraft of this type over 4,000 pounds. theload factors decrease with weight. These aircraft should be regarded as being comparable to the normal category aircraft designed under the category system, and they should beoperated accordingly  

# Load Factors inSteepTurns  

At a constant altitude,during a coordinated turn in any aircraft,theloadfactoris the result of twoforces:centrifugal force andweight.[Figure5-52]For anygivenbank angle the ROT varies with the airspeed—the higher the speed, the  

![](images/568c751a2d216994dbabcbc785166626a3411e2d428701c3991e358c19d46d8d.jpg)  
Figure5-52.Two forces cause load factor during turns.  

slower the ROT. This compensates for added centrifugal force,allowing the load factor to remain the same.  

Figure5-53 reveals an important fact aboutturns-theload factor increases at a terrific rate after a bank has reached  $45^{\circ}$  or  $50^{\circ}$  . The load factor for any aircraft in a coordinated level turn at  $60^{\circ}$  bank is  $2\,\mathrm{GS}.$   The load factor in an  $80^{\circ}$  bank is  $5.76\;\mathrm{GS}.$  . The wing must produce lift equal to these load factors if altitude is to be maintained.  

It shouldbenoted howrapidly theline denoting load factor rises as it approaches the  $90^{\circ}$  bankline, which it never quite reachesbecausea  $90^{\circ}$  banked,constant altitude turn is not mathematically possible. An aircraft may be banked to  $90^{\circ}$  in a coordinated turn if not trying to hold altitude. An aircraft that can be held in a  $90^{\circ}$  banked slipping turn is capable of straight knife-edged flight. At slightly more than  $80^{\circ}$  the loadfactorexceedsthelimitof  $6\,\mathrm{{GS}}$  ,the limit load factor of anacrobaticaircraft.  

For a coordinated, constant altitude turn, the approximate maximum bankfor the average general aviation aircraft is  $60^{\circ}$  This bank and its resultant necessary power setting reach the limit of this type of aircraft.An additional  $10^{\circ}$  bankincreases theloadfactor by approximately  $1\;\mathrm{G}.$  bringing it closeto the yield point established for these aircraft.[Figure5-54]  

# Load Factors and StallingSpeeds  

Any aircraft,within thelimits ofits structure,maybestalled at any airspeed.When a sufficiently high AO A is imposed. the smooth flow of air over an airfoil breaksup and separates, producing an abrupt change of flight characteristics and a sudden loss of lift, which results in a stall.  

A study of this effect has revealed that an aircraft's stalling speed increases in proportion to the square root of the  

![](images/0f3945d54e8a19433e0d9850758ec24ac53b4728defdf56675b82d9d88e808a8.jpg)  
Figure5-53.Angleofbankchangesloadfactorinlevelflight  

loadfactor.This means that an aircraft with a normal un accelerated stalling speed of 50 knots can be stalled at100 knots byinducing a load factor of 4 Gs.If it werepossible for this aircraft to withstand a load factor of nine,itcould be stalled at a speed of 150 knots.A pilot should be aware ofthefollowing:  

The danger of inadvertently stalling the aircraft by increasing the load factor, as in a steep turn or spiral; When intentionally stalling an aircraft above its design maneuvering speed, a tremendousload factor isimposed.  

Figures5-53and5-54 show that banking an aircraftgreater than  $72^{\circ}$  in a steep turn produces a load factor of 3, and the stalling speed is increased significantly.If this turn is made in an aircraft with a normal unaccelerated stalling speed of 45 knots, the airspeed must be kept greater than 75 knots to prevent inducing a stall. A similar effect is experienced in a quick pull up or any maneuver producing load factors above 1 G. This sudden, unexpected loss of control, particularly in a steep turn or abrupt application of the back elevator control neartheground,has caused many accidents.  

Since theload factor is squared as the stalling speed doubles, tremendous loads maybe imposed on structures by stalling an aircraft at relatively high airspeeds  

The following information primarily applies to fixed-wing airplanes. The maximum speed at which an airplane may be stalled safely is now determined for all newdesigns.  

This speed is called the “design maneuvering speed"  $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$  which is the speed below which you can move a single flightcontrol,onetime,to its full deflection,foroneaxis of airplane rotation only (pitch, roll or yaw), in smooth air, without risk of damage to the airplane.  $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  mustbe entered in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual/ Pilot's Operating Handbook(AFM/POH)of all recently designed airplanes. For older general aviation airplanes, this speed is approximately 1.7 times the normal stalling speed.Thus,anolder airplane that normally stalls at 60 knots must never be stalled at above 102 knots(60knots  $\times$   $1.7=102$  knots). An airplane with a normal stalling speed of 60knotsstalledat102knotsundergoes aloadfactor equal to the square of the increase in speed,or2.89Gs(1.7  $\times\;1.7=2.89\:\mathrm{e}$  Gs). (The above figures are approximations to be considered as a guide,and are not the exact answers to any set of problems. The design maneuvering speed should be determined from the particular airplane's operating limitations provided by the manufacturer.) Operating at or below design maneuvering speed does not provide structural protection against multiple full control inputs in one axis or full control inputs in more than one axis at the sametime.  

Since the leverage in the control system varies with different aircraft(some types employ"balanced"control surfaces while others do not),the pressure exerted by the pilot on the controls cannot be accepted as an indexof the load factors produced in different aircraft. In most cases, load factors can be judged by the experienced pilot from thefeel of seat pressure.Load factors can also be measured by an instrument called an "accelerometer,"but this instrument is not common in general

aviation training aircraft. The development of the ability to judge load factors from thefeelof their effect on the body is important.A knowledge of these principles is essential tothe development of the ability to estimate load factors.  

A thorough knowledge of load factors induced by varying degrees of bank and the  $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  aidsin theprevention of two of the most serious types of accidents:  

1. Stalls from steep turns or excessive maneuvering near theground 2. Structuralfailuresduringacrobaticsorotherviolent maneuvers resulting from loss of control  

# Load Factors and Flight Maneuvers  

Critical load factors apply to all flight maneuvers except un accelerated straight flight where a load factor of  $1~\mathrm{G}$  is alwayspresent.Certain maneuvers considered in this section areknown to involve relatively high load factors.Full application of pitch,roll,or yaw controls should be confined to speeds below the maneuvering speed.Avoid rapid and large alternating control inputs, especially in combination withlarge changesinpitch,roll,or yaw(e.g.,largesideslip angles) as they may result in structural failures at any speed, includingbelow  $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  

# Turns  

Increased load factors area characteristic of all banked turns. As noted in the section on load factors in steep turns, load factors become significant to both flight performance and load on wing structure as the bank increases beyond approximately  $45^{\circ}$  

The yield factor of the average light plane is reached at a bank of approximately  $70^{\circ}$  to  $75^{\circ}$  ,and the stalling speed is increasedby approximately one-half at abank off approximately  $63^{\circ}$  

# Stalls  

The normal stall entered from straight-and-level flight, or an unaccelerated straight climb, does not produce added load factors beyond the  $1~\mathrm{G}$  ofstraight-and-levelflight.Asthe stalloccurs,however,this load factor maybe reduced toward zero,the factor at which nothing seems to have weight.The pilot experiences a sensation of"floating free in space.'”If recovery is effected by snapping the elevator control forward, negativeloadfactors(orthosethatimposeadownloadon the wings and raise the pilot from the seat) may be produced.  

Duringthepull up following stall recovery,significant load factors are sometimes induced. These may be further increased inadvertently during excessive diving(and consequently high airspeed) and abrupt pull ups to level flight. One usually leads to the other, thus increasing the load factor. Abrupt pull ups at high diving speeds may impose criticalloads on aircraft structures and may produce recurrent or secondary stalls byincreasing theAOAto that of stalling  

As a generalization, a recovery from a stall made by diving only tocruising or design maneuvering airspeed,with a gradual pull up assoon asthe airspeedis safely abovestalling, can be effected with a load factor not to exceed 2 or  $2.5\,\mathrm{fs}$  .A higher load factor should never be necessary unless recovery has been effected with the aircraft's nose near or beyond the vertical attitude or at extremely low altitudes to avoid diving intotheground.  

# Spins  

Astabilizedspinisnotdifferentfromastallinanyelement other than rotation and the same load factor considerations apply to spin recovery as apply to stall recovery. Since spin recoveries are usually effected with the nose much lower than is common install recoveries,higher airspeeds and consequently higher load factors are to be expected.Theloadfactor ina proper spin recovery usually is found to be about  $2.5\:\mathrm{fs}$  +  

The load factor during a spin varies with the spin characteristics of each aircraft,butis usuallyfound tobeslightly above the  $1\,\mathrm{G}$  of levelflight. There are two reasons for this:  

1. Airspeed ina spinisverylow,usuallywithin 2knots of the unaccelerated stalling speeds. 2. An aircraft pivots, rather than turns, while it is in a spin  

# HighSpeedStalls  

The average light plane is not built towithstand therepeated application of load factors common tohigh speed stalls Theloadfactornecessaryfor thesemaneuversproduces a stress on the wings and tail structure, which does not leave a reasonable margin of safety in most light aircraft.  

The only way this stall can be induced at an airspeed above normal stalling involves the imposition of an added load factor, which may be accomplished by a severe pull on the elevator control.A speed of 1.7 times stalling speed(about 102 knots in a light aircraft with a stalling speed of 60 knots) produces a load factor of 3 Gs. Only a very narrow margin for error can be allowed for acrobatics in light aircraft. To illustrate how rapidly the load factor increases with airspeed, ahigh-speeds tall at 112 knots in the same aircraft would produce a load factor of  $4\:\mathrm{GS}$  

# C handel les and Lazy Eights  

A chandelle is a maximum performance climbing turn beginning from approximately straight-and-levelflight andending at the completion of aprecise  $180^{\circ}$  turnina wings-level, nose-high attitude at the minimum controllable airspeed. In this flight maneuver, the aircraft is in a steep climbing turn and almost stalls to gain altitude while changing direction. A lazy eight derives its name from the manner in whichtheextendedlongitudinalaxisoftheaircraftismade to trace a flight pattern in the form of a figure “8" lying on itsside.It would be difficult to make a definite statement concerning load factors in these maneuvers as both involve smooth, shallow dives and pull-ups. The load factors incurred dependdirectlyonthespeedofthedivesandtheabruptness ofthepull-ups during these maneuvers.  

Generally, the better the maneuver is performed, the less extreme the load factor induced. A chandelle or lazy eight in which the pull-up produces a load factor greater than 2 Gs will not result in as great a gain in altitude; in low-powered aircraft, it may result in a net loss of altitude.  

The smoothest pull-uppossible,with a moderate load factor, delivers the greatest gain in altitudein achandelle and results in a better overall performance in both chandelles and lazy eights.The recommended entry speed for thesemaneuvers is generally near the manufacturer's design maneuvering speed,which allows maximum development of load factors without exceeding the load limits.  

# Rough Air  

Allstandard certificated aircraft are designed towithstand loads imposed by gusts of considerable intensity. Gust load factors increase with increasing airspeed, and the strength used for design purposes usually corresponds to the highest level flight speed. In extremely rough air, as in thunderstorms or frontal conditions, it is wise to reduce the speed to the design maneuvering speed. Regardless of the speed held, there may be gusts that can produce loads that exceed the load limits.  

Each specific aircraft is designed with a specific G loading that can beimposed on the aircraft without causing structural damage. There are two types of load factors factored into aircraft design:limit load and ultimateload.Thelimit load is a force applied to an aircraft that causes a bending of the aircraft structure that does not return to the original shape. The ultimate load is the load factor applied to the aircraft beyond the limit load and at which point the aircraft material experiences structural failure(breakage).Load factors lower than the limit load can be sustained without compromising theintegrityoftheaircraftstructure.  

Speeds up to, but not exceeding, the maneuvering speed allow an aircraft to stall prior to experiencing an increase in load factor that would exceed the limit load of the aircraft.  

MostAFM/POH now include turbulent air penetration information, which help today's pilots safely fly aircraft capable of a wide range of speeds and altitudes.Itisimportant for the pilot to remember that the maximum"never-exceed" placard dive speeds are determined for smooth air only. High speed dives or acrobatics involving speed above the known maneuvering speed should never be practiced in rough or turbulentair.  

# Vg Diagram  

The flight operating strength of an aircraft is presented on a graph whose vertical scale is based onload factor. [Figure5-55]The diagram is called a  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram-velocity versus G loads or load factor. Each aircraft has its own  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram that is valid at a certain weight and altitude.  

The lines of maximum lift capability (curved lines) are the first items of importance on the  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram. The aircraft in Figure5-53iscapable of developing no more than  $+1\mathrm{~G~}$  at  $64~\mathrm{mph}$  ,the wing level stall speed of the aircraft. Since the maximum load factor varies with thesquare of the airspeed, the maximum positive lift capability of this aircraft is  $_{2\,\mathrm{G}}$  at 92 mph,  $3\,\mathrm{G}$  at  $112\,\mathrm{mph}$   $4.4\,\mathrm{G}$  at  $137\,\mathrm{mph}$  ,and soforth.Any load factor above this line is unavailable aerodynamically (i.e.,theaircraftcannotflyabovethelineofmaximumlift capabilitybecauseitstalls).Thesamesituationexistsfon negativelift flight with the exception that thespeed necessary to produce a given negative load factor is higher than that to produce the same positive load factor.  

If the aircraft is flown at a positive load factor greater than the positive limit load factor of 4.4,structural damageis possible. When the aircraft is operated in this region, objectionable permanent deformation of the primary structure may take place and a high rate of fatigue damage is incurred.Operation above thelimit load factor must be avoided in normal operation.  

There are two other points of importance on the  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram Onepoint is theintersection of the positive limit loadfactor and the line of maximum positive lift capability. The airspeed at this point is the minimum airspeed atwhichthelimit load can be developed aerodynamically.Any airspeed greater than this provides a positive lift capability sufficient to damage the aircraft. Conversely, any airspeed less than this does not provide positive lift capability sufficient to cause damage from excessive flight loads.The usual term givento this speed is “maneuvering speed,” since consideration of subsonic aerodynamics would predictminimum usable turnradius or maneuverability to occur at this condition.Themaneuver speedis a valuable reference point, since an aircraft operating below this point cannot produce a damaging positive flight load.Any combination of maneuver andgustcannot create damage due to excess air load when the aircraft is below the maneuverspeed.

Figure5-55.Typical  $V g$  diagram  

The other point of importance on the  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagramisthe intersection of the negative limit load factor and line of maximum negative lift capability.Any airspeed greater than this provides a negative lift capability sufficient to damage the aircraft; any airspeed less than this does not provide negativelift capability sufficient to damage theaircraftfrom excessive flight loads.  

The limit airspeed (or redline speed) is a design reference point for the aircraft—this aircraft is limited to  $225~\mathrm{mph}$  Ifflight is attempted beyond the limit airspeed, structural damage or structural failure may result from a variety of phenomena.  

The aircraft in flight is limited to a regimeof airspeeds and Gs that do not exceed the limit(orredline)speed,do not exceed the limit load factor,and cannot exceed the maximum lift capability. The aircraft must be operated within this“envelope" to prevent structural damage and ensure the anticipated service lift of the aircraft is obtained. The pilot must appreciate the  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram as describing the allowable combination of airspeed s and load factors for safe operation. Any maneuver, gust, or gust plus maneuver outside the structural envelope can cause structural damage and effectively shorten the service life of the aircraft.  

# Rate of Turn  

Therateofturn(ROT)isthenumberof degrees(expressedin degrees per second) of heading change that an aircraft makes. The ROT can be determined by taking the constant of 1,O91, multiplying it by the tangent of any bank angle and dividing that product by a given airspeed in knots as illustrated in Figure 5-55. If the airspeed is increased and the ROT desired is to be constant, the angle of bank must be increased, otherwise, the ROT decreases. Likewise, if the airspeed is held constant, an aircraft's ROT increases if the bank angle is increased.The formula in Figures 5-56 through 5-58 depicts the relationship between bank angle and airspeed as they affect theROT.  

NOTE: All airspeed discussed in this section is true airspeed (TAS).  

Airspeed significantly effects an aircraft's ROT. If airspeed is increased,the ROT is reduced if using the same angle of bank used atthelowerspeed.Therefore,if airspeed is increased as illustrated in Figure 5-57,it can be inferred that the angle of bank must be increased in order to achieve the same ROT achieved in Figure 5-58  

![](images/b6a32706e6453f04ba8651df1f0378c856254c96274079cc648303e411322211.jpg)  
Figure 5-56. Rate of turn for a given airspeed (knots, TAS) and bankangle.  

What does this mean on a practicable side? If a given airspeed and bank angle produces a specific ROT,additional conclusions can be made. Knowing the ROT is a given number of degrees of change per second,the number of seconds it takes to travel  $360^{\circ}$  (a circle) can be determined by simple division. For example, if moving at 120 knots with a  $30^{\circ}$  bank angle,theROTis  $5.25^{\circ}$  persecond andittakes68.6seconds  $360^{\circ}$  divided by  $5.25=68.6$  seconds)tomakea complete circle. Likewise, if flying at 240 knots TAS and using a  $30^{\circ}$  angleofbank,theROTisonly about  $2.63^{\circ}$  per second andit takes about 137 seconds to complete a  $360^{\circ}$  circle. Looking at the formula, any increase in airspeed is directly proportional to the time the aircraft takes to travel an arc.  

Sowhyis this important to understand?OncetheROTis understood, a pilot can determine the distance required to make that particular turn, which is explained in radius of turn.  

# Radius of Turn  

The radius of turn is directly linked to the ROT,which explained earlier is a function of both bank angle and airspeed. If the bank angle is held constant and the airspeed is increased, the radius of the turn changes (increases). A higher airspeed causes the aircraft to travel through a longer

arc due to a greater speed. An aircraft traveling at 120 knots is ableto turn a  $360^{\circ}$  circle in a tighter radius than an aircraft traveling at 240 knots. In order to compensate for the increase in airspeed, the bank angle would need to be increased.  

The radius of turn (R) can be computed using a simple formula. The radius of turn is equal to the velocity squared  $(\mathrm{V}^{2})$  divided by 11.26 times the tangent of the bank angle.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{R}=}&{{}}&{\frac{\mathrm{V}^{2}}{11.26\,\times\,\mathrm{tangent\,of\,bank\,angle}}}\end{array}
$$  

Using the examples provided in Figures 5-56through5-58,the turn radius for each of the two speeds can be computed.  

Note that if the speed is doubled, the radius is quadrupled [Figures5-59and5-60]  

Another way to determine the radius of turn is speed using feetpersecond(fps),  $\pi$  (3.1415), and the ROT. In one of the previous examples,it was determined that an aircraft with a ROT of 5.25 degrees per second required 68.6 seconds to make a complete circle.Anaircraft'sspeed(inknots)can

be converted to fps by multiplying it by a constant of 1.69. Therefore, an aircraft traveling at 120 knots (TAS) travels at 202.8 fps. Knowing the speed in fps (202.8) multiplied by the time an aircraft takes to complete a circle (68.6 seconds) can determine the size of thecircle;202.8times68.6equals 13,912 feet. Dividing by  $\pi$  yields a diameter of 4,428 feet, which when divided by 2 equals a radius of 2,214 feet [Figure5-61], a footwithin that determined through use of the formula in Figure 5-59  

In Figure 5-62, the pilot enters a canyon and decides to turn  $180^{\circ}$  to exit. The pilot uses a  $30^{\circ}$  bank angle in his turn.  

# Weight and Balance  

Theaircraft's weight and balance data is important informationfor a pilot that must befrequently reevaluated. Although the aircraft was weighed during the certification process, this information is not valid indefinitely. Equipment changes or modifications affect the weight and balance data. Too often pilots reduce the aircraft weight and balance into a rule of thumb, such as: ^If I have three passengers, I can load only 100 gallons of fuel; four passengers, 70 gallons.  

Weight and balance computations should be part of every preflight briefing. Never assume threepassengers are always  

![](images/76ab0310d0b7393883b616718b7d1a38475d1c9523f55565ba4573a5ebdc7b84.jpg)  
Figure5-61.Another formula that can be used for radius  

ofequalweight.Instead,do a full computation of allitems to be loaded on the aircraft, including baggage, as well as the pilot and passenger.It is recommended that allbags be weighed to make a precise computation of how the aircraft CGispositioned.  

Theimportance of the CG was stressed in the discussion of stability, controllability, and performance. Unequal load distribution causes accidents.Acompetent pilot understands and respects the effects of CG on an aircraft.  

Weight and balance are critical components in the utilization of an aircraft to its fullest potential. The pilot must know how much fuel can be loaded on to the aircraft without violating CG limits,as well as weight limits to conduct long or short flights with or without afull complement of allowable passengers.For example, an aircraft has four seats and can carry 60gallons offuel.How many passengers can the aircraft safely carry? Can all those seatsbe occupied at all times with the varying fuel loads? Four people who each weigh150 pounds leads to a different weight and balance computation than four people who each weigh 200 pounds. Thesecondscenarioloadsanadditional200poundsontothe aircraft and is equal to about 30gallons of fuel.  

The additional weight may or may not place the CG outside of the CG envelope, but the maximum gross weight could be exceeded. The excess weight can overstress the aircraft and degrade the performance.  

Aircraft are certificated for weight and balance for two principal reasons:  

The effect of the weight on the aircraft's primary structure and its performance characteristics 2 The effect of the location of this weight on flight characteristics, particularly in stall and spin recovery andstability  

Aircraft, such as balloons and weight-shift control, do not require weight and balance computations because theload is suspended below the lifting mechanism. The CG range in these types of aircraft is such that it is difficult to exceed loading limits. For example, the rear seat position and fuel of a weight-shift control aircraft are as close as possible to the hang point with the aircraft in a suspended attitude. Thus, load variations have little effect on the CG. This also holds true for the balloon basket or gondola.While it is difficult to exceed CG limits in these aircraft, pilots should never overloadan aircraft because overloading causes structural damage and failures. Weight and balance computations are not required, but pilots should calculate weight and remain within themanufacturer's established limit.  

![](images/ccbe58cf9c248ba7d2e3b6fd95179d0b2a42c4857e1aef7966aa989b24f73fd8.jpg)  
Figure5-62.Two aircraft have flown into a canyon by error.Thecanyonis5,ooofeet across and has sheer cliffs on both sides.Thepiloi in thetop imageis flying at120 knots.After realizing theerror,the pilot banks hard anduses a  $30^{\circ}$  bankangletoreversecourse.This aircraftrequiresabout4,ooofeettoturn  $I80^{\circ}$  and makes it out of the canyon safely.The pilot in the bottom image is flying at I 4 o knots  $30^{\circ}$  andalsousesa angle of bank in an attempt to reverse course.Theaircraft,although flying just 20 knots faster than the aircraft in the topimage,requiresover6,ooo feet to reverse course to safety.Unfortunately,the canyon is only 5,ooo feet across and the aircraft will hit thecanyonwall.The point is that airspeed is the most influential factor in determining how much distance is required to turn.Manypilots have made the error of increasing the steepness of their bank angle when a simple reduction of speed would have been more appropriate  

# Effect of Weight on Flight Performance  

Thetakeoff/climb and landing performance of an aircraft are determined on the basis of its maximum allowable takeoff and landing weights. A heavier gross weight results in a longer takeoff run and shallower climb,and a faster touchdown speed and longer landing roll.Even a minor overload may make it impossible for the aircraft to clear an obstacle that normally would not be a problem during takeoff under more favorable conditions.  

Thedetrimentaleffectsofoverloadingonperformanceare not limited to the immediate hazards involved with takeoffs andlandings.Overloading has an adverse effect on all climb and cruise performance,which leads to overheating during climbs, added wear on engine parts, increased fuel consumption, slower cruising speeds,and reduced range.  

The manufacturers of modern aircraft furnish weight and balance data with each aircraft produced.Generally,this information maybe found in the FAA-approvedAFM/POH andeasy-to-read charts for determining weight and balance data are now provided. Increased performance and load- carrying capability of these aircraft require strict adherence to the operating limitations prescribed by the manufacturer. Deviations from the recommendations can result in structural damage or complete failure of the aircraft'sstructure.Even if an aircraft is loaded well within the maximum weight limitations, it is imperative that weight distribution be within the limits of CG location.The preceding brief study of aerodynamics and load factors points out thereasons for this precaution.The following discussion is background information into some of the reasons why weight and balance conditions are important to the safe flight of an aircraft.  

In some aircraft, it is not possible to fill all seats, baggage compartments, and fuel tanks, and still remain within approved weight or balance limits. For example, in several popular four-place aircraft, the fuel tanks may not be filled to capacity when four occupants and their baggage are carried. In a certain two-place aircraft, no baggage may be carried in the compartment aft of the seats when spins are to be practiced. It is important for a pilot tobe aware of the weight and balance limitations of the aircraft being flown and the reasons for these limitations.  

# Effect of Weight on Aircraft Structure  

The effect of additional weight on the wing structure of an aircraft is not readily apparent. Airworthiness requirements prescribe that the structure of an aircraft certificated in the normalcategory(in which acrobatics are prohibited)must be strong enough to withstand a load factor of  $3.8\,\mathrm{fs}$  totake care of dynamic loads caused by maneuvering and gusts. This means that the primary structure of the aircraft can withstand a load of 3.8 times the approved gross weight of the aircraft without structural failure occurring.If this is accepted as indicative of theload factors that may be imposed during operations for which the aircraft is intended, a 100-pound overload imposes a potential structural overload of 380 pounds. The same consideration is even more impressive in the case of utility and acrobatic category aircraft,which have load factor requirements of 4.4 and 6.0, respectively.  

Structural failures that result from overloading maybe dramatic and catastrophic,but more often they affect structural components progressively in a manner that is difficult to detect and expensive to repair.Habitual overloading tends to cause cumulative stress and damage that may not be detected during preflight inspections and result in structural failure later during completely normal operations. The additional stress placed on structural parts by overloading is believed to accelerate the occurrence of metallic fatigue failures.  

A knowledge of load factors imposed by flight maneuvers andgustsemphasizestheconsequencesofanincreaseinthe gross weight of an aircraft. The structure of an aircraft about to undergo aload factor of3 Gs, as in recoveryfrom a steep dive, must be prepared to withstand an added load of 300pounds foreach100-pound increase in weight.Itshouldbenoted that this would be imposed by the addition of about 16 gallons of unneeded fuel in a particular aircraft.FAA-certificated civil aircraft have been analyzed structurally and tested for flight at the maximum gross weight authorized and within the speedspostedfor thetypeof flights to be performed.Flights at weights in excess of this amount are quite possible and often arewell within the performance capabilities of an aircraft. This fact should not mislead the pilot, as the pilot may not realize that loads for which the aircraft was not designed are beingimposedon all or some part of the structure.  

In loading an aircraft with either passengers or cargo, the structure must be considered.Seats,baggage compartments and cabin floors are designed for a certain load or concentration of load and no more.Forexample,alight plane baggage compartment maybe placardedfor 20 pounds because of the limited strength of its supporting structure eventhough the aircraft may not be overloaded or out of CG limits with more weight at that location.  

# Effect of Weight on Stability and Control l ability  

Overloading also affects stability.An aircraft that is stable andcontrollablewhenloadednormallymayhavevery different flight characteristics when overloaded.Although the distribution of weight has the most direct effect on this. an increase in the aircraft's gross weight maybe expected to have an adverse effect on stability,regardless of location oftheCG.Thestabilityofmanycertificatedaircraftis completely unsatisfactory if the gross weight is exceeded  

# Effect of Load Distribution  

Theeffect of theposition of theCG on theload imposed on an aircraft's wing in flight is significant to climb and cruising performance. An aircraft with forward loading is "heavier”and consequently, slower than the same aircraft withthe CGfurther aft.  

Figure5-63 illustrates why this is true.With forward loading "nose-up' trim is required in most aircraft to maintain level cruisingflight.Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces to produce a greater download on the aft portion of the fuselage,which adds to the wing loading and the total lift required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained.This requires a higher AO A of the wing,which results in more drag and, in turn, produces a higher stalling speed.  

Withaft loading and“nose-down"trim,the tail surfaces exert less down load, relieving the wing of that much wing loading and lift required to maintain altitude. The required AOA of the wing is less, so the drag is less, allowing for a faster cruise speed. Theoretically, a neutral load on the tail surfaces in cruising flight would produce the most efficient overall performance and fastest cruising speed, but it would alsoresult ininstability.Modern aircraft are designed to require a download on the tail for stability and control l ability A zero indication on the trim tab control is not necessarily the same as “neutral trim" because of the force exerted by downwash from the wings and the fuselage on the tail surfaces.  

The effects of the distribution of the aircraft's useful load have a significant influence on its flight characteristics,even when the load is within the CG limits and the maximum  

![](images/501c0932f1fa77a384128b95ba4ab01e571575a8180bfa69ace3f24dd2e1c114.jpg)  
Figure5-63.Effect of load distribution on balance.  

permissible gross weight. Important among these effects are changes in control l ability,stability,and the actualload imposed onthewing.  

Generally,an aircraft becomes less controllable,especially at slow flight speeds,as the CG is moved further aft.An aircraft that cleanly recovers from a prolonged spin with theCG at one position may fail completely to respond to normal recovery attempts when the CGi s move daft by one ortwoinches.  

It is common practice for aircraft designers to establish a naft CG limit that is within one inch of the maximum, which allows normal recovery from a one-turnspin.When certificatinganaircraftintheutilitycategorytopermit intentional spins,the af tCG limit is usually established at a point several inches forward of that permissible for certification in the normal category  

Another factor affecting controllability, which has become more important in current designs of large aircraft, is the effect of long moment arms tothepositions of heavy equipment and cargo. The same aircraft may be loaded to maximum gross weight within its CG limits by concentrating fuel, passengers, and cargo near the design CG, or by dispersingfuel and cargoloads inwingtip tanks and cargo binsforward and aft of thecabin.  

With the same total weight and CG,maneuvering the aircraft or maintaining level flight in turbulent air requires the application of greater control forces when the load is dispersed. The longer moment arms to the positions of the heavy fuel and cargo loads must be overcome by the action of the control surfaces.An aircraft with full outboard wing tanks or tip tanks tends to be sluggish in roll when control situations are marginal,while one with full nose and aft cargo bins tends to be less responsive to the elevator controls.  

The rearward CG limit of an aircraft is determined largely by considerations of stability. The original airworthiness requirementsfor a type certificate specify that an aircraft in flight at acertainspeed dampens outvertical displacement of the nose within a certain number of oscillations.Anaircraft loaded too far rearward may not do this. Instead, when the nose is momentarily pulled up, it may alternately climb and dive becoming steeper with each oscillation. This instability is not only uncomfortable to occupants,butitcouldeven become dangerous by making the aircraft unmanageable under certain conditions.  

The recovery from a stall in any aircraft becomes progressively more difficult as its CG moves aft. This is particularly important in spin recovery, as there is a point in rearward loading of any aircraft at which a “flat" spin develops. A flat spin is one in which centrifugal force, acting through a CG located well to the rear, pulls the tail of the aircraft out away from the axis of the spin, making it impossible to get the nose down and recover.  

An aircraft loaded to the rear limit of its permissible CG rangehandles differentlyin turns and stall maneuvers and has different landing characteristics than when it is loaded near the forward limit  

The forward CG limit is determined by a number of considerations. As a safety measure, it is required that the trimming device, whether tab or adjustable stabilizer,be capable of holding the aircraft in a normal glide with the power off.A conventional aircraft must be capable of a full stall, power-offlandingin order to ensure minimum landing speed in emergencies.A tailwheel-type aircraft loaded excessively nose-heavy is difficult to taxi, particularly in high winds. It can be nosed over easily by use of the brakes,and it is difficult to land without bouncing since it tends to pitch down on the wheels as it is slowed down and flared for landing. Steering difficulties on the ground may occur in nose wheel-type aircraft, particularly during the landing roll and takeoff. The effects of load distribution are summarized as follows:  

The CG position influences the lift and AO A of the wing,the amount and direction of force on the tail, and the degree of deflection of the stabilizer needed to supply the proper tail force for equilibrium. The latter is very important because of its relationship to elevator control force. The aircraft stalls at a higherspeed witha forward CG location. This is because the stalling AOA is reached at a higher speed due to increased wing loading. Higher elevatorcontrol forces normally exist with a forward CG location due to the increased stabilizer deflection required to balance the aircraft. The aircraft cruises faster with an aft CG location because of reduced drag.The drag is reduced because a smaller AO A and less downward deflection of the stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. The aircraft becomes less stable as the CGi s moved rearward. This is because when the CG is moved rearward, it causes a decrease in the AOA. Therefore, the wing contribution to the aircraft'sstabilityis nowdecreased,while the tail contribution is still stabilizing. When the point is reached that the wing and tail contributions balance, then neutral stability exists. Any CG movement further aft results in an unstableaircraft.  

A forward CG location increases the need for greater back elevator pressure.The elevator maynolonger be able to oppose any increase in nose-down pitching. Adequate elevator control is needed to control the aircraft throughout the airspeed range down to the stall.  

A detailed discussion and additional information relating toweight and balance can be found in Chapter 1o,Weighi andBalance.  

# High Speed Flight  

# SubsonicVersusSupersonicFlow  

In subsonic aerodynamics,the theory of lift is based upon the forces generated on a body and a moving gas (air) in which it is immersed. At speeds of approximately 260 knots or less,air can be considered incompressible in that,at a fixed altitude, its density remains nearly constant while its pressure varies.Underthis assumption,air actsthesame aswater and is classified as a fluid.Subsonic aerodynamic theory also assumes the effects of viscosity (the property of a fluid that tends toprevent motion of one part of the fluid with respect to another) are negligible and classifies air as an ideal fluid conforming to the principles of ideal-fluid aerodynamics such as continuity, Bernoulli's principle, and circulation.  

Inreality,airiscompressibleandviscous.Whiletheeffectsof theseproperties are negligible at low speeds,compressibility effects in particular become increasingly important as speed increases.Compressibility(and to a lesser extent viscosity)is of paramount importance at speeds approaching the speed of sound. In these speed ranges, compressibility causes a change in thedensityof the air around an aircraft  

During flight, a wing produces lift by accelerating the airflow over the upper surface.This accelerated air can,and does, reach sonic speeds even though the aircraft itself may be flying subsonic.At some extreme A OAs,insomeaircraft,thespeed of the air over the top surface of the wing maybe double the aircraft's speed.It is therefore entirely possible to have both supersonic andsubsonic airflow onanaircraft atthesametime. When flow velocities reach sonic speeds at some location on an aircraft(such as the area of maximum camber on the wing), further acceleration results in the onset of compressibility effects, such as shock wave formation, drag increase, buffeting, stability,andcontrol difficulties.Subsonic flow principles are invalid at allspeeds above thispoint. [Figure5-64]  

# Speed Ranges  

The speed of sound varies with temperature. Under standard temperature conditions of  $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,thespeedofsound atsea level is 661 knots.At 40,000 feet, where the temperature is  $-55~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,the speed of sound decreases to 574 knots. In high

speed flight and/or high-altitude flight, the measurement of speed is expressed in terms of a“Mach number"—the ratio of the true airspeed of the aircraft to the speed of sound in the same atmospheric conditions.An aircraft traveling at thespeedof sound istraveling at Mach1.0.Aircraftspeed regimes are defined approximately as follows:  

Subsonic—Mach numbers below 0.75 TransonicMach numbers from 0.75 to 1.20 Supersonic—Mach numbers from1.20 to 5.00 Hypersonic Mach numbers above 5.00  

Whileflightsinthetransonicandsupersonicrangesare common occurrences for military aircraft, civilian jet aircraft normally operate in a cruise speed range of MachO.7 to Mach0.90.  

The speed of an aircraft in which airflow over any part of the aircraft or structure under consideration first reaches (but does notexceed)Mach 1.0 is termed“critical Mach number”or“MachCrit."Thus,critical Mach number is the boundary between subsonic and transonic flight and is largely dependent on the wing and airfoil design. Critical Mach number is an important point in transonic flight. When shock waves form on the aircraft, airflow separation followed by buffet and aircraft control difficulties can occur.Shock waves,buffet,and air flow separation take place above critical Mach number. A jet aircraft typically is most efficient when cruising at or near its critical Mach number.Atspeeds5-10 percent above the critical Mach number,compressibility effects begin. Drag begins to rise sharply. Associated with the “drag rise” are buffet, trim, and stability changes and a decrease in control surface effectiveness. This is the point of“drag divergence."[Figure 5-65]  

$\mathrm{V_{MO}/M_{M O}}$  is defined as the maximum operating limit speed.

  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$  is expressed inknots calibrated airspeed (KCAS),while  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  is expressed in Mach number. The  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$  limit isusually associated with operations at lower altitudes and deals with structural loads and flutter.The  $\mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  limit is associated with operations at higher altitudes and is usually more concerned with compress i bil it y effects and flutter.At lower altitudes, structural loads and flutter are of concern; at higher altitudes. compress i bil it y effects and flutter are of concern.  

Adherence to these speeds prevents structural problems due to dynamic pressure or flutter,degradation in aircraft control response due to compressibility effects (e.g., Mach Tuck, aileronreversal,orbuzz),and separated air flow due to shock waves resulting in loss of lift or vibration and buffet.Anyof these phenomena could prevent the pilot from being able to adequately control the aircraft  

For example, an early civilian jet aircraft had a  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$  limit of 306 KCAS up to approximately FL 310 (on a standard day). At this altitude (FL 310), an  $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  of 0.82 was approximately equal to  $306~\mathrm{KCAS}$  . Above this altitude, an  $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  of 0.82 alwaysequaledaKCASlessthan  $306~\mathrm{KCAS}$   and, thus, became the operating limit as you could not reach the  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$  limit without first reaching the  $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  limit. For example, at FL 380, an  $\mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  of 0.82 is equal to 261 KCAS.  

# Mach Number Versus Airspeed  

It is important to understand how airspeed varies with Mach number. As an example, consider how the stall speed of a jet transport aircraft varies with an increase in altitude. The increase in altitude results in a corresponding drop in air density and outside temperature. Suppose this jet transport is in the clean configuration (gear and flaps up) and weighs 550,000 pounds. The aircraft might stall at approximately 152 KCAS at sea level. This is equal to (on a standard day) a true velocity of152 KTAS and a Mach numberof0.23.At FL 380, the aircraft will still stall at approximately 152 KCAs,but the true velocity is about 287 KT AS with a Mach number of 0.50  

![](images/7468539c4672611ef840235ae07d21da0d6b56e48a271fcd65d5a72fc7bc746a.jpg)  
Figure5-65.CriticalMach  

Although the stalling speed has remained the same for our purposes, both the Mach number and TAS have increased. With increasing altitude, the air density has decreased; this requires a faster true airspeed in order tohave the same pressure sensed by the pit ot tube for the same KC AS,orKIAS (for our purposes, KCAS and KIAS are relatively close to each other). The dynamic pressure the wing experiences at FL 380 at 287 KT AS is the same as at sea level at 152 KT AS. However, it is flying at higher Mach number.  

Another factor to consider is the speed of sound.Adecrease in temperature in a gas results in a decrease in the speed off sound.Thus,as the aircraft climbs in altitude with outside temperature dropping, the speed of sound is dropping. At sealevel,the speed of sound is approximately 661 KC AS, whileatFL380itis574KCAS.Thus,forourjettransport aircraft, the stall speed (in KTAs) has gone from 152 at sea level to 287 at FL 380.Simultaneously, the speed of sound (in KCAS) has decreased from 661 to 574 and the Mach number has increased from 0.23(152 KT AS divided by 661 KTAS)to0.50(287 KT AS divided by 574 KT AS).Allthe while,theKCASforstallhasremainedconstant at152.This describes what happens when the aircraft is at a constant KC AS with increasing altitude,but what happens when the pilot keeps Mach constant during the climb? In normal jet flight operations, the climb is at 250 KIAS (or higher (e.g. heavy))to10,000feet and then at a specified en route climb airspeed (about 330 if a DCi0)until reaching an altitude in the “mid-twenties"where the pilot then climbs at a constant Mach number to cruise altitude.  

Assuming for illustration purposes that the pilot climbs at a  $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  of 0.82 from sea level up toFL380.KCASg0esfrom 543to261.The KI AS at each altitude would follow the same behavior and just differ by a few knots.Recallfrom the earlier discussion that the speed of sound is decreasing with the drop in temperature as the aircraft climbs.TheMach number is simply the ratio of the true airspeed to the speed of sound at flight conditions.The significance of thisisthat ataconstantMachnumberclimb,theKCAS(andKTASor KIAS aswell)isfallingoff.  

If the aircraft climbed high enough at this constant  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  with decreasingKIAS,KCAS,and KTAS,itwould beginto approach its stall speed. At some point, the stall speed of the aircraft in Mach number could equal the  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  oftheaircraft and the pilot could neither slowdown(withoutstalling)nor speedup(without exceeding the max operating speed of the aircraft).Thishasbeendubbedthe“coffincorner."  

# Boundary Layer  

Theviscous nature of airflowreduces the local velocities on a surface and is responsible for skinfriction.As discussed earlierin the chapter, thelayer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity is the boundary layer. There are two different types of boundary layer flow: laminar andturbulent.  

# LaminarBoundaryLayerFlow  

The laminar boundary layer is a very smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or eddies. Thelaminarflowcreateslessskinfrictiondragthanthe turbulentflowbutislessstable.Boundarylayerflowover a wing surfacebegins as a smoothlaminar flow.As theflow continues backfrom theleading edge,thelaminar boundary layer increases in thickness.  

# Turbulent Boundary Layer Flow  

At some distance back from the leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible or have a large amount of thewing surfacewithin the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.  

# Boundary Layer Separation  

Another phenomenon associated with viscous flow is separation.Separation occurs when the airflowbreaks away from an airfoil. The natural progression is from laminar boundarylayer to turbulent boundarylayer and then to air flow separation.Air flow separation produceshigh drag and ultimately destroys lift. The boundary layer separation point moves forward on the wing as the AOA is increased. [Figure5-66]  

Vortex generators are used to delay or prevent shock wave induced boundary layer separation encountered in transonic flight.They are small low aspect ratio airfoils place data  $12^{\circ}$  to  $15^{\circ}$  AO A to the air stream.Usually spaced a few inches apart along the wing ahead of the ailerons or other control surfaces, vortex generators create a vortex that mixes the boundary air flow with the high energy air flow just abovethe surface.This produceshigher surface velocities and increases the energy of the boundary layer.Thus,a stronger shockwave is necessary to produce air flow separation.  

# Shock Waves  

When an airplane flies at subsonic speeds,the air ahead is "warned"of the airplane's comingby a pressure change transmitted ahead of the airplane at the speed of sound Becauseof thiswarning,the airbeginstomove asidebefore the airplane arrives and is prepared tolet it pass easily. When theairplane's speed reaches the speed of sound,thepressure

Figure5-66.Boundarylayer  

changecan nolonger warn the air aheadbecause the airplane is keeping up with its own pressure waves. Rather, the air particles pile up in front of the airplane causing a sharp decrease in theflow velocity directlyinfront of the airplane with a corresponding increase in airpressure and density  

Astheairplane's speed increases beyond the speed of sound, the pressure and density of the compressed air ahead of it increase, the area of compression extending some distance ahead of the airplane.At some point in the air stream,theair particles are completely undisturbed, having had no advanced warning of the airplane's approach, and in the next instant the same air particles are forced to undergo sudden and drastic changes in temperature,pressure,density,and velocity. The boundary between the undisturbed air and the region of compressed air is called a shock or “compression"wave. This same type of wave is formed whenever a supersonic air stream is slowed to subsonic without a change in direction, such as when the airstream is accelerated to sonic speed over the cambered portion of a wing, and then decelerated to subsonic speed as the area of maximum camberis passed. A shockwaveforms as a boundarybetween thesupersonic and subsonic ranges  

Whenever a shock waveforms perpendicular to the airflow,it is termed a“normal"shock wave,and the flow immediately behind the wave is subsonic. A supersonic airstream passing through a normal shock wave experiences these changes:  

The airstream isslowed tosubsonic. The air flow immediately behind theshockwave does not change direction. The static pressure and density of the airstream behind the wave is greatly increased. The energy of the airstream (indicated by total pressure—dynamic plus static) is greatly reduced.  

Shock wave formation causes an increase in drag. One of the principal effects of a shock wave is the formation of a dense high pressure region immediately behind the wave. The instability of the high pressure region, and the fact that part of the velocity energy of the airstream is converted to heat as it flows through thewave,is a contributing facton in the drag increase, but the drag resulting from airflow separation is much greater. If the shock wave is strong, the boundary layer may not have sufficient kinetic energy to withstand airflow separation. The drag incurred in the transonic region due to shockwave formation and air flow separation is known as "wave drag." When speed exceeds the critical Mach number by about 10 percent, wave drag increases sharply.A considerable increase in thrust(power) is required to increase flight speed beyond this point into the supersonic range where, depending on the airfoil shape and theAOA,the boundary layer may reattach.  

Normal shock waves form on the wing's upper surface and form an additional area of supersonic flow and a normal shock waveon thelowersurface.As flight speed approaches the speed of sound, the areas of supersonic flow enlarge and the shockwaves move nearer thetrailingedge.[Figure5-67]  

![](images/602ee87172b20ec46d6d43674a1c8834b0ad359378247da4b2fc51963b4bab91.jpg)  
Figure5-67.Shockwaves.  

Associated with“drag rise"arebuffet(knownasMach buffet), trim, and stability changes and a decrease in control force effectiveness.The loss of lift due to air flow separation results in a loss of downwash and a change in the position of the center pressure on the wing.Air flow separation produces a turbulent wake behind the wing, which causes the tail surfaces tobuffet(vibrate).The nose-up and nose-downpitch controlprovidedbythehorizontaltail isdependentonthe downwash behind the wing. Thus, an increase in downwash decreases thehorizontal tail'spitchcontrol effectiveness since it effectively increases the AO A that the tail surface is seeing. Movement of the wing CP affects the wing pitching moment.If theCP moves aft,a diving moment referred to as"Mach tuck”or“tuckunder"is produced, and ifit moves forward, a nose-up moment is produced. This is the primary reason for the development of the T-tail configuration on manyturbine-poweredaircraft,which places the horizontal stabilizer as far as practical from the turbulence of the wings  

# Sweepback  

Most of the difficulties of transonic flight are associated with shockwave induced flow separation.Therefore,anymeans of delaying or alleviating the shock induced separation improves aerodynamic performance.One method is wing sweepback. Sweepback theoryis based upon the concept that it is only the component of the airflow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing that affects pressure distribution and formation ofshockwaves.[Figure5-68]  

On a straight wing aircraft, the airflow strikes the wing leadingedge at  $90^{\circ}$  , and its full impact produces pressure and lift. A wing with sweepback is struck by the same airflow at an angle smaller than  $90^{\circ}$  .This airflow on the swept winghas the effect of persuading the wing into believing that it is flying slower than it really is; thus the formation of shock waves is delayed. Advantages of wing sweep include an increase in critical Mach number, force divergence Mach number, and theMach number at which drag risepeaks. In other words. sweepdelaysthe onset of compress i bil it y effects.  

The Mach number that produces a sharp change in coefficient of drag is termed the“force divergence”Mach number and, for most airfoils, usually exceeds the critical Mach number by 5 to 10 percent. At this speed, the airflow separation induced by shock waveformation can create significant variations in the drag, lift, or pitching moment coefficients. In addition to thedelay of the onset of compressibility effects,sweepback reduces the magnitude in the changes of drag, lift, or moment coefficients.Inotherwords,the use of sweep back"softens the force divergence.  

A disadvantage of swept wings is that they tend to stall atthe wingtips rather than at the wing roots.[Figure 5-69] This is  

![](images/83737c6ad7a442ee82300a7f0eaa5d6ca75d4639b6cf7458f56caadb72b64f2f.jpg)  
Figure5-68.Sweepbackeffect.  

because the boundary layer tends to flow span wise toward the tips and to separate near the leading edges.Because the tips of a swept wing are on the aft part of the wing (behind the CL), a wingtip stall causes the CL to move forward on thewing,forcing the nose to rise further.Thetendencyfor tips tallis greatest when wing sweep and taper are combined  

The stall situation can be aggravated by a T-tail configuration, which affords little or no pre-stall warning in the form of tail control surface buffet. [Figure 5-7o] The T-tail,being above the wing wake remains effectiveeven after thewing has begun to stall, allowing the pilot to inadvertently drive the wing intoadeeperstallatamuchgreaterAOA.Ifthehorizontal tail surfaces then become buried in the wing's wake, the elevator may lose all effectiveness, making it impossible to reducepitch attitude and break the stall.In thepre-stall and immediatepost-stall regimes,thelift/dragqualities ofaswept wing aircraft(specifically the enormous increase in drag atlowspeeds)can cause an increasingly descending flight path with no change in pitch attitude, further increasing the

AOA.Inthissituation,without reliable AO A information, a nose-down pitch attitude with an increasing airspeed is no guarantee that recovery has been affected, and up-elevator movement at this stage may merelykeep the aircraft stalled.  

It is a characteristic of T-tail aircraft to pitch up viciously when stalled in extreme nose-high attitudes,making recovery difficult or violent. The stick pusher inhibits this type of stall.At approximately oneknot abovestall speed, pre-programmed stick forces automatically move the stick forward, preventing the stall from developing. A G-limiter may also be incorporated into the system to prevent the pitch down generated by the stick pusher from imposing excessive loads on the aircraft. A “stick shaker," on the other hand, provides stallwarning when the airspeed isfive to seven percent above stall speed.  

# Mach Buffet Boundaries  

Machbuffetis afunction of thespeed of the airflowover the wing—not necessarily the speed of the aircraft.Anytimethat too great a lift demand is made on the wing,whetherfromtoo fast an airspeed or from too high an AOA near the  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$  the "high-speed’buffet occurs.There are also occasions when the buffet can be experienced at much lower speeds known asthe"low-speedMachbuffet.'  

An aircraft flown at a speed too slow for its weight anc altitude necessitating a high AOA is the most likely situation tocausealow-speedMachbuffet.This very high AO A has theeffect ofincreasing airflowvelocity over theuppersurface of the wing until the same effects of the shockwaves and buffet occur as in the high-speed buffet situation. The AOA of the wing has the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet at either the high-speedorlow-speed boundaries for the aircraft. The conditions that increase the AOA, the speed of the airflow over the wing, and chances of Mach buffet are:  

High altitudes—the higher an aircraft flies, the thinner theair and thegreater theAOArequired toproduce thelift needed to maintain level flight Heavy weights—the heavier the aircraft, the greater the lift required of the wing, and all other factors being equal,the greater the AO A. G loading—-an increase in the G loading on the aircraft has the same effect as increasing the weight of the aircraft.WhethertheincreaseinGforcesiscaused by turns,rough control usage,orturbulence,theeffect of increasing the wing's AOA is the same.  

# High Speed Flight Controls  

Onhigh-speedaircraft,flight controls are divided into primaryflight controls and secondary or auxiliary flight controls.Theprimaryflightcontrolsmaneuvertheaircraft about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes. They include the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. Secondary or auxiliary flight controls include tabs, leading edge flaps, trailing edge flaps, spoilers andslats.  

Spoilers are used on the upper surface of the wing tospoil on reducelift.High speed aircraft,due to their cleanlow drag design, use spoilers as speed brakes to slow them down. Spoilers are extended immediately after touchdown to dump lift and thus transfer theweight of the aircraftfrom thewings onto the wheels for better braking performance.[Figure5-71]  

Jet transport aircraft have small ailerons.Thespacefor ailerons is limited because asmuch of the wing trailing edge as possible is needed for flaps.Also,aconventional size aileron would cause wing twist at high speed.Forthat reason,spoilers are used in unison with ailerons to provide additional roll control.  

Somejettransportshavetwosetsof ailerons,apairofoutboard low-speed ailerons and a pair of high-speed inboard ailerons. Whentheflaps arefully retracted after takeoff, the outboard ailerons are automatically locked out in the faired position.  

When used for roll control, the spoiler on the side of the up-going aileron extends and reduces the lift on that side, causingthewingtodrop.Ifthespoilers areextended asspeed brakes, they can still be used for roll control. If they are the

differential type,they extend further on oneside and retract ontheotherside.Iftheyarethenon-differential type,they extend further on one side but do not retract on the other side. When fully extended asspeed brakes,thenon-differential spoilers remain extended and do not supplement the ailerons.  

To obtain a smoothstall and a higher AOAwithout airflow separation,thewing's leadingedge shouldhave awell- rounded almost blunt shape that the airflow can adhere to at the higher AOA. With this shape, the airflow separation starts at the trailing edge and progresses forward gradually a sAo A is increased.  

around the wing leading edge.The air flow tends to tear loose rather suddenly from the upper surface at a moderate AOA. To utilize trailing edge flaps, and thus increase the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  thewing must goto a higher AOAwithout air flow separation. Therefore, leading edge slots, slats, and flaps are used to improvethelow-speed characteristics during takeoff,climb and landing. Although these devices are not as powerful as trailing edge flaps, they are effective when used full span in combination with high-lift trailing edge flaps. With the aid of these sophisticated high-liftdevices,air flow separation is delayed and the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  is increased considerably. In fact, a 50 knot reduction in stall speed is not uncommon.  

The pointed leading edge necessary for high-speed flight resultsinanabruptstallandrestrictstheuseoftrailingedge flaps because the air flow cannot follow the sharp curve The operational requirements of alargejet transport aircraft necessitate large pitch trim changes.Some requirements are:  

A largeCGrange A largespeed range The ability to perform large trim changes due to wing leading edge and trailing edge high-lift devices without limiting the amount of elevator remaining Maintaining trim drag to a minimum  

# Chapter Summary  

In order to sustain an aircraft in flight, a pilot must understand how thrust, drag, lift, and weight act on the aircraft. By understanding the aerodynamics of flight, how design, weight, load factors, and gravity affect an aircraft during flight maneuvers from stalls to high speed flight, the pilot learns how to control the balancebetween these forces. For information on stall speeds,load factors, and otherimportant aircraftdata,always consult the AFM/POHforspecific information pertaining to the aircraft being flown.  

These requirements are met by the use of a variable incidence horizontal stabilizer. Large trim changes on a fixed-tail aircraft require large elevator deflections.At theselarge deflections,little further elevator movement remains in the samedirection.A variable incidence horizontal stabilizer is designed to take out the trim changes. The stabilizer is larger than the elevator,and consequently does not need to be moved through as large an angle. This leaves the elevator streamlining the tail plane with a full range of movement up anddown.The variable incidence horizontal stabilizer can be set to handle the bulk of the pitch control demand, with the elevator handling the rest. On aircraft equipped with a variable incidence horizontal stabilizer,the elevator is smaller and less effective in isolation than it is on a fixed-tailaircraft In comparison to other flight controls, the variable incidence horizontal stabilizer is enormously powerful in its effect.  

Because of the size and high speeds of jet transport aircraft. the forces required to move the control surfaces can be beyond the strength of the pilot.Consequently,the control surfaces are actuated by hydraulic or electrical power units. Moving the controls in the flight decksignals thecontrol anglerequired, and the power unit positions the actual control surface. In the event of completepower unitfailure,movementof thecontrol surface can be affected by manually controlling the control tabs.Moving the control tabupsets the aerodynamic balance, which causes the control surface tomove.  

# Chapter 6 Flight Controls  

# Introduction  

This chapterfocuses on the flightcontrol systems apilot uses to control the forces of flight and the aircraft's direction and attitude. It should be noted that flight control systems and characteristics can vary greatly depending on the type of aircraft flown. The most basic flight control system designs are mechanical and date back to early aircraft. They operate with a collection of mechanical parts, such as rods, cables, pulleys, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces of the flight deck controls to the control surfaces.Mechanical flight control systems are still used today in small general and sport category aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive.[Figure6-1]  

![](images/c97c8ad57037429068c961423a95bb25a90c66942c031432f449cccbe8efde0f.jpg)  
Figure6-1.Mechanical flight control system.  

As aviationmatured and aircraft designers learned more about aerodynamics, the industry produced larger and faster aircraft. Therefore, the aerodynamic forces acting upon the control surfaces increased exponentially. To make the control force required by pilots manageable, aircraft engineers designed more complex systems. At first, hydromechanical designs, consisting of a mechanical circuit and a hydraulic circuit, were used to reduce the complexity, weight, and limitations of mechanical flight controls systems.[Figure 6-2]  

As aircraft became more sophisticated,the control surfaces were actuated by electric motors,digital computers,orfiber optic cables. Called “fly-by-wire,” this flight control system replaces the physical connection between pilot controls and the flight control surfaces with an electrical interface. In addition,in some large and fast aircraft,controls are boosted by hydraulically or electrically actuated systems.In both thefly-by-wire and boosted controls,the feel of the control reaction isfed back to thepilot bysimulated means.  

Current research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center involves Intelligent Flight Control Systems (IFCS). The goal

of thisprojectis to develop an adaptive neural network-based flight control system.Applied directly toflight control system feedback errors, IFCS provides adjustments to improve aircraft performance in normal flight,as well as with system failures.WithIFCS,a pilot is able to maintain control and safely land an aircraft that has suffered a failure to a control surface or damage to the airframe.It also improves mission capability, increases the reliability and safety of flight, and eases the pilot workload.  

Today's aircraft employ avariety offlight control systems. Forexample,some aircraft in the sport pilot category rely on weight-shift control to fly while balloons use a standard burn technique.Helicopters utilize a cyclic to tilt the rotor in the desired direction along with a collective to manipulate rotor pitchandanti-torque pedals to control yaw.[Figure6-3]

# Flight Control Systems  

# Flight Controls  

Aircraft flight control systems consist of primaryand secondary systems. The ailerons, elevator (or stabilator), and rudder constitute the primary control system and are required to control an aircraft safely duringflight.Wing flaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems constitute the secondary control system and improve the performance characteristics of the airplane or relieve the pilot of excessive controlforces.  

# Primary Flight Controls  

Aircraft control systems are carefully designed to provide adequate responsiveness to control inputs while allowing a  

![](images/936231c38eb9998f13564b48d14a5e9a28d9132d6361f2d3e8d43d86d2b11295.jpg)  
Figure6-3.Helicopter flight control system  

natural feel.At low airspeeds, the controls usually feel soft and sluggish, and the aircraft responds slowly to control applications.At higher airspeeds,the controls become increasingly firm and aircraft response is more rapid.  

Movement of any of the three primary flight control surfaces (ailerons,elevator orstabilator,orrudder),changesthe air flow and pressure distribution over and around the airfoil. These changes affect the lift and drag produced by the airfoil/ control surface combination,and allow a pilot to control the aircraft about its three axes of rotation.  

Design features limit the amount of deflection of flight controlsurfaces.Forexample,control-stopmechanismsmay be incorporated into the flight control linkages,ormovement of the control column and/or rudder pedals maybe limited. The purpose of these design limits is to prevent the pilot from inadvertently overcontrolling and overstressing the aircraft during normal maneuvers.  

A properly designed aircraft is stable and easily controlled during normal maneuvering. Control surface inputs cause movement about thethreeaxes of rotation.The types of stability an aircraft exhibits alsorelatetothe three axes of rotation.[Figure6-4]  

![](images/59e0e49dc05532f1cfc40245fe2865a58945f79dec76c1d7e2f193d2802f1a60.jpg)  
Figure6-4.Airplane controls,movement,axesofrotation,and typeofstability.  

# Ailerons  

Ailerons control roll about the longitudinal axis. The ailerons are attached tothe outboard trailingedge of eachwing and move in the opposite direction from each other.Ailerons are connected by cables,bellcranks, pulleys, and/or push-pull tubes to a control wheel or control stick.  

Moving the control wheel,orcontrolstick,totheright causes the right aileron to deflect upward and the left aileron to deflect downward.The upward deflection of theright aileron decreases the camber resulting in decreased lift on the right wing. The corresponding downward deflection of the left aileron increases the camber resulting in increased lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift on the left wing and the decreased lift on the rightwing causes the aircraft toroll totheright  

# AdverseYaw  

Since the downward deflected aileron produces more lift as evidenced by the wing raising, it also produces more drag This added drag causes the wing to slow down slightly This results in the aircraft yawing toward the wing which had experienced an increase in lift (and drag). From the pilot's perspective, the yaw is opposite the direction of the bank. The adverseyaw is a result of differential drag and the slight difference in the velocity of the left and right wings [Figure6-5]  

Adverse yaw becomes more pronounced at low airspeeds At these slower airspeeds, aerodynamic pressure on control surfaces are low, and larger control inputs are required to  

![](images/a206f9ab12d7e4466c1ae9d0aeaec67f5b1d8d74ccd8d297897fee11a0e3567b.jpg)  
Figure6-5.Adverse yaw is caused by higher dragon the outside wing that is producing more lift.  

effectively maneuver the aircraft. As a result, the increase in aileron deflection causes anincreasein adverseyaw.The yaw is especially evident in aircraft with long wing spans.  

Application of the rudder is used to counteract adverse yaw. The amount of rudder control required is greatest at low airspeeds,high angles of attack,andwithlarge aileron deflections.Like all control surfaces at lower airspeed s the vertical stabilizer/rudder becomes less effective and magnifies the control problems associated with adverse yaw.  

All turns are coordinated by use of ailerons, rudder, and elevator.Applying aileron pressure is necessary to place the aircraft in the desired angle of bank, while simultaneous application of rudder pressureis necessary tocounteract the resultant adverse yaw. Additionally, because more lift is required during a turn than during straight-and-level flight. the angle of attack (AOA) must be increased by applying elevator back pressure.The steeper the turn, the more elevator back pressure that is needed.  

As the desired angle of bank is established,aileron and rudder pressures should be relaxed.This stops the angle of bank from increasing, because the aileron and rudder control surfacesarein aneutral and streamlined position.Elevator back pressure should beheld constant to maintain altitude. The roll-out from a turn is similar to the roll-in, except the flight controls are applied in the opposite direction. The aileron and rudder are applied in the direction of the roll-out or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank decreases, the elevator back pressure should be relaxed as necessary to maintain altitude.  

In an attempt to reduce the effects of adverse yaw, manufacturers have engineered four systems:differential ailerons, frise-type ailerons, coupled ailerons and rudder, andflaperons.  

# Differential Ailerons  

With differential ailerons,one aileron is raised a greater distance than the other aileron and is lowered for a given movement of the control wheel or control stick. This produces an increase in drag on the descending wing. The greater drag results from deflecting the up aileron on the descending wing to a greater angle than the down aileron on the rising wing While adverse yaw is reduced, it is not eliminated completely [Figure6-6]  

# Frise-TypeAilerons  

With a frise-type aileron,whenpressure is applied tothe control wheel, or control stick, the aileron thatis being raised pivots on an offset hinge. This projects the leading edge of the aileron into the airflow and creates drag. It helps equalize

the drag created by the lowered aileron on the opposite wing and reduces adverse yaw.[Figure6-7]  

Thefrise-typeaileron alsoforms as lotso air flows smoothly over the lowered aileron,making it more effective at high anglesofattack.Frise-type ailerons may also be designed tofunction differentially.Likethe differential aileron,the frise-type aileron does not eliminate adverseyaw entirely. Coordinated rudder application is still needed when ailerons areapplied.  

# Coupled Ailerons and Rudder  

Coupled ailerons and rudder are linked controls. This is accomplished with rudder-aileron interconnect springs, which help correct for aileron drag by automatically deflecting the rudder at the same time the ailerons are deflected. For

example,when the control wheel,orcontrolstick,ismoved to produce a left roll, the interconnect cable and spring pulls forward on the left rudder pedal just enough to prevent the noseof the aircraft from yawing to the right.Theforce applied to the rudder by the springs can be overridden if it becomes necessary to slip the aircraft.[Figure6-8]  

# Flaperons  

Flaperons combine both aspects of flaps and ailerons. In addition to controlling the bank angle of an aircraft like conventional ailerons,fla peron s can be lowered together to function much the same as a dedicated set of flaps. The pilot retains separate controls for ailerons andflaps.Amixer is used to combine the separate pilot inputs into this single set of control surfaces called flaperons. Many designs that incorporate flaperons mount the control surfaces away from the wing to provide undisturbed air flow at high angles of attack and/orlow airspeeds.[Figure6-9]  

# Elevator  

The elevator controlspitch about thelateral axis.Like the ailerons on small aircraft,the elevator is connected to the control column in the flight deck by a series of mechanical

linkages.Aft movement of the controlcolumn deflects the trailing edge of the elevator surface up. This is usually referred to as the up-elevator position.[Figure 6-10]  

Theup-elevator position decreases thecamber oftheelevator and creates a downward aerodynamic force,whichis greater than the normal tail-down force that exists in straight-and- level flight. The overall effect causes the tail of the aircraft to movedown and the nosetopitch up.The pitching moment occurs about the center of gravity (CG). The strength of the pitching moment is determined by the distance between theCG and the horizontal tail surface,as well as bythe aerodynamic effectiveness of thehorizontal tail surface. Moving the control column forward has the opposite effect. In this case, elevator camber increases,creating more lift (lesstail-downforce)on the horizontal stabilizer/elevator This moves the tail upward and pitches the nose down. Again. the pitching moment occurs about the CG.  

As mentioned earlier, stability, power, thrustline, and the position of the horizontal tail surfaces on the empennage are factors in elevator effectiveness controlling pitch.Fon  

![](images/3e4bd8615709708ec1738cda112798d51a38e14786c548e6c44aec68a3c4815b.jpg)  
Figure6-1o.The elevator is the primary control for changing the pitch attitude of an aircraft.  

example, the horizontal tail surfaces may be attached near the lower part of the vertical stabilizer, at the midpoint, or at the high point, as in the T-tail design.  

# T-Tail  

In aT-tail configuration,the elevator is above most of the effects of downwash from the propeller, as well as airflow around the fuselage and/or wings during normal flight conditions.Operationof the elevators in this undisturbed air allows control movements that are consistent throughout most flight regimes. T-tail designs have become popular on many light and large aircraft, especially those with aft fuselage- mounted engines because the T-tail configuration removes thetailfrom the exhaust blast of the engines.Seaplanesand amphibians often have T-tails in order tokeep thehorizontal surfaces as far from the water as possible.Anadditional benefit is reduced noise and vibration inside the aircraft.  

In comparison with conventional-tail aircraft, the elevator on a T-tail aircraft must be moved a greater distance to raise the nose a given amount when traveling at slow speeds.Thisisbecause theconventional-tailaircrafthas the down wash from the propeller pushing down on the tail to assist in raising the nose.  

Aircraft controls are rigged so that an increase in control force is required to increase control travel.The forces required to raise the nose of aT-tail aircraft aregreater thantheforces required to raise the nose of a conventional-tailaircraft. Longitudinal stability of a trimmed aircraft is the same for both types of configuration,but the pilot must be aware that the required control forces are greater at slow speeds during takeoffs,landings,orstallsthanfor similar size aircraft equipped with conventional tails.  

T-tailaircraft also require additional design considerations to counter the problem of flutter.Since the weight of the horizontal surfaces is at the top of the vertical stabilizer,the moment arm created causes high loads on the vertical stabilizer that can result in flutter. Engineers must compensate for this by increasing the design stiffness of the vertical stabilizer, usually resultingin a weight penalty over conventional taildesigns  

When flying at a very high AOA with a low airspeed and an aft CG, the T-tail aircraft may be more susceptible to a deep stall. In this condition, the wake of the wing impinges on the tail surface and renders it almost ineffective.The wing, if fully stalled, allows its airflow to separate right after the leading edge. The wide wake of decelerated, turbulent air blankets the horizontal tail and hence its effectiveness diminished significantly. In these circumstances, elevator or stabilator control is reduced (or perhaps eliminated) making it difficult to recover from the stall.It should be noted that an aft CG is often a contributing factor in these incidents, since similar recovery problems are alsofound with conventional tail aircraft with a naft CG.[Figure6-11]Deepstallscan occur on any aircraft but are more likely to occur on aircraft with“T" tails as a high AOA may be more likely to place the wings separated airflow into the path of the horizontal surface of the tail.Additionally,the distance between the wings and the tail, the position of the engines (such as being mounted on the tail) may increase the susceptibility of deep stall events.Therefore a deep stall may be more prevalent on transportversusgeneral aviation aircraft.  

Since flight at a high AO A with a low airspeed and a naft CG position can be dangerous, many aircraft have systems to compensate for this situation. The systems range from control stops to elevator down springs. On transport category jets, stick pushers are commonly used.Anelevator downspring assists in lowering thenose of the aircraft toprevent astall caused by the aft CGposition.Thestall occurs because the properly trimmed airplane is flying with the elevator in a trailing edge down position,forcing the tail up and the nose down.In this unstable condition,ifthe aircraft encounters turbulence andslows down further, the trim tabnolonger positions the elevator in the nose- down position.The elevator then streamlines,and the nose of the aircraft pitches upward, possibly resulting in a stall.  

The elevator down spring produces a mechanical load on the elevator,causing it to move toward the nose-down position if not otherwise balanced.The elevator trim tab balances the elevator down spring to position the elevator in a trimmedposition. When the trim tab becomes ineffective,the down spring drives theelevator toanose-downposition.Thenoseof theaircraft lowers,speedbuildsup,and as tallis prevented.[Figure6-12]  

Theelevatormust also have sufficient authority to hold the nose of the aircraft up during the roundout for a landing. In this case, a forward CG may cause a problem. During the landing flare, power is usually reduced, which decreases the  

![](images/dc7bd7ca38e99db087f0a2b0515d3e909c03db84b95c13167812e67d017bc3a2.jpg)

air flow over the em penn age.This,coupled with the reduced landing speed,makes the elevator less effective.  

As this discussion demonstrates,pilots must understand and follow proper loading procedures, particularly with regard to the CG position. More information on aircraft loading, as well as weight and balance, is included in Chapter 10 Weight and Balance.  

# Stabilator  

As mentioned in Chapter 3,Aircraft Structure,astabilatoris essentiallyaone-piece horizontal stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point.When the control column is pulled back, it raises the stabilator's trailing edge, pulling the nose of theaircraft.Pushing the control column forward lowers the trailing edge of the stabilator and pitches the nose of the aircraftdown.  

Because stabilators pivot around a central hinge point, they are extremely sensitive to control inputs and aerodynamic loads.Antiservo tabs are incorporated on the trailing edge to decrease sensitivity.They deflect in the same direction as the stabilator.This results in an increase in the force required to move the stabilator, thus making it less prone to pilot-induced overcontrolling.Inaddition,a balance weight is usually incorporated in front of the main spar. The balance weight may project into the em penn age or maybe incorporated on the forward portion of thestabilator tips.[Figure6-13]  

# Canard  

The canard design utilizes the concept of two lifting surfaces. The canard functions asa horizontal stabilizer located in front  

![](images/4a74c56124fc073592402fd16e1bf06b2add2c63419075ed12b27fa8e33c7cf7.jpg)  
Figure6-13.The stab il at or is a one-piece horizontal tail surface that pivots up and down about a central hinge point.  

ofthemainwings.Ineffect,thecanardis an airfoil similar to the horizontal surface on a conventional aft-tail design. The difference is that the canard actually creates lift and holds the nose up, as opposed to the aft-tail design which exerts downward force on the tail to prevent the nose from rotating downward.[Figure6-14]  

Thecanarddesigndatesbacktothepioneerdaysof aviation Most notably, it was used on the Wright Flyer. Recently, the canard configuration has regained popularity and is appearing on newer aircraft. Canard designs include two types-one with a horizontal surface of about the same size as anormal aft-tail design, and the other with a surface of the same approximate sizeand airfoilof the aft-mounted wing known as a tandem wing configuration.Theoretically,the canard is considered more efficient because using thehorizontal surface tohelp lift the weight of the aircraft should result in less drag for a given amount of lift.  

![](images/fcf035f5fa272fd509568433f715696749b2eb57f4f1adfe3d421ab4bf724423.jpg)  
Figure6-14.The Piaggio P 180 includes a variable-sweepcanard design that provides longitudinal stability about the lateral axis.  

# Rudder  

The rudder controls movement ofthe aircraft about itsvertical axis. This motion is called yaw. Like the other primary control surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a fixed surface in this case,to the vertical stabilizer or fin.The rudder is controlled by theleft and right rudder pedals.  

When the rudder is deflected into the air flow,ahorizontal force is exerted in the opposite direction. [Figure 6-15] By pushing the left pedal,the rudder moves left.Thisaltersthe airflow around the vertical stabilizer/rudder and creates a sidewardlift that moves thetail to theright andyaws the nose of the airplane to the left.Rudder effectiveness increases with speed; therefore, large deflections at low speeds and small deflections at high speeds maybe required to provide the desiredreaction.Inpropeller-drivenaircraft,anyslipstream flowing over the rudder increases its effectiveness.  

# V-Tail  

TheV-tail design utilizes two slanted tail surfaces to perform the same functions as the surfaces of a conventional elevator andrudder configuration.Thefixed surfacesact asboth horizontal and vertical stabilizers.[Figure6-16]  

The movable surfaces,which are usually called ruddervators, are connected through a special linkage that allows the control wheel to move both surfaces simultaneously.Ontheother hand, displacement of the rudder pedals moves the surfaces differentially, thereby providing directional control.  

When both rudder and elevator controls are moved by the pilot,a control mixing mechanism moves each surface the  

![](images/33b6f63c5b2548bc71dd892f080ed0d65257c6fab22920ffd088c09804b4d250.jpg)

appropriate amount.The control system for the V-tailis more complex than the control systemfor a conventional tail.In addition, the V-tail design is more susceptible to Dutch roll tendencies than a conventional tail, and total reduction in drag is minimal.  

# Secondary Flight Controls  

Secondary flight control systems may consist of wing flaps. leading edge devices,spoilers,and trimsystems.  

# Flaps  

Flapsarethemost commonhigh-lift devices used on aircraft. These surfaces,which are attached to the trailing edge of the wing, increase both lift and induced drag for any given AOA.Flaps allow a compromise between high cruising speed andlowlanding speed because they may be extended when needed and retracted into the wing's structure when not needed. There are four common types of flaps: plain, split, slotted,andFowlerflaps.[Figure6-17]  

The plain flap is the simplest of the four types. It increases the airfoil camber,resulting in a significant increase in the coefficientoflift  $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$  atagivenAOA.Atthesametime,it greatlyincreasesdragandmovesthecenterofpressure(CP) aft on the airfoil,resultingin a nose-down pitching moment.  

The split flap is deflected from the lower surface of the airfoil and produces a slightly greater increase in lift than the plain flap.Moredragis created because of the turbulent airpattern produced behind the airfoil.Whenfully extended,both plain and split flaps produce high drag withlittle additional lift.  

The most popular flap on aircraft today is the slotted flap. Variations of this design are usedfor small aircraft, as well asforlargeones.Slotted flaps increase the lift coefficient significantly more thanplain or split flaps. On small aircraft, the hinge is located below thelower surface of theflap, and when the flap is lowered, a duct forms between the flap well in the wing and the leading edge of the flap. When the slotted flap is lowered, high energy air from the lower surface is ducted to the flap's upper surface. The high energy air from the slot accelerates the upper surface boundary layer and delays airflow separation, providing a higher  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  Thus,the slotted flap produces much greater increases in maximum coefficientoflift  $(\mathrm{C_{L-M A X}})$  than the plain or split flap. While there are many types of slotted flaps, large aircraft often havedouble-and even triple-slotted flaps.These allow the maximum increase in dragwithout the airflow over theflaps separating and destroying the lift they produce.  

![](images/aa383069115aef05f686e996f84027b15fbdcee2794976d2afd484a067b6dbb8.jpg)  
Figure6-17.Fivecommon typesof flaps  

Fowler flaps are a type of slotted flap. This flap design not only changes the camber of the wing, it also increases the wing area. Instead of rotating down on a hinge, it slides backwards on tracks. In the first portion of its extension, it increases the drag very little,but increases the lift a great deal as it increases both the area and camber.Pilotsshould be aware that flap extension may cause a nose-up or down pitchingmoment,dependingon thetypeof aircraft,which the pilot will need to compensate for,usually with a trim adjustment.As the extension continues,the flap deflects downward. During the last portion of its travel, the flap increases the dragwithlittle additional increaseinlift.  

# Leading Edge Devices  

High-liftdevices alsocanbe applied to theleadingedge of the airfoil. The most common types are fixed slots, movable slats,leading edge flaps,and cuffs.[Figure 6-18]  

Fixed slots direct air flow to the upper wing surface and delay air flow separation athigher angles of attack.Theslot does not  

![](images/6df07f03020ccff4b26d99558eac2ac17cf7c238accb43b9130a2b3f5a9680c0.jpg)  
Figure6-18.Leading edgehigh lift devices.  

increase the wing camber, but allows a higher maximum  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  because the stall is delayed until the wing reaches a greater AOA  

Movableslats consist of leading edge segments that move on tracks. At low angles of attack, each slat is held flush against the wing's leading edge by the high pressure that forms at the wing's leading edge. As the AOA increases, the high- pressure area moves aft below the lower surface of the wing allowing the slats to move forward. Some slats, however, are pilot operated and can be deployed at any AOA. Opening a slat allows the airbelow thewingtoflow over thewing's upper surface, delaying airflow separation.  

Leading edge flaps,like trailing edge flaps, are used to increaseboth  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  and the camber of the wings. This type of leading edge device is frequently used in conjunction with trailing edge flaps and can reduce the nose-down pitching movement produced by thelatter.As is true with trailingedge flaps, a small increment of leading edge flaps increases lift to a much greater extent than drag. As flaps are extended, drag increases at a greater rate than lift.  

Leading edge cuffs, like leading edge flaps and trailing edge flaps are used to increase both  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  and the camber of the wings. Unlike leading edge flaps and trailing edge flaps, leading edge cuffs are fixed aerodynamic devices.Inmost cases, leading edge cuffs extend the leading edge down and forward. This causes the airflow to attach better to the upper surface of the wing at higher angles of attack, thus lowering an aircraft's stall speed. The fixed nature ofleading edge cuffs extracts a penalty inmaximum cruise airspeed,butrecent advances in design and technology have reduced this penalty  

# Spoilers  

Found onsomefixed-wing aircraft,high drag devices called spoilers are deployed from the wings to spoil the smooth airflow,reducinglift and increasing drag. On gliders,spoilers are most often used to control rate of descent for accurate landings.On other aircraft,spoilers areoftenusedfor roll control,an advantage of which is the elimination of adverse yaw. To turn right, for example, the spoiler on the right wing is raised, destroying some of the lift and creating more drag on the right. The right wing drops, and the aircraft banks and yaws to the right. Deploying spoilers on both wings at the same time allows the aircraft to descend without gaining speed.Spoilersare alsodeployed to help reduce ground roll after landing. By destroying lift, they transfer weight to the wheels,improving braking effectiveness.[Figure6-19]  

# TrimSystems  

Although an aircraft can be operated throughout a widerange of attitudes, airspeeds, and power settings, it can be designed to fly hands-off within only a very limited combination of these  

![](images/5f23ff55e2d8db98d120cc61abe9bbe10ce0ac58f8a5d214a1b656310e80e25d.jpg)  
Figure6-19.Spoilers reduce lift and increase drag during descent andlanding.  

variables. Trim systems are used to relieve the pilot of the need to maintain constant pressure on the flight controls, and usually consist offlight deck controls and small hinged devices attached to the trailingedge of one or more of the primary flight controlsurfaces.Designed to help minimize a pilot'sworkload, trim systems aerodynamically assistmovement and position of the flight control surface to which they are attached.Common types of trim systems include trim tabs,balance tabs, antiservo tabs, ground adjustable tabs, and an adjustable stabilizer.  

# TrimTabs  

The most common installation on small aircraft is a single trim tab attached to the trailing edge of the elevator.Most trim tabs are manually operated by a small,vertically mounted control wheel. However, a trim crank may be found in some aircraft.The flight deck control includesa trim tabposition indicator.Placing thetrim control in thefullnose-down position moves the trim tab to its full up position.With thetrimtabupandintotheairstream,theairflowoverthe horizontal tail surface tends toforcethe trailingedge of the elevator down.This causes the tail of the aircraft to move up and thenose tomove down.[Figure6-20]  

If the trim tab is set to the full nose-up position,the tab moves to its full down position.Inthiscase,the air flowing under the horizontal tail surface hits the tab and forces the trailingedge of the elevator up,reducing the elevator'sAOA.This causes the tail of the aircraft to moved own and the nose to move up  

In spite of the opposing directional movement of the trim tab and the elevator,control of trim is natural to a pilot.If the pilot needs to exert constant back pressure on a control column, the need for nose-up trim is indicated. The normal trim procedure is to continue trimming until the aircraft is balanced and the nose-heavy condition is nolonger apparent. Pilots normally establish the desired power,pitchattitude. and configuration first,and then trim the aircraft to relieve  

![](images/053f07f2fbf901c777b69591a3f9eea31acb281c5b1ef5799681c289e5cc454c.jpg)

control pressures that may exist for that flight condition. As power, pitch attitude, or configuration changes, retrimming isnecessarytorelievethecontrolpressuresfor thenew flightcondition.  

# BalanceTabs  

The control forces maybe excessivelyhigh insome aircraft and,inorder todecreasethem,themanufacturermayuse balance tabs. They look like trim tabs and are hinged in approximately the same places as trim tabs. The essential difference between the twoisthat thebalancing tabiscoupled to the control surface rod so that when the primary control surface is moved in any direction,the tab automatically moves in the opposite direction. The airflow striking the tab counterbalances some of the air pressure against the primary controlsurfaceandenablesthepilottomovethecontrolmore easily andhold thecontrol surfacein position.  

If the linkage between the balance tab and thefixed surface is adjustable from the flight deck, the tab acts as a combination trim and balance tabthat can be adjusted to a desired deflection.  

# ServoTabs  

Servo tabs are very similar in operation and appearance to the trim tabs previously discussed.A servo tab is a small portion of a flight control surface that deploys in such away that it helps to move the entire flight control surface in the direction that the pilot wishes it to go.A servo tabis a dynamic device that deploys to decrease the pilotswork load and de-stabilize theaircraft.Servo tabs are sometimes referred to as flight tabs and are used primarily onlarge aircraft.They aid the pilot in moving the control surface and in holding it in the desired position.Only the servo tab moves in response to movement of the pilot's flight control, and the force of the airflow on theservo tab then moves the primary control surface.  

# AntiservoTabs  

Anti servo tabs work in the same manner as balance tabs except, instead of moving in the opposite direction, they move in the same direction as the trailing edge of the stabilator. In addition to decreasing the sensitivity of the stabilator, an anti servo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve control pressure and maintain the stab il at or in the desired position. The fixed end of the linkage is on the opposite side of the surface from the horn on the tab; when the trailing edge of the stabilator moves up, thelinkage forces the trailing edge of the tabup.When the stab il at or moves down,thetabalsomoves down.Conversely,trim tabs on elevators move opposite of the control surface.[Figure6-21]  

# Ground Adjustable Tabs  

Manysmall aircraft have a nonmovablemetal trim tab on the rudder. This tab is bent in one direction or the other while on theground to apply a trimforce totherudder.The correct displacement is determined by trial and error. Usually, small

Figure6-21.An anti servo tab attempts to streamline the control surface and is used to make the stab il at or less sensitive by opposing theforceexertedbythepilot  

adjustments are necessary until the aircraft no longer skids left or right during normal cruising flight.[Figure 6-22]  

# Adjustable Stabilizer  

Rather than using a movable tab on the trailing edge of the elevator, some aircraft have an adjustable stabilizer.With this arrangement, linkages pivot the horizontal stabilizer about its rear spar. This is accomplished by the use of a jackscrew mounted on the leading edge of the stab il at or.[Figure6-23/ On small aircraft, the jackscrew is cable operated with a trim wheel or crank.Onlarger aircraft, it is motor driven.The trimming effect and flight deck indications for an adjustable stabilizeraresimilartothoseofatrimtab.  

# Autopilot  

Autopilot is an automatic flight control system that keeps an aircraft in level flight or on a set course.It can be directed by the pilot, or it may be coupled to a radio navigation signal. Autopilot reduces the physical and mental demands on a pilot and increases safety.The common features available on an autopilotarealtitudeandheadinghold  

The simplest systems use gyroscopic attitude indicators and magnetic compasses to control servos connected to the flight control system.[Figure 6-24] The number and location of these servos depends on the complexity of the system.For example, a single-axis autopilot controls the aircraft about the longitudinal axis and aservo actuatesthe ailerons.Athree-axis autopilot controls the aircraft about thelongitudinal,lateral,and verticalaxes.Three different servos actuate ailerons,elevator, and rudder. More advanced systems often include a vertical speed and/orindicated airspeed hold mode.Advanced autopilot systems are coupled to navigational aids through a flight director

Figure6-23.Someaircraft,including most jet transports,usean adjustable stabilizer to provide the required pitch trim forces  

The autopilot system also incorporates a disconnect safety feature to disengage the system automatically or manually. These autopilots work with inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems (GPS),and flight computers to control the aircraft. In fly-by-wire systems, the autopilot is an integrated component.  

Additionally, autopilots can be manually overridden.Because autopilot systems differ widely in their operation,refer to the autopilot operating instructions in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) or the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).  

# Chapter Summary  

Because flight control systems and aerodynamic characteristics vary greatly between aircraft, it is essential that a pilot becomefamiliar with the primary andsecondary flight control systems of the aircraft being flown.The primarysourceof this information is theAFM or thePOH. Various manufacturer and owner group websites can alsobe avaluablesource of additional information.

# Chapter  

# Aircraft Systems  

# Introduction  

This chapter covers the primary systems found on most aircraft. These include the engine, propeller, induction, ignition, as well as the fuel, lubrication, cooling, electrical, landing gear, and environmental control systems.  

# Powerplant  

An aircraft engine, or powerplant, produces thrust to propel an aircraft. Reciprocating engines and turboprop engines work in combination with a propeller to produce thrust. Turbojet and turbofan engines produce thrust by increasing the velocity of air flowing through the engine. All of these powerplants also drive the various systems that support the operation of an aircraft.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

Most small aircraft are designed with reciprocating engines. The name is derived from the back-and-forth,or reciprocating,movementof thepistons thatproduces the mechanical energy necessary to accomplish work.  

Driven by a revitalization of the general aviation(GA) industry and advances in both material and engine design, reciprocating engine technologyhas improved dramatically over the past two decades.The integration of computerized engine management systems has improved fuel efficiency, decreased emissions,and reduced pilot workload.  

Reciprocating engines operate on thebasic principle of converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy. This conversion occurs within the cylinders of the engine through the process of combustion.The two primary reciprocating engine designs are the spark ignition and the compression ignition. The spark ignition reciprocating engine hasserved as thepowerplant of choice for many years.In an effort toreduce operating costs,simplifydesign,and improve reliability, several engine manufacturers are turning to compression ignition as a viable alternative. Often referred to as jet fuel piston engines,compression ignition engines have the added advantage of utilizing readily available and lower cost diesel or jet fuel.  

The main mechanical components of the spark ignition and the compression ignition engine are essentially the same. Both use cylindrical combustion chambers andpistons that travel the length of the cylinders to convert linear motion into the rotary motion of the crankshaft. The main difference between spark ignition and compression ignition isthe process of igniting the fuel. Spark ignition engines use a spark plug to ignite a pre-mixed fuel-air mixture.(Fuel-air mixture is the ratio of the “weight" of fuel to the "weight' of air in the mixture to be burned.) A compression ignition engine first compresses the air in the cylinder, raising its temperature to a degree necessary for automatic ignition whenfuelis injected intothecylinder.  

These two engine designs can be further classified as:  

1。 Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft radial, in-line, v-type, or opposed 2. Operating cycletwo or four 3.1 Method of cooling—liquid or air  

Radial engines were widely used during WorldWar I and many are still in service today.With these engines,arowor rows of cylinders are arranged in a circular pattern around the crankcase. The main advantage of a radial engine is the favorablepower-to-weightratio.[Figure7-1]

Figure7-1.Radialengine  

In-line engines have a comparatively small frontal area, but their power-to-weight ratios are relatively low. In addition, the rearmost cylinders of an air-cooled,in-line engine receive very little cooling air, so these engines are normally limited to four or six cylinders. V-type engines provide more horsepower than in-line engines and still retain a small frontalarea.  

Continued improvements in engine design led to the development of the horizontally-opposed engine, which remains the most popular reciprocating engines used on smaller aircraft. These engines always have an even number of cylinders, since a cylinder on one side of the crankcase opposes”a cylinder on the other side.[Figure 7-2] The majority of these engines are air cooled and usually are mounted in a horizontal position when installed on fixed-wing airplanes. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight ratiosbecause theyhave a comparatively small,lightweight crankcase.In addition, the compact cylinder arrangement reduces the engine's frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag.

Figure7-2.Horizontally opposed engine.  

Depending on the engine manufacturer, all of these arrangements can be designed to utilize spark or compression ignition and operate on either a two- or four-stroke cycle  

In a two-stroke engine, the conversion of chemical energy intomechanical energy occurs over a two-stroke operating cycle. The intake, compression, power, and exhaust processes occur in only two strokes of the piston rather than the more common four strokes.Becauseatwo-strokeenginehas a power stroke upon each revolution of the crankshaft,it typically has higher power-to-weight ratio than a comparable four-stroke engine.Due tothe inherent inefficiency and disproportionate emissions of the earliest designs,use of the two-stroke engine has been limited in aviation  

Recentadvancesinmaterialandenginedesignhave reduced many of the negative characteristics associated withtwo-strokeengines.Moderntwo-stroke engines often use conventional oil sumps, oil pumps, and full pressure fed lubrication systems. The use of direct fuel injection and pressurized air, characteristic of advanced compression ignition engines, make two-stroke compression ignition engines aviable alternativeto themore commonfour-stroke sparkignition designs.[Figure7-3]  

Spark ignitionfour-stroke engines remain the most common design used in GA today. [Figure 7-4] The main parts of a spark ignition reciprocating engine include the cylinders, crankcase, and accessory housing. The intake/exhaust valves, spark plugs, and pistons are located in the cylinders. The crankshaft and connecting rods arelocatedin the crankcase. The magnetos are normallylocated on the engine accessory housing.

Figure7-4.Main components of as park ignition reciprocating engine.  

Inafour-stroke engine,the conversionof chemical energy into mechanical energy occurs over a four-stroke operating cycle The intake, compression, power, and exhaust processes occur in four separate strokes of thepiston in thefollowing order.  

1.The intake stroke begins as the piston starts its downward travel.When thishappens,the intake valve opens and the fuel-air mixture is drawn into the cylinder. 2 The compression strokebegins when theintake valve closes, and the piston starts moving back to the top of thecylinder.Thisphaseofthecycleisusedtoobtain a much greater power output from the fuel-air mixture once it is ignited. 3. The power stroke begins when the fuel-air mixture is ignited. This causes a tremendous pressure increase in the cylinder and forces the piston downward away from the cylinder head, creating the power that turns thecrankshaft.  

4. The exhaust stroke is used to purge the cylinder of burnedgases.It begins when the exhaust valve opens, and the piston starts to move toward thecylinderhead onceagain.  

Even when the engine is operate data fairly low speed the four-stroke cycle takes place several hundred times eachminute.[Figure  $7–5J$  In a four-cylinder engine,each cylinder operates on a different stroke.Continuous rotation of a crankshaft is maintained by the precise timing of the power strokes in each cylinder.Continuous operation of the engine depends on the simultaneous function of auxiliary systems, including the induction, ignition, fuel, oil, cooling and exhaust systems.  

The latest advance in aircraft reciprocating engines was pioneered in the mid-1960s by Frank Thielert, who looked to the automotive industry for answers on how to integrate diesel technology into an aircraft engine.The advantage  

![](images/17c7d7dfb198f53a49043c8a89b41f0fe0ea430fbd54da3093ddaa62d7940836.jpg)  
Figure7-5.The arrows in this illustration indicate the direction of motion of the crankshaft and piston during the four-strokecycle  

of a diesel-fueled reciprocating engine lies in the physical similarity of diesel and kerosene. Aircraft equipped with a diesel piston engine runs onstandard aviationfuel kerosene, which provides more independence, higher reliability, lower consumption,and operational cost saving  

In 1999, Thielert formed Thielert Aircraft Engines (TAE) to design, develop, certify, and manufacture a brand-new Jet-A-burning diesel cycle engine (also known as jet-fueled piston engine) for the GA industry. By March 2001, the first prototype engine became the first certified diesel engine since World War HI. TAE continues to design and develop diesel cycle engines and other engine manufacturers, such as Societe deMotorisationsAeronautiques (SMA),nowoffer jet-fueled piston engines as well. TAE engines can be found on the Diamond DA40 single and the DA42 Twin Star; the first diesel engine tobepart of the type certificate of a new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) aircraft.  

These engines have also gained a toehold in the retrofit market with a supplemental type certificate (STC) to re- engine the Cessna 172 models and the Piper PA-28family. The jet-fueled piston engine's technology has continued to progress and a full authority digital engine control (FADEC, discussed more fullylater in the chapter)is standard on such equipped aircraft, which minimizes complication of engine control.By2007,variousjet-fueled piston aircraft had logged wellover600,000 hours of service.  

# Propeller  

The propeller is a rotating airfoil, subject to induced drag, stalls, and other aerodynamic principles that apply to any airfoil. It provides the necessary thrust to pull, or in some cases push, the aircraft through the air. The engine power is used to rotate the propeller, which in turn generates thrust very similar to the manner in which a wing produces lift. The amountof thrust produced depends on the shape of the airfoil, the angle of attack (AOA) of the propeller blade, and the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the engine. The propeller itself is twistedso theblade angle changes from hub to tip The greatest angle of incidence, or the highest pitch, is at the hub while the smallest angle of incidence or smallest pitch is at the tip.[Figure7-6]  

The reason for the twist is to produce uniform lift from the hub to the tip. As the blade rotates, there is a difference in the actual speed of the various portions of theblade. The tip of the blade travels faster than the part near the hub,because the tip travels a greater distance than the hub in the same length of time. [Figure 7-7] Changing the angle ofincidence (pitch)from the hub to the tip to correspond with the speed produces uniform lift throughout the length of the blade. A propeller blade designed with the same angle of incidence  

![](images/88558f616fbf95b652cf08b129c440f57fba604f5a9906d8d37e87e1875900a2.jpg)  
Figure7-6.Changes in propeller blade angle from hub to tip  

throughout its entire length would be inefficient because as airspeed increases in flight, the portion near the hub would have a negative AO A while the blade tip would be stalled. Small aircraft are equipped with either one of two types of propellers:fixed-pitch or adjustable-pitch  

# Fixed-PitchPropeller  

A propeller with fixed blade anglesis afixed-pitchpropeller The pitch of this propeller is set by the manufacturer and cannotbechanged.Sinceafixed-pitch propeller achieves the best efficiency only at a given combination of airspeed and rpm, the pitch setting is ideal for neither cruise nor climb. Thus, the aircraft suffers a bit in each performance category.Thefixed-pitch propeller is used when low weight simplicity,and low cost are needed.  

There are two types of fixed-pitch propellers: climb and cruise. Whether the airplane has a climb or cruise propeller  

![](images/d4fd6a65c2458f0a9186ba2deaaee51f5d22d2f4b6ee078c54d75896430df5dc.jpg)  
Figure7-7.Relationship of travel distance and speed of various portions of propeller blade.  

installed dependsuponitsintendeduse.Theclimbpropeller has a lower pitch, therefore less drag. Less drag results in higher rpm and more horsepower capability,whichincreases performance during takeoffs and climbs but decreases performance during cruising flight  

The cruise propeller has a higher pitch, therefore more drag. More drag results in lower rpm and less horsepower capability,which decreases performance during takeoffs and climbs but increases efficiency during cruising flight  

The propeller is usually mounted on a shaft,whichmay be an extension of the engine crankshaft.Inthiscase,therpm of the propeller would be the same as the crankshaft rpm. On someengines,thepropelleris mounted on a shaftgeared to the engine crankshaft. In this type, the rpm of the propeller is different than that of the engine.  

In a fixed-pitch propeller, the tachometer is the indicator of engine power.[Figure 7-8] A tachometer is calibrated in hundreds of rpm and gives a direct indication of the engine and propeller rpm. The instrument is color coded with a green arc denoting the maximum continuous operating rpm. Some tachometers have additional markings toreflect engine and/or propeller limitations. The manufacturer's recommendations should be used as a reference to clarify any misunderstanding of tachometer markings.  

The rpm is regulated by the throttle, which controls the fuel- air flow to the engine. At a given altitude, the higher the tachometer reading, the higher the power output of the engine.  

When operating altitude increases, the tachometer may not show correct power output of the engine.For example, 2,300 rpm at5,oo 0 feet produces less horsepower than  $2{,}300\,\mathrm{rpm}$  at sea level because power output depends on air density. Air densitydecreasesasaltitudeincreasesandadecreaseinair

Figure7-8.Engine rpm is indicated on the tachometer.  

density (higher density altitude) decreases the power output of the engine.As altitude changes,the position of the throttle must be changed to maintain the same rpm.Asaltitudeis increased,the throttle must be opened further to indicate the same rpm as at a lower altitude.  

# Adjustable-PitchPropeller  

The adjustable-pitch propeller was the forerunner of the constant-speedpropeller.It is a propeller with blades whose pitch can be adjusted on the ground with the engine not running,but which cannot be adjusted in flight.It isalso referred to as a ground adjustable propeller. By the 1930s. pioneer aviation inventors were laying the ground work for automatic pitch-change mechanisms, which is why the term sometimes refers to modern constant-speed propellers that are adjustable in flight  

Thefirst adjustable-pitch propeller systems provided only two pitch settings: low and high. Today, most adjustable-pitch propeller systems are capable of a range of pitch settings.  

A constant-speed propeller is a controllable-pitchpropeller whosepitch is automatically varied in flight by a governor maintaining constant rpm despitevarying airloads.Itis the most common type of adjustable-pitch propeller. The main advantage of a constant-speed propeller is that it converts a high percentage of brake horsepower(BHP)into thrust horsepower (THP) over a wide range of rpm and airspeed combinations. A constant-speed propeller is more efficient than other propellers becauseit allows selection of themost efficient engine rpm for the given conditions.  

An aircraft with a constant-speed propeller has two controls: the throttle andthepropeller control.The throttle controls power output, and the propeller control regulates engine rpm.This regulates propeller rpm,which is registered on thetachometer.  

Once a specific rpm is selected,a governor automatically adjusts the propeller blade angle as necessary to maintain the selected rpm. For example, after setting the desired rpm during cruisingflight, an increasein airspeed or decrease in propeller load causes the propeller blade angle to increase as necessary to maintain the selected rpm.A reduction in airspeed or increase in propeller load causes the propeller blade angle to decrease.  

The propeller's constant-speed range, defined by the high and low pitch stops, is the range of possible blade angles for a constant-speed propeller. As long as the propeller blade angle is within the constant-speed range and not against either pitch stop, a constant engine rpm is maintained. If the propeller blades contact a pitch stop, the engine rpm will increase or decrease as appropriate, with changes in airspeed and propeller load.Forexample,oncea specific rpm hasbeen selected,if aircraft speed decreases enough to rotate the propeller blades until they contact the low pitch stop, anyfurther decreasein airspeedwill cause engine rpm to decrease the same way as if afixed-pitch propeller were installed. The same holds true when an aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller accelerates to a faster airspeed.As the aircraft accelerates, the propeller blade angleincreases to maintain the selected rpm until thehigh pitch stopis reached. Once this occurs,theblade angle cannotincrease anyfurther and engine rpm increases.  

On aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller, power output is controlled by the throttle and indicated by a manifold pressuregauge.The gauge measures the absolute pressure of thefuel-air mixture inside the in take manifold and is more correctly a measure of manifold absolute pressure(MAP).At a constant rpm and altitude,the amount of power produced is directly related to the fuel-air mixture being delivered to the combustion chamber.As the throttle setting is increased, more fuel and air flows to the engine and MAP increases. When the engine is not running, the manifold pressure gauge indicates ambient air pressure (i.e.,29.92 inches mercury  $(29.92\ ^{"}\mathrm{Hg})_{\rightmoon}$  ).Whentheengineisstarted,themanifold pressure indication decreases to a valueless than ambient pressure (i.e., idle at  $12\ "\mathrm{Hg},$  0.Engine failure or power loss is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase in manifold pressuretoavaluecorrespondingtothe ambientairpressure at the altitude where the failure occurred.[Figure7-9]  

The manifold pressure gauge is color coded to indicate the engine's operating range. The face of the manifold pressure gauge contains a green arc to show the normal operating range and a red radial line to indicate the upper limit of manifold pressure.  

![](images/175bb8b7d8c84bd5cc662aad09d9a3995bed8e57f6104c92d1c620e296abf0d3.jpg)  
Figure7-9.Enginepower output is indicated on themanifold pressuregauge.  

For any given rpm, there is a manifold pressure that should notbeexceeded.If manifold pressure is excessive for a given rpm,thepressurewithinthecylinderscouldbeexceeded, placing undue stress on the cylinders.Ifrepeatedtoo frequently,this stress can weaken the cylinder components and eventually cause engine failure.  

A pilot can avoid conditions that over stress the cylinders by being constantly aware of the rpm,especially when increasing the manifold pressure. Consult the manufacturer's recommendations for power settings ofaparticular engine to maintain the proper relationship between manifold pressure andrpm.  

Whenboth manifold pressure and rpmneed tobe changed avoid engine overstress by making power adjustments in theproperorder:  

When power settings are being decreased, reduce manifold pressure before reducing rpm. If rpm is reduced before manifold pressure, manifold pressure automatically increases, possibly exceeding the manufacturer'stolerances. Whenpower settings are beingincreased,reverse the order—increase rpm first, then manifold pressure. To prevent damage to radial engines, minimize operating time at maximum rpmand manifold pressure, and avoid operation at maximum rpm and low manifold pressure.  

The engine and/or airframe manufacturer's recommendations should be followed to prevent severe wear, fatigue, and damagetohigh-performance reciprocating engines.  

# Propeller Overspeed in Piston Engine Aircraft  

OnMarch17,2010,the Federal Aviation Administration

 (FAA) issued Special Air worthiness Information Bulletin

 (SAIB) CE-10-21. The subject was Propellers/Propulsers; Propeller Overspeed in Piston Engine Aircraft to alert operators, pilots, and aircraft manufacturers of concerns for an optimum response to a propeller overspeed in piston engine aircraft with variable pitch propellers. Although a SAIBis not regulatory in nature,the FAA recommends that the information be read and taken into consideration for the safetyofflight.  

The document explains that a single-engineaircraft experienced a propeller over speed during cruise flight at 7,00ofeet. The pilot reported that the application of throttle resulted in a propeller overspeed with no appreciable thrust. The pilot attempted to glide to a nearby airport and established the"bestglide”speedof110knots,as published in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), but was unable to reach the airport andwasforced toconductanoff-fieldlanding  

It was further explained that a determination was made that the propeller experienced afailurecausing the blade pitch change mechanism to move to the low pitch stop position.Thiscaused the propeller to operate as afixed-pitch propeller such that it changes rpm with changes in power and airspeed. The low pitchsettingallowsformaximumpowerduringtakeoffbut can result in a propeller overspeed at a higher airspeed.  

A performance evaluation of theflight conditionwas performed for the particular aircraft model involved in this incident. This evaluation indicated that an airspeed lower than the best glide speed would have resulted in increased thrust enabling the pilot to maintain level flight. There are numerous variables in aircraft, engines, and propellers that affect aircraft performance. For some aircraft models. the published best glide speed may not below enough to generate adequate thrustfor a given propeller installation in this situation (propeller blades at low pitch stop position).  

The operators of aircraft with variable pitch propellers should be aware that in certain instances of propeller over speed,the airspeed necessary tomaintainlevel flightmaybe different than the speed associated with engine-out best glide speed. The appropriate emergency procedures should be followed to mitigate the emergency situation in the event of a propeller overspeed;however,pilots should be aware that some reductionin airspeed mayresult in the ability for continued safe flight andlanding. The determination of an airspeed that is moresuitable than engine-out best glide speed should only be conducted at a safe altitude when the pilot has time to determine an alternative course of action other than landing immediately.  

# Induction Systems  

The induction system brings in air from the outside, mixes it with fuel, and delivers the fuel-air mixture to the cylinder where combustion occurs.Outside air enters the induction system through an intake port on the front of the engine cowling. This port normally contains an air filter that inhibits theentryofdustandotherforeignobjects.Sincethefilter may occasionally become clogged,an alternate source of air mustbe available.Usually,the alternate air comesfrominside the engine cowling, where it bypasses a clogged air filter.Some alternate air sources function automatically. while others operate manually  

Two types of induction systems are commonly used in smal aircraftengines:  

1.The carburetor system mixes the fuel and air in the carburetor before this mixture enters the in take manifold. 2. The fuel injection system mixes the fuel and air immediately before entry into each cylinder or injects fuel directly into each cylinder.  

# Carburetor Systems  

Aircraftcarburetorsareseparatedintotwocategories:float- type carburetors and pressure-type carburetors. Float-type carburetors,complete with idling,accelerating,mixture control,idlecutoff,and power enrichment systems,arethe most common of the two carburetor types.Pressure-type carburetors are usually not found on small aircraft.Thebasic difference between afloat-type anda pressure-typecarburetor is the delivery of fuel.Thepressure-typecarburetor delivers fuel under pressure by a fuel pump.  

In the operation of thefloat-type carburetor system,the outside air first flows through an air filter, usually located at an air intake in thefront part of the engine cowling. This filtered air flows into the carburetor and through aventuri, a narrow throat in the carburetor. When the air flows through theventuri,a low-pressure area is created that forces the fuel to flow through a main fuel jetlocated at the throat. The fuel then flows into the air stream where it is mixed with the flowing air.[Figure7-10]  

The fuel-air mixture is then drawn through the intake manifold and into the combustion chambers where it is ignited. The float-type carburetor acquires its name from a float that rests on fuel within the float chamber.A needle attached tothe float opensand closes an opening at the bottom of the carburetor bowl. This meters the amount of fuel entering into the carburetor, depending upon the position of the float, which is controlled by the level of fuel in the floatchamber.When the level of the fuel forces the float to rise, the needle valve closes the fuel opening and shuts off the fuel flow to the carburetor. The needle valve opens again when the engine requires additional fuel. The flow of the fuel-air mixture to the combustion chambers is regulated by the throttle valve,whichis controlled bythethrottlein theflightdeck  

Thefloat-type carburetor has several distinct disadvantages. First, they do not function well during abrupt maneuvers. Secondly,the discharge of fuel at low pressure leads to incomplete vaporization and difficulty in discharging fuel into some types of supercharged systems. The chief disadvantage of the float-type carburetor, however, is its icingtendency.Since thefloat-typecarburetor must discharge  

![](images/506a604af12a8880b261eaaa998343a36c3e6de8101bb6bbbdb71cc28fa89f85.jpg)  
Figure7-1o.Float-typecarburetor  

fuel at a point of low pressure,the discharge nozzle must be located at the venturi throat,and the throttle valve must be on the engine side of the discharge nozzle.Thismeans that the dropin temperature due to fuel vaporization takesplace within the venturi.As aresult,ice readily forms in the venturi and on the throttle valve.  

A pressure-type carburetor discharges fuel into the airstream at a pressure well above atmospheric pressure. This results in better vaporization and permits the discharge of fuel into the airstream on the engine side of the throttle valve.With the discharge nozzle in this position fuel vaporization takes place after the air haspassed through the throttlevalve and at a point where thedropin temperatureis offset byheatfrom the engine. Thus, the danger of fuel vaporization icing is practically eliminated. The effects of rapid maneuvers and rough air on the pressure-type carburetors are negligible, since their fuel chambers remainfilled under all operating conditions.  

# MixtureControl  

Carburetors are normally calibrated at sea-level air pressure where thecorrectfuel-air mixtureratiois established with the mixture control set in the FULL RICH position. However, as altitude increases, the density of air entering the carburetor decreases,while the density of the fuel remains the same.This creates a progressively richer mixture that can result in engine roughnessand an appreciable loss of power.Theroughness normally is due to spark plug fouling from excessive carbon buildup on the plugs. Carbon buildup occurs because the rich mixture lowers the temperature inside the cylinder, inhibiting complete combustion of thefuel. This condition may occur during the runup prior to takeoff at high-elevation airports and during climbs or cruise flight at high altitudes. To maintain the correct fuel-air mixture, the mixture must be leaned using the mixture control.Leaning the mixture decreases fuel flow, which compensates for the decreased air density at high altitude.  

During a descent from high altitude, the fuel-air mixture mustbeenriched,orit may become toole an.Anoverlylean mixture causes detonation,which may result in rough engine operation,overheating,and/oralossofpower.Thebestway to maintain the proper fuel-air mixture is to monitor the engine temperature and enrich the mixture as needed.Proper mixture control and better fuel economy for fuel-injected engines can be achieved by using an exhaust gas temperature (EGT)gauge.Since the process of adjusting the mixture can vary from one aircraft to another, it is important to refer to the airplane flight manual (AFM) or the POH to determine the specific procedures for a given aircraft.  

# CarburetorIcing  

As mentioned earlier,one disadvantage of thefloat-type carburetor is its icing tendency.Carburetor ice occurs due totheeffectoffuelvaporizationandthedecreaseinair pressure in the venturi, which causes a sharp temperature drop in the carburetor.If water vapor in the air condenses when the carburetor temperature is at or below freezing, ice may form on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including the throttle valve.[Figure7-11]  

The reduced air pressure, as well as the vaporization of fuel, contributes to the temperature decrease in the carburetor.Ice generally forms in the vicinity of the throttle valve and in the venturi throat.Thisrestricts the flow of thefuel-air mixture and reduces power. If enough ice builds up, the engine may ceasetooperate.Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when temperaturesarebelow7OdegreesFahrenheit  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  0r21 degreesCelsius  ${}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and the relative humidity is above80 percent.Due to the sudden cooling that takes place in the carburetor,icingcan occur evenin outside air temperatures ashighas  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\,(38\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and humidity as low as 50 percent. This temperature drop can be as much as 60 to 70 absolute (versus relative)Fahrenheit degrees  $(70\mathrm{~x~}100/180=38.89$  

![](images/9ec2933c378dda64e8432476adfcaf1359288f0f9635014a833422362fdcf68b.jpg)  
Figure7-11.The formation of carburetor ice may reduce or block fuel-air flow to the engine.  

Celsiusdegrees)(Remember there are 180 Fahrenheit degrees from freezing to boiling versus 1o0 degrees for the Celsius scale.) Therefore, an outside air temperature of  $100\,\mathrm{F}\left(38\,\mathrm{C}\right)$  a temperature drop of an absolute  $70\,\mathrm{F}$  degrees(38.89Celsius degrees)resultsin an air temperaturein thecarburetor of 30 F (-1 C). [Figure 7-12]  

The first indication of carburetor icing in an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller is a decrease in engine rpm, which may be followed by engine roughness. In an aircraft with a constant-speed propeller, carburetoricing is usually indicated by a decrease in manifold pressure, but no reduction in rpm. Propeller pitchis automatically adjusted to compensatefor loss of power. Thus, a constant rpm is maintained. Although carburetor ice can occur during any phase of flight, it is particularly dangerous when using reduced power during a descent. Under certain conditions, carburetorice could build unnoticed until power is added.To combat the effects off carburetorice,engines with float-type carburetors employ a carburetor heat system.  

# Carburetor Heat  

Carburetor heat is an anti-icing system that preheats the air before it reaches the carburetor and is intended to keep the fuel-air mixture abovefreezing to prevent the formation of carburetorice.Carburetor heat can be used to melt ice that has alreadyformedinthecarburetoriftheaccumulationisnottoo great,butusing carburetorheat as a preventative measure is the better option. Additionally, carburetor heat may be used as an alternate air source if the intake filter clogs, such as in sudden or unexpected airframe icing conditions. The carburetor heat should be checked during the engine runup. When using carburetorheat,follow the manufacturer's recommendations.  

When conditions are conducive to carburetor icing during flight,periodic checks should be madetodetect its  

![](images/b9a343888cba95108da368692b4d71e6702f7ebfaac67de841332f03015a4c61.jpg)  
Figure7-12.Although carburetor ice is most likely to form when thetemperatureandhumidityareinrangesindicatedbythischart, carburetor icing is possible under conditions not depicted.  

presence. If detected, full carburetor heat should be applied immediately,and it should be left in the ON position until the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed.Ifice is present,applying partial heat or leavingheat onfor an insufficient time might aggravate the situation.In extreme cases of carburetoricing, even after the ice has been removed, full carburetor heat should be used to prevent further ice formation.If installed, a carburetor temperature gauge is useful in determining when to use carburetor heat.  

Whenever the throttle is closed during flight, the engine cools rapidly andvaporization of thefuel isless completethan if theengineiswarm.Also,inthis condition,theengineismore susceptible to carburetoricing. If carburetor icing conditions aresuspected andclosed-throttle operation anticipated,adjust the carburetor heat to thefull ONposition before closing the throttle and leave it on during the closed-throttle operation. The heat aids in vaporizing the fuel and helps prevent the formation of carburetor ice.Periodically,open the throttle smoothly for a few seconds to keep the engine warm; otherwise, the carburetor heater may not provide enough heat to prevent icing.  

Theuseofcarburetorheatcausesadecreaseinengine power, sometimes up to 15 percent, because the heated air is less dense than the outside air that had been entering the engine.This enriches the mixture.When ice is present in an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller and carburetor heat is being used, there is a decrease in rpm, followed by a gradual increase in rpm as the ice melts.The engine also should run more smoothly after the ice has been removed. If ice is not present, the rpm decreases and then remains constant.When carburetor heat isused on an aircraftwith a constant-speed propeller andiceispresent,a decreaseinthe manifold pressure is noticed,followed by a gradual increase. If carburetor icing is not present, the gradual increase in manifold pressure is not apparent until the carburetor heat isturnedoff  

It isimperativefor a pilot to recognize carburetor ice when it forms during flight to prevent aloss in power, altitude, and/or airspeed.These symptoms may sometimes be accompanied by vibration or engine roughness. Once a power loss is noticed,immediate action should be taken to eliminate ice alreadyformedinthecarburetorandtopreventfurtherice formation. This is accomplished by applying full carburetor heat,which will further reduce power and may cause engine roughness as melted ice goes through the engine.These symptomsmaylast from 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on the severity of the icing. During this period, the pilot must resist the temptation to decrease the carburetor heat usage.Carburetor heat must remainin thefull-hotposition until normal power returns.  

Since the use of carburetor he attends to reduce the output of the engine and to increase the operating temperature. carburetor heat should not be used when full power is required (as during takeoff) or during normal engine operation, except to checkfor the presence of,or to remove,carburetorice.  

# Carburetor Air Temperature Gauge  

Some aircraft are equipped with a carburetor air temperature gauge, which is useful in detecting potential icing conditions. Usually,theface of thegauge is calibrated in degrees Celsius with a yellow arc indicating the carburetor air temperatures where icing may occur. This yellow arc typically ranges between  $-15\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $+5\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $5\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  and  $41\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}_{c}$  0.If theair temperature and moisture content of the air are such that carburetor icing is improbable,theenginecanbe operated with the indicatorin theyellow rangewith no adverse effects. If the atmospheric conditions are conducive to carburetor icing,the indicator must bekept outside the yellow arc by application of carburetorheat.  

Certain carburetor air temperature gauges have a redradial that indicates the maximum permissible carburetor inlet air temperature recommended by the engine manufacturer.If present, a green arc indicates the normal operating range.  

# Outside Air Temperature Gauge  

Most aircraft are also equipped with an outside air temperature(OAT）gauge calibrated in both degrees CelsiusandFahrenheit.Itprovidesthe outsideor ambient air temperaturefor calculatingtrue airspeed andisusefulin detecting potential icing conditions.  

# Fuel Injection Systems  

In afuel injectionsystem,thefuel is injected directly into thecylinders,or just ahead of the in take valve.Theair in take for the fuel injection system is similar to that used in a carburetor system,with an alternate air source located within the engine cowling.This source is used if the external air source is obstructed.The alternate air source is usually operated automatically,with a backup manual system that can be used if the automatic feature malfunctions.  

Afuel injection system usually incorporates six basic components:anengine-drivenfuel pump,a fuel-air control unit, a fuel manifold (fuel distributor),discharge nozzles. an auxiliary fuel pump, and fuel pressure/flow indicators. [Figure7-13]  

The auxiliaryfuel pump provides fuel under pressureto the fuel-air control unit for engine starting and/or emergency use.After starting,the engine-driven fuel pump providesfuel under pressure from the fuel tank to the fuel-air control unit  

Thiscontrolunit,which essentially replaces the carburetor, meters fuel based on the mixture control setting and sends it tothefuel manifold valve at a ratecontrolled bythethrottle.  

![](images/098ad38c7f32e6db3f0183fce123bbe8e63bc643e10a12d3b3b83e946f2647ef.jpg)  
Figure 7-13.Fuel injection system.  

After reaching thefuel manifold valve, the fuelis distributed to the individual fuel discharge nozzles.Thedischarge nozzles,which arelocated in each cylinder head,inject the fuel-air mixture directly into each cylinder intake port.  

A fuel injection system is considered tobeless susceptible to icing than a carburetor system, but impact icing on the air intake is a possibility in either system. Impact icing occurs when ice forms on the exterior of the aircraft and blocks openings,such as the air in take for the injection system.  

The following are advantages of using fuel injection:  

Reduction in evaporative icing Betterfuel flow Faster throttle response Precise control of mixture Better fuel distribution Easier coldweatherstarts  

The following are disadvantages of using fuel injection:  

Difficultyin startinga hot engine Vapor locks during ground operations on hot days Problems associated with restarting an engine that quits because of fuel starvation  

# Superchargers and Turbosupercharger s  

To increase an engine'shorsepower,manufacturers have developed forced induction systems called supercharger and turbosupercharger systems. They both compress the intakeair to increase its density.The key difference lies in the power supply. A supercharger relies on an engine-driven air pump or compressor, while a turbocharger gets its power from the exhaust stream that runs through a turbine, which in turn spins the compressor.Aircraftwith these systemshave a manifold pressure gauge, which displays MAP within the engine'sintakemanifold.  

Ona standard dayat sea level with the engineshut down, the manifold pressure gauge indicates the ambient absoluteairpressureof  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  .Because atmospheric pressure decreases approximately  $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  per1,000feetof altitude increase, the manifold pressure gauge indicates approximately  $24.92\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  at an airport that is 5,000feet above sea level with standard dayconditions.  

As a normally aspirated aircraft climbs,iteventually reaches an altitude where the MAP is insufficient for a normal climb This altitude limit is known as the aircraft's service ceiling, andit isdirectly affectedby theengine's ability to produce power. If the induction air entering the engine is pressurized, orboosted,byeither asupercharger or aturbosupercharger theaircraft's service ceiling can be increased.Withthese systems, an aircraft can fly at higher altitudes with the advantage of higher true airspeed s and the increased ability to circumnavigate adverse weather.  

# Superchargers  

A supercharger is anengine-driven airpump or compressor that provides compressed air to the engine to provide additional pressure totheinduction airso that theenginecan produce additionalpower.It increases manifold pressure and forces the fuel-air mixture into the cylinders. Higher manifold pressure increases the density of the fuel-airmixtureand increases the power an engine can produce. With a normally aspirated engine,it is not possible to have manifold pressure higher than the existing atmospheric pressure. A supercharger is capable of boosting manifold pressure above  $30~"\mathrm{Hg}$  

For example, at 8,0o0 feet, a typical engine may be able to produce 75 percent of thepower it could produce at mean sealevel(MSL)because the air isless dense at thehigher altitude. The supercharger compresses the air to a higher density allowing a supercharged engine toproduce the same manifold pressure at higher altitudes as it could produce at sea level. Thus, an engine at 8,Ooo feet MSL could still produce  $25\ \mathrm{"Hg}$  of manifold pressure whereas, without a supercharger, it could only produce  $22\ \mathrm{"Hg}$  .Superchargers are especially valuable at high altitudes(suchas18,000feet) wherethe air density is 50 percent that ofsealevel.Theuse of a supercharger in many cases will supply air to the engine at the same density it did at sea level.  

The components in a supercharged induction system are similar to those in a normally aspirated system, with the addition of a supercharger between the fuel metering device and in take manifold. A supercharger is driven by the engine through a gear train at one speed, two speeds, or variable speeds. In addition,superchargers can have one or more stages.Each stage alsoprovides anincreasein pressure and superchargers may be classified as single stage, two stage, or multistage, depending on the number of times compression occurs.  

An early versionof a single-stage,single-speed supercharger maybe referred to as a sea-level supercharger.Anengine equipped with this type of supercharger is called a sea-level engine. With this type of supercharger, a single gear-driven impeller is used toincrease the power produced by an engine at all altitudes.The drawback with this type of superchargeris a decreasein engine power output with an increasein altitude.  

Single-stage, single-speed superchargers are found on many high-powered radial engines and use an air intake that faces forward so the induction system can take full advantage of theram air.In take air passes through ducts to a carburetor, where fuel is metered in proportion to the air flow.The fuel-air charge is then duct ed to the supercharger,orblower impeller, which accelerates the fuel-air mixture outward. Once accelerated,the fuel-air mixture passes through a diffuser, where air velocity is traded for pressure energy. After compression, the resulting high pressure fuel-air mixture is directed to the cylinders.  

Some of the large radial engines developed during World War II have a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. With this type of supercharger, a single impeller may be operated at two speeds. The low impeller speed is often referred to as the low blower setting,while the high impeller speed is called the high blower setting. On engines equipped with a two-speed supercharger,alever orswitchin theflightdeck activates an oil-operated clutch that switchesfrom one speed totheother.  

Under normal operations,takeoff is made with the supercharger in the low blower position. In this mode, the engine performs as a ground-boosted engine, and the power output decreases as the aircraft gains altitude.However,once the aircraft reaches a specified altitude, a power reduction is made, and the supercharger control is switched to the high blower position. The throttle is then reset to the desired manifold pressure. An engine equipped with this type of supercharger is called an altitude engine. [Figure 7-14]  

# Turbosupercharger s  

The most efficientmethod of increasing horsepower in an engine is by using a turbosupercharger or turbocharger.  

![](images/0a611f4c583a12887183298ffd5c0292fecdd02bb02fa39200fb36038243496f.jpg)  
Figure7-14.Power output of normally aspirated engine compared toasingle-stage,two-speed supercharged engine  

Installed on an engine, this booster uses the engine's exhaust gases to drive an air compressor to increase the pressure of the air going into the engine through the carburetor or fuel injection system to boost power at higher altitude.  

Themajor disadvantage of thegear-driven superchargeruse of a large amount of the engine's power output for the amount of power increase produced—-is avoidedwith a turbocharger because turbochargers arepowered by an engine's exhaust gases. This means a turbocharger recovers energy from hot exhaust gases that would otherwise be lost.  

A second advantage of turbochargers over superchargers is the ability tomaintain control over anengine's rated sea- level horsepower from sea level up to the engine'scritical altitude.Critical altitude is the maximum altitude at which a turbocharged engine can produce its rated horsepower Above the critical altitude,power output begins to decrease like it doesfor a normally aspirated engine  

Turbochargers increase the pressure of the engine's induction air,which allows the engine to develop sea level or greater horsepower at higher altitudes. A turbocharger is comprised of two main elements: a compressor and turbine. The compressor section houses an impeller that turns at a high rate ofspeed.As induction air is drawn across the impeller blades. the impeller accelerates the air,allowing a large volume off air to be drawn into the compressor housing. The impeller's action subsequently produces high-pressure, high-density air that is delivered to the engine. To turn the impeller, the engine's exhaust gases are used to drive a turbine wheel that is mounted on the opposite end of the impeller's drive shaft.By directing different amounts of exhaust gases toflow over the turbine, more energy can be extracted, causing the impeller to deliver more compressed air to the engine. The wastegate,essentially an adjustable butterfly valve installed in the exhaust system,is used to vary the mass of exhaust gas flowing into the turbine.Whenclosed,mostof theexhaust gases from the engine areforced toflow through the turbine. When open, the exhaust gases are allowed to bypass the turbine by flowing directly out through the engine's exhaust pipe.[Figure7-15]  

Since the temperature of a gas riseswhen it is compressed, turbocharging causes the temperature of the induction air to increase.To reduce this temperature and lower the risk of detonation, many turbocharged engines use an intercooler. Thissmallheatexchangerusesoutsideairtocoolthehot compressed air before it enters the fuel metering device.  

![](images/5b8d168c1aae78cc3cf2401f9fd1b77ac053844913f4ad9d341b6ed6805eed4a.jpg)  
Figure7-15.Turbocharger components  

# SystemOperation  

On most modern turbocharged engines, the position of the waste gate is governed by a pressure-sensing control mechanism coupled to an actuator.Engine oil directed into or away from this actuator moves the waste gate position. On these systems, the actuator is automatically positioned to produce the desired MAP simply by changing the position of the throttle control  

Other turbocharging system designs use a separate manual control to position the wastegate.With manual control, the manifold pressure gauge must be closely monitored to determine when the desired MAP has been achieved.Manual systems are often found on aircraft that have been modified with aftermarket turbocharging systems. These systems require special operating considerations. For example, if the waste gate is left closed after descending from a high altitude. it is possible to produce a manifold pressure that exceeds the engine'slimitations.Thiscondition,called an over boost, may produce severe detonation because of the leaning effect resulting from increased air density during descent  

Although anautomaticwastegatesystemislesslikelyto experience an overboost condition,it can still occur. If takeoff poweris applied while the engine oil temperature is below its normal operating range, the cold oil may not flow out of the wastegate actuator quickly enough to prevent an overboost. Tohelpprevent overboosting,advance the throttle cautiously to prevent exceeding the maximum manifold pressure limits.  

A pilotflyingan aircraftwith a turbocharger should be aware of system limitations.For example,a turbocharger turbine and impeller can operate atrotational speedsin excess of  $80{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$  while at extremely high temperatures.To achieve high rotational speed, thebearings within the system must be constantly supplied with engine oil to reduce the frictional forces and high temperature. To obtain adequate lubrication, the oil temperature should be in the normal operating range before high throttle settings are applied. In addition, allow the turbocharger tocool and the turbineto slow down before shutting the engine down. Otherwise, the oil remaining in the bearing housing will boil, causing hard carbon deposits to form on the bearings and shaft. These deposits rapidly deteriorate the turbocharger's efficiency and servicelife. For furtherlimitations,refertotheAFM/POH.  

# High Altitude Performance  

As an aircraft equipped with a turbocharging system climbs, the waste gate is gradually closed to maintain the maximum allowable manifold pressure.Atsomepoint,thewastegate is fully closed and further increases in altitude cause the manifold pressure to decrease. This is the critical altitude, which is established by the aircraft or engine manufacturer. When evaluating the performance of the turbocharging system,be aware that if the manifold pressure begins decreasing before the specified critical altitude, the engine and turbocharging system should be inspected by a qualified aviation maintenance technician(AMT)toverifythatthe system is operating properly.  

# Ignition System  

In a spark ignition engine, the ignition system provides a spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders and is made up of magnetos, spark plugs, high-tension leads, and an ignition switch.[Figure7-16]  

A magnetouses a permanent magnet togenerate an electrical current completely independent of the aircraft'selectrical system.The magneto generates sufficiently high voltage to jump a spark across the spark plug gap in each cylinder. The system begins to fire when the starteris engaged and the crankshaft begins to turn.It continues to operate whenever the crankshaft is rotating.  

Most standard certificated aircraft incorporate a dual ignition system with two individual magnetos,separate sets of wires, and spark plugs to increase reliability of the ignition system. Each magneto operates independently to fire one of the two spark plugs in each cylinder. The firing of two spark plugs improves combustion of the fuel-air mixture and results in a slightly higher power output. If one of the magnetos fails, the other is unaffected. The engine continues to operate normally although aslight decreasein enginepower canbeexpected. The same is true if one of the two spark plugs in a cylinder fails  

The operation of the magneto is controlled in the flight deck by the ignition switch. The switch has five positions:  

1. OFF 2. R (right) 3. L (left) 4. BOTH 5. START  

With RIGHT or LEFT selected, only the associated magnetc is activated.The system operates on both magnetos when BOTHisselected.  

A malfunctioning ignition system can be identified during the pretakeoff check by observing the decrease in rpm that occurs when the ignition switch is first moved from BOTH to RIGHT and then from BOTH to LEFT.A small decrease in engine rpm is normal during this check. The permissible decrease is listed in the AFM or POH. If the engine stops running when switched to one magneto or if the rpm drop exceeds the allowable limit,do not fly the aircraft until the problem is corrected. The cause could be fouled plugs,  

![](images/4019303bc0ceba0813117ea1b913ec230a277b0433daecd265451d02bf1ca64e.jpg)  
Figure7-16.Ignition system components.  

broken or shorted wires between the magneto and the plugs, or improperly timedfiringof theplugs.It should benoted that "no drop" in rpm is not normal, and in that instance, the aircraft should not be flown.  

Following engine shutdown,turn the ignition switch to the OFFposition.Even with the battery and master switches OFF,the engine can fire and turnover if the ignition switch is leftON and thepropeller ismovedbecause themagneto requires no outside source of electrical power.Beawareof thepotential for serious injury in this situation.  

Even with the ignition switch in the OFF position,if the ground wire between the magneto and the ignition switch becomes disconnected or broken,theenginecould accidentally start if the propeller is moved with residual fuel in the cylinder. If this occurs, the only way to stop the engine is to move the mixture lever to the idle cutoff position,then have the system checked by a qualified AMT  

# Oil Systems  

The engine oil system performs several important functions:  

Lubrication of the engine's moving parts Cooling of the engine by reducing friction Removing heat from the cylinders Providing a seal between the cylinder walls and pistons Carrying away contaminants  

Reciprocating engines use either a wet-sump or a dry-sump oil system. In a wet-sump system, the oil is located in a sump that is an integral part of the engine.In a dry-sump system, the oil is contained in a separate tank and circulated through the engine bypumps.[Figure7-17]  

The main component of a wet-sump system is the oil pump which draw soil from the sump and routes it to the engine.After the oil passes through the engine, it returns to the sump. In someengines,additional lubrication is supplied by the rotating crankshaft,whichsplashes oil ontoportions of the engine.  

An oil pump also supplies oil pressure in a dry-sump system,but the source of the oil is located external to the engine in a separate oil tank.After oil is routed through the engine, it is pumped from the various locations in the engine back to the oil tank by scavenge pumps. Dry-sump systems allow for a greater volume of oil to be supplied to theengine,which makes them more suitable for very large reciprocating engines.  

The oil pressure gauge provides a direct indication of the oil system operation. It ensures the pressure in pounds per square inch(psi)of theoilsupplied totheengine.Greenindicates the normal operating range, while red indicates the minimum and maximum pressures.There should be an indication of oil pressure during engine start.Refer to the AFM/POH for manufacturer limitations.  

![](images/0486867c3de7880380eba0ff0807b08b642d8cf2c245dfb09c9d712ce42b971b.jpg)  
Figure7-17.Wet-sump oil system  

The oil temperature gauge measures the temperature of oil. A green area shows the normal operating range, and the red line indicates the maximum allowable temperature. Unlike oil pressure, changes in oil temperature occur more slowly. This is particularly noticeable after starting a cold engine, when it may takeseveral minutes or longer for thegauge to showanyincreaseinoiltemperature.  

Check oil temperature periodically during flight especially whenoperatinginhighorlowambientairtemperature. High oil temperature indications may signal a plugged oil line, a low oil quantity, a blocked oil cooler, or a defective temperature gauge.Low oil temperature indications may signal improper oil viscosity duringcold weather operations.  

Theoil filler cap and dipstick(for measuring the oil quantity) are usually accessible through a panel in the engine cowling. If the quantity does not meet the manufacturer'srecommended operatinglevels,oil should be added.TheAFM/POHor placards near the access panel provide information about the correct oil type and weight, as well as the minimum and maximum oil quantity.[Figure7-l8]  

# Engine Cooling Systems  

The burning fuel within the cylinders produces intense heat,most of which is expelled through the exhaust system. Muchof the remaining heat,however,mustberemoved,or at least dissipated, to prevent the engine from overheating Otherwise, the extremely high engine temperatures can lead tolossofpower,excessive oil consumption,detonation,and serious engine damage.  

Whiletheoilsystemisvitaltotheinternalcoolingofthe engine, an additional method of cooling is necessary for the engine's external surface.Most small aircraft are air cooled although some are liquid cooled.  

![](images/f0257f99ad5138d1d2d261be92ba7cb9f9dcc58b3598da8fb866283829bccac7.jpg)  
Figure7-18.Always check the engine oil level during the pref lig hi inspection.  

Air cooling is accomplished by air flowing into the engine compartment through openings in front of the engine cowling.Bafflesroute this airoverfins attached to the engine cylinders, and other parts of the engine, where the air absorbs the engine heat. Expulsion of the hot air takes place through one or more openings in the lower, aft portion of the engine cowling.[Figure7-19]  

The outside air enters the engine compartment through an inletbehind thepropeller hub.Baffles directit tothehottest parts of the engine,primarily the cylinders,which havefins that increase the area exposed to the airflow.  

The air cooling system is less effective during ground operations, takeoffs, go-arounds,and other periods of high power, low-airspeed operation.Conversely,high-speed descents provide excess air andcanshockcool theengine, subjecting it to abrupt temperature fluctuations.  

Operating the engine at higher than its designed temperature can cause loss of power, excessive oil consumption,and detonation. It will also lead to serious permanent damage, such as scoring the cylinder walls, damaging the pistons and rings, and burning and warping the valves. Monitoring the flight deck engine temperature instruments aids in avoiding high operating temperature.  

Under normal operating conditionsin aircraft not equipped withcowlflaps,theengine temperature canbe controlled  

![](images/a86241052df0433d42d0f4ceb236a405e2b35241c5ac09a9b0c8a24aba46d36c.jpg)  
Figure7-19.Outside air aids in cooling theengine  

by changing the airspeed or the power output of the engine High engine temperatures can be decreased by increasing the airspeed and/or reducing the power.  

The oil temperature gauge gives an indirect and delayed indication of rising engine temperature,but canbeused for determining engine temperature if this is the only meansavailable.  

Most aircraft areequippedwith a cylinder-head temperature gauge thatindicates a direct and immediate cylinder temperature change. This instrument is calibrated in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit and is usually color coded with agreen arctoindicatethenormaloperatingrange.Aredlineon the instrument indicates maximum allowable cylinder head temperature.  

To avoid excessive cylinder head temperatures,increase airspeed,enrich the fuel-air mixture,and/or reduce power.Any of these procedures help to reduce the engine temperature.Onaircraftequippedwithcowlflaps,usethe cowl flap positions to control the temperature. Cowl flaps are hinged covers that fit over the opening through which the hot air is expelled. If the engine temperature is low, the cowl flaps canbeclosed,there by restricting theflow of expelled hot air and increasing engine temperature. If the engine temperature ishigh,the cowl flaps canbe opened topermit a greater flow of air through the system, thereby decreasing the engine temperature.  

# Exhaust Systems  

Engine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion gases overboard,provide heat for the cabin,anddefrostthe windscreen. An exhaust system has exhaust piping attached tothecylinders,as well as a muffler and a muffler shroud. The exhaustgases arepushed out of thecylinder through the exhaust valve and then through the exhaust pipe system totheatmosphere.  

For cabinheat,outside air is drawn intotheair inlet and is ducted through a shroud around the muffler. The muffler is heated by the exiting exhaust gases and, in turn, heats the air around themuffler.Thisheated airisthenducted tothe cabin for heat and defrost applications. The heat and defrost are controlled in the flight deck and can be adjusted to the desiredlevel.  

Exhaust gases contain large amounts of carbon monoxide which is odorless and colorless. Carbon monoxide is deadly, and its presence is virtually impossible to detect. To ensure that exhaust gases are properly expelled, the exhaust system must be in good condition and free of cracks.  

Some exhaust systems have an EGT probe.This probe transmitstheEGT to an instrument in the flight deck.The EGT gauge measures the temperature of the gases at the exhaust manifold. This temperature varies with the ratio of fuel to air entering the cylinders and can be used as a basis for regulating thefuel-air mixture.TheEGT gauge ishighly accurate in indicating the correct fuel-air mixture setting. When using the EGT to aid in leaning the fuel-air mixture, fuel consumption can be reduced. For specific procedures, refer to the manufacturer's recommendations for leaning the fuel-airmixture.  

# Starting System  

Most small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter system. This system consists of a source ofelectricity, wiring, switches,andsolenoidstooperatethestarterandastarter motor. Most aircraft have starters that automatically engage and disengage when operated, but some older aircraft have starters that are mechanically engaged by a lever actuated by the pilot. The starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating the engine at a speed that allows the engine to start and maintain operation.  

Electrical power forstarting is usually supplied by an onboard battery,but can alsobesupplied byexternalpower through anexternal power receptacle.When the battery switch is turned on,electricity is supplied to the main power bus bar through the battery solenoid.Both the starter and the starter switch draw current from the main bus bar, but the starter will not operateuntil the starting solenoid isenergized by thestarter switch being turned to the“start"position.When thestarter switch is released from the“start"position,the solenoid removes power from the starter motor.Thestarter motor is protected from being driven by the engine through a clutch in the starter drive that allows the engine to run faster than thestarter motor.[Figure7-20]  

When starting an engine,the rules of safety and courtesy should be strictly observed.One of the most important safety rules is to ensure there is noone near the propeller prior to starting the engine.In addition, the wheels should be chocked and the brakes set to avoid hazards caused by unintentional movement. To avoid damage to the propeller and property, the aircraft should beinan area where the propeller will not stirupgravel ordust.  

# Combustion  

During normal combustion, the fuel-air mixture burns in a very controlled and predictable manner. In a spark ignition engine, the process occurs in a fraction of a second. The mixture actually begins to burn at the point where it is ignited  

![](images/315e162ce375f55f279748594313713dc255b2af7af37bbe568e4a843dc3f813.jpg)  
Figure7-20.Typical starting circuit.  

by the spark plugs. It then burns away from the plugs until it is completely consumed.This type of combustion causes a smooth build-up of temperature and pressure and ensures that the expanding gases deliver the maximum force to the piston at exactly the right time in the power stroke.[Figure 7-21] Detonation is an uncontrolled,explosive ignition of the fuel-air mixture within the cylinder's combustion chamber. It causes excessive temperatures and pressures which,ifnot corrected,can quickly lead to failure of thepiston,cylinder or valves. In less severe cases, detonation causes engine overheating, roughness,or loss of power.  

Detonationis characterized byhigh cylinder head temperatures and is most likelyto occur when operating at high power settings.Common operational causes of detonation are:  

Use of a lower fuel grade than that specified by the aircraft manufacturer Operation of the engine with extremely high manifold pressures in conjunction with low rpm Operation of the engine at high power settings with an excessively lean mixture  

![](images/b5e6aad9cdd97ad261e3606b9598c551c763baa13e892bbba177087a12322786.jpg)  
Figure7-21.Normal combustion and explosive combustion  

Maintaining extended ground operations or steep climbsin which cylinder cooling is reduced  

Detonation maybe avoided by following these ba sio guidelines during the various phases of ground and flight operations:  

Ensure that the proper grade of fuel is used. Keep thecowlflaps(if available)in the full-openpositionwhile on theground to provide the maximum air flow through the cowling. Use an enriched fuel mixture,as well as a shallow climb angle,to increase cylinder cooling during takeoff and initial climb. Avoid extended, high power, steep climbs Develop thehabit of monitoring the engine instruments to verify proper operation according to procedures established by the manufacturer.  

Preignition occurs when the fuel-air mixture ignites prior totheengine'snormal ignitionevent.Premature burning is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the combustion chamber, often created by a small carbon deposit on a spark plug, a cracked spark plug insulator, or other damage in the cylinder that causes a part toheat sufficiently to ignite the fuel-air charge. Preignition causes the engine to lose power and produces high operating temperature. As with detonation, pre ignition may also cause severe engine damage because the expanding gases exert excessive pressure on the piston while still on its compression stroke  

Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneously and one may cause the other. Since either condition causes high engine temperature accompanied by a decrease in engine performance, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two.Using the recommended grade of fuel and operating the engine within its proper temperature, pressure, and rpm ranges reduce the chance of detonation or preignition.  

# Full AuthorityDigitalEngineControl (FADEC)  

FADEC is a system consisting of a digital computer and ancillary components that control an aircraft's engine andpropeller.First used in turbine-poweredaircraft,and referred to as full authority digital electronic control,these sophisticated control systems are increasingly being used in piston powered aircraft.  

In a spark-ignition reciprocating engine, the FADEC uses speed, temperature, and pressure sensors to monitor the status of each cylinder.A digital computer calculates theideal pulse for each injector and adjusts ignition timing as necessary to achieve optimal performance.In a compression-ignition engine, the FADEC operates similarly and performs all of the same functions, excluding those specifically related to the spark ignition process.  

FADE C systems eliminate the need for magnetos,carburetor heat, mixture controls, and engine priming. A single throttle leverischaracteristicofanaircraftequippedwithaFADEC system.The pilot simply positions the throttle lever to a desireddetent,suchasstart,idle,cruisepower,ormaxpower, and the FADEC system adjusts the engine and propeller automatically for the modes elected.There is no need for the pilot tomonitor or control thefuel-air mixture.  

Duringaircraftstarting,theFADECprimesthecylinders. adjusts the mixture,and positions the throttle based on engine temperature and ambient pressure.During cruise flight, the FADEC constantly monitors the engine and adjustsfuel flow andignition timing individually in each cylinder.Thisprecise control of the combustion process often results in decreased fuel consumption and increased horsepower.  

FADEC systems are considered an essential partof the engine and propeller control and may be powered by the aircraft's main electrical system. In many aircraft, FADEC uses power from a separate generator connected to the engine. In either case, there must be a backup electrical source available because failure of aFA DEC system could result in a complete loss of engine thrust. To prevent loss of thrust, two separate and identical digital channels areincorporated for redundancy.Each channelis capable of providing all engine and propeller functions without limitations.  

# Turbine Engines  

An aircraft turbine engine consists of an air inlet, compressor, combustion chambers, a turbine section, and exhaust. Thrust is produced by increasing the velocity of the air flowing through the engine.Turbineengines are highly desirable aircraft powerplants.They are characterized by smooth operation and a high power-to-weight ratio, and they use readily available jet fuel.Prior to recent advances in material, engine design, and manufacturing processes, the use of turbine engines in small/light production aircraft was cost prohibitive. Today, several aviation manufacturers are producing or plan to produce small/lightturbine-powered aircraft. These smaller turbine-powered aircraft typically seat between three and seven passengers and are referred to as very light jets (VLJs) or microjets.[Figure 7-22]  

# Types of Turbine Engines  

Turbine engines are classified according to the type of compressors they use.There are three types of compressors centrifugalflow,axialflow,andcentrifugal-axialflow. Compression of inlet air is achieved in a centrifugal flow engine by accelerating air outward perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the machine. The axial-flow engine compresses air by a series of rotating and stationary airfoils moving the air parallel to the longitudinal axis. The centrifugal-axial flow design uses both kinds of compressors to achieve the desired compression.  

The path the air takes through the engine and how power is produced determines thetypeofengine.There arefour types of aircraft turbine engines—turbojet, turboprop, turbofan, andturboshaft.  

# Turbojet  

The turbojet engine consists of four sections—compressor, combustion chamber, turbine section, and exhaust. The compressor section passes inlet air at a high rate of speed to

the combustion chamber.The combustion chamber contains the fuel inlet and igniter for combustion.Theexpanding air drives a turbine,which is connected by a shaft to the compressor, sustaining engine operation. The accelerated exhaust gases from the engineprovide thrust. Thisis a basic application of compressing air, igniting the fuel-air mixture, producing power toself-sustainthe engine operation,and exhaustforpropulsion.[Figure7-23]  

Turbojet engines are limited in range and endurance. They are also slow to respond to throttle applications atslow compressor speeds.  

# Turboprop  

A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives a propeller through a reductiongear.The exhaust gases drive a power turbine connected by a shaft that drives the reduction gear assembly. Reduction gearing is necessary in turboprop engines because optimum propeller performanceis achieved at much slower speeds than the engine's operating rpm Turboprop engines are a compromise between turbojet engines and reciprocating powerplants. Turboprop engines are most efficient at speedsbetween 250 and  $400\;\mathrm{mph}$  and altitudes between 18,000 and 30,000 feet. They also perform well attheslow airspeed s required for takeoff andlanding and are fuel efficient. The minimum specific fuel consumption of the turboprop engine is normally available in the altitude range of 25,000feet to thetropopause.[Figure7-24]  

# Turbofan  

Turbofan s were developed tocombinesome of thebest features of the turbojet and the turboprop. Turbofan engines are designed to create additional thrust by diverting a secondary air flow around the combustion chamber.The turbofan bypass air generates increased thrust, cools the engine,and aidsin exhaust noise suppression.Thisprovides turbojet-type cruise speed and lower fuel consumption  

The inlet air that passes through a turbofan engine is usually divided into two separate streams of air. One stream passes through the engine core, while a second stream bypasses the engine core. It is this bypass stream of air that is responsible for the term "bypass engine." A turbofan's bypass ratio refers to the ratio of the mass air flow that passes through the far divided by the mass airflow that passes through the engine core.[Figure7-25]  

# Turboshaft  

The fourth common type of jet engine is the turboshaft. [Figure 7-26] It delivers power to a shaft that drives something other than a propeller. The biggest difference between a turbojet and turboshaft engine is that on a

Figure7-26.Turbo shaft engine  

turboshaft engine, most of the energy produced by the expanding gases is used to drive a turbine rather than produce thrust. Many helicopters use a turboshaft gas turbine engine. Inaddition,turbo shaft engines are widely used as auxiliary power units on large aircraft.  

# Turbine Engine Instruments  

Engine instruments that indicate oil pressure, oil temperature, enginespeed,exhaust gas temperature,andfuelfloware common to both turbine and reciprocating engines. However, there are some instruments that are unique to turbine engines. These instruments provide indications of engine pressure ratio,turbine discharge pressure, and torque.In addition, most gas turbine engines have multiple temperature-sensing instruments,called thermocouples,which provide pilots with temperature readings in and around the turbine section.  

# Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)  

An engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge is used to indicate the power output of a turbojet/turbofan engine.EPR is theratio of turbine discharge to compressor inlet pressure.Pressure measurements are recorded by probes installed in the engine inletand attheexhaust.Oncecollected,thedataissent to a differential pressure transducer, which is indicated on a flight deck EPR gauge.  

EPR system design automatically compensates for the effects of airspeed and altitude.Changes in ambient temperature require a correction be applied to EPR indications to provide accurate engine power settings.  

# Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)  

A limiting factor in a gas turbine engine is the temperature of the turbine section.The temperature of a turbine section mustbemonitored closely to prevent overheating the turbine blades and other exhaust section components. One common way of monitoring the temperature of a turbine section is with an EGT gauge. EGT is an engine operating limit used to monitor overall engine operating conditions.  

Variations of EG T systems bear different names based on the location of the temperature sensors.Commonturbine temperature sensing gauges include the turbine inlet temperature (TIT) gauge, turbine outlet temperature (TOT) gauge, interstage turbine temperature (ITT) gauge, and turbine gas temperature(TGT)gauge  

# Torquemeter  

Turboprop/turboshaft engine power output is measured by the torquemeter. Torque is a twisting force applied to a shaft. The torquemeter measures power applied to the shaft.  

Turboprop and turboshaft engines are designed to produce torque for driving a propeller. Torquemeters are calibrated in percentage units, foot-pounds, or psi.  

#  $N_{I}$  Indicator  

$\mathbf{N}_{1}$  represents the rotational speed of the low pressure compressor and is presented on the indicator as a percentage of design rpm.After start, the speed of the low pressure compressor is governed by the  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$  turbinewheel.The  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$  turbine wheel is connected to the low pressure compressor through a concentric shaft.  

#  $N_{2}$  Indicator  

$\mathbf{N}_{2}$  represents the rotational speed of the high pressure compressor and is presented on the indicator as a percentage of design rpm. The high pressure compressor is governed by the  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$  turbinewheel.The  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$  turbinewheelis connected to the high pressure compressor through a concentric shaft.[Figure7-27]  

# Turbine Engine Operational Considerations  

The great variety of turbine engines makes it impractical to cover specific operational procedures,but there arecertain operational considerations common to all turbineengines. They are engine temperature limits, foreign object damage, hot start,compressor stall,and flameout.  

# Engine Temperature Limitations  

The highest temperature in any turbine engine occurs at the turbine inlet.TIT is therefore usually the limiting factor in turbine engine operation.  

# Thrust Variations  

Turbine engine thrust varies directly with air density. As air density decreases,sodoes thrust.Additionally,because air density decreases with an increase in temperature, increased  

![](images/10fbfd1ab4b01fda5ed64535aed67eacd4672f19ac116984afca9166dc742f79.jpg)  
Figure7-27.Dual-spoolaxial-flowcompressor.  

temperatures also results in decreased thrust.While both turbine and reciprocating powered engines are affected to some degree by high relative humidity, turbine engines will experience a negligible loss of thrust, while reciprocating engines a significant loss of brake horsepower.  

# Foreign Object Damage (FOD)  

Duetothedesign andfunctionof a turbineengine's airinlet, the possibility of ingestion of debris always exists.This causes significant damage, particularly to the compressor and turbine sections. When ingestion of debris occurs, it is calledforeign object damage (FOD).Typical FODconsists of small nicks and dents caused by ingestion of small objects from the ramp, taxiway, or runway, but FOD damage caused by bird strikes or ice ingestion also occur.SometimesFOD resultsintotal destruction of anengine  

Prevention of FOD is a high priority. Some engine inlets have a tendency to form a vortex between the ground and the inlet during ground operations. A vortex dissipater may beinstalledon theseengines.Other devices,such asscreens and/ordeflectors,may also be utilized.Pre flight procedures includeavisualinspectionfor anysignofFOD  

# Turbine Engine Hot/Hung Start  

WhentheEGTexceedsthesafelimitofanaircraft,it experiences a“hot start. This is caused by too much fuel entering the combustion chamber or insufficient turbine rpm. Any time anengine has a hot start, refer to the AFM/POHor an appropriate maintenance manual for inspection requirements.  

If the engine fails to accelerate to the proper speed after ignition or does not accelerate toidle rpm, a hung or false start has occurred. A hung start may be caused by an insufficient startingpower source or fuel control malfunction.  

# Compressor Stalls  

Compressor blades are small airfoils and are subject to the same aerodynamic principles that apply to any airfoil. A compressor blade has a nAO A that is a result of inlet air velocity and the compressor's rotational velocity.Thesetwo forces combine to form a vector,which defines the airfoil's actual AO A to the approaching inlet air.  

A compressors tallis an imbalance between the two vector quantities, inlet velocity, and compressor rotational speed. Compressor stalls occur when the compressor blades'AOA exceeds the critical AOA.At this point,smooth airflow is interrupted and turbulence is created with pressure fluctuations.Compressor stalls cause air flowing in the compressor toslow down and stagnate,sometimes reversing direction.[Figure7-28]  

![](images/48a7b2eec185c39136d6a43e23d17958fcea3a18746ce958f2b69c9abfeca756.jpg)  
Figure7-28.Comparison of normal and distorted air flow into the compressor section  

Compressorstallscanbetransientandintermittentorsteady andsevere.Indications of a transient/intermittent stall are usually anintermittent"bang”asbackfire and flowreversal take place. If the stall develops and becomes steady, strong vibration and aloud roar may develop from the continuous flow reversal. Often, the flight deck gauges do not show a mild or transient stall, but they do indicate a developed stall. Typical instrument indications include fluctuations in rpm and an increase in exhaust gas temperature. Most transient stalls are not harmful to the engine and often correct themselves after one or two pulsations. The possibility of severe engine damage from a steady states tallis immediate. Recovery must be accomplished by quickly reducing power, decreasing the aircraft's AOA, and increasing airspeed.  

Although all gas turbine engines are subject to compressor stalls,most models have systems that inhibit them.One systemuses avariableinletguidevane(VIGV)andvariable stator vanes that direct the incoming air into the rotor blades at an appropriate angle.To prevent air pressure stalls. operate the aircraftwithin the parameters established by the manufacturer.If a compressors tall does develop,followthe procedures recommended in the AFM/POH.  

# Flameout  

A flameout occurs in the operation of a gas turbine engine in which the fire in the engine unintentionally goes out. If the rich limit of the fuel-air ratio is exceeded in the combustion chamber,the flame will blowout.This condition is often referred to as a rich flame out.It generally results from very fast engine acceleration where an overly rich mixture causes thefuel temperature to dropbelowthe combustion temperature.It may also because d by insufficient air flow to support combustion.  

A more common flame out occurrence is due to low fuel pressure and low engine speeds,whichtypically are associated with high-altitudeflight.This situation may also occur with the engine throttled back during a descent, which cansetupthelean-condition flame out.Aweakmixturecan easily cause the flame to die out,even with a normal air flow through the engine.  

Any interruption of the fuel supply can result in a flameout. This may be due to prolonged unusual attitudes. a malfunctioning fuel control system, turbulence, icing, or running out of fuel.  

Symptoms of aflame out normally are the same as those following an enginefailure.If theflameout is due to a transitory condition,such as an imbalance between fuel flow and engine speed, an airstart may be attempted once the condition is corrected. In any case, pilots must follow the applicable emergency procedures outlined in the AFM/ POH.Generally these procedures contain recommendations concerningaltitudeandairspeedwheretheairstartismost likely to be successful.  

# Performance Comparison  

It is possible to compare theperformance of a reciprocating powerplant and different types of turbine engines. For the comparison to be accurate,thrust horsepower(usable horsepower)for the reciprocating powerplant must be used rather thanbrake horsepower,and net thrust mustbeused for the turbine-powered engines.In addition, aircraft design configuration and size must be approximately the same.  

When comparing performance, the following definitions areuseful:  

Brakehorsepower (BHP)—thehorsepower actually delivered to the output shaft. Brake horsepower is the actual usable horsepower. Net thrust—the thrust produced by a turbojet or turbofanengine. Thrust horsepower(THP)—the horsepower equivalent of the thrust produced by a turbojet or turbofan engine  

Equivalent shaft horsepower (ESHP)—with respect to turboprop engines,thesum of the shaft horsepower (SHP)delivered to thepropeller and THP produced by the exhaustgases.  

Figure 7-29 shows howfour types of enginescompare in net thrust as airspeed is increased. This figure is for explanatory  

![](images/7c442f4b5a7e07782fd344b39595d2020fcf458d551d60ffd6a4ddf38c653a1c.jpg)

purposes only and is not for specific models of engines. The following are the four types of engines:  

Reciprocating powerplant Turbine,propeller combination (turboprop) Turbine engine incorporating a fan (turbofan) Turbojet(purejet)  

By plotting the performance curve for each engine,a comparison can be made of maximum aircraft speed variation with the type of engine used.Since the graph is only a means of comparison, numerical values for net thrust, aircraft speed, and drag are not included.  

Comparison of thefour powerplants on thebasis of net thrust makes certain performance capabilities evident. In the speed range shown to the left of line A, the reciprocating powerplant outperforms the other three types. The turboprop outperforms the turbofan in the range to the left of line C. The turbofan engine outperforms the turbojet in the range to the left of line F. The turbofan engine outperforms the reciprocating powerplant to the right of line B and the turboprop to the right of line C. The turbojet outperforms the reciprocating powerplant to the right of line D, the turboprop to the right of line E, and the turbofan to the right of line F  

Thepointswheretheaircraftdragcurveintersectsthenet thrust curves are the maximum aircraft speeds.Thevertical lines from each of the points to the baseline of the graph indicate that the turbojet aircraft can attain a higher maximum speed than aircraft equipped with the other types of engines. Aircraft equipped with the turbofan engine attains a higher maximum speed than aircraft equipped with a turboprop or reciprocating powerplant.  

# Airframe Systems  

Fuel, electrical, hydraulic, and oxygen systems make up the airframesystems.  

# Fuel Systems  

Thefuel systemis designed toprovide anuninterrupted flow of clean fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine.The fuel must be available to the engine under all conditions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and during all approved flight maneuvers. Two common classifications apply to fuel systems in small aircraft:gravity-feedandfuel-pumpsystems  

# Gravity-Feed System  

Thegravity-feed system utilizes the force of gravity to transfer the fuel from the tanks to the engine. For example, on high-wing airplanes, thefuel tanks areinstalled in the wings. This places thefuel tanks above the carburetor, and the fuel is gravity fed through the system and into the carburetor. If the design of the aircraft is such that gravity cannot be used to transfer fuel,fuel pumps are installed.For example, on low-wing airplanes, the fuel tanks in the wings are located below the carburetor.[Figure7-30]  

# Fuel-Pump System  

Aircraft with fuel-pump systems have twofuel pumps.The main pump system is engine driven with an electrically- driven auxiliary pump provided for use in engine starting and in the event the engine pump fails. The auxiliary pump, also known as a boost pump, provides added reliability to the fuel system. The electrically-driven auxiliary pump is controlled by a switch in the flight deck  

# Fuel Primer  

Both gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems may incorporate a fuel primer into the system. The fuel primer is used to draw fuel from the tanks to vaporize fuel directly into the cylinders prior to starting the engine. During cold weather, when engines are difficult to start, the fuel primer helps because there is not enough heat available to vaporize the fuel in the carburetor. It is important to lock the primer in place when it is not in use. If the knob is free to move, it may vibrate out of position duringflight which may cause an excessively rich fuel-air mixture. To avoid overpriming, read the priming instructions for the aircraft.  

# Fuel Tanks  

The fuel tanks, normally located inside the wings of an airplane, have a filler opening on top of the wing through which they can be filled. A filler cap covers this opening  

![](images/5969a6d49737b226fdb8f23db0521efa58bf962378b4096cf96176ab3594ed90.jpg)  
Figure7-30.Gravity-feedandfuel-pumpsystems.  

The tanks arevented to the outside to maintain atmospheric pressure inside the tank. They may be vented through the filler cap or through a tube extending through the surface of the wing. Fuel tanks also include an overflow drain that may standalone or be collocated with the fuel tank vent. This allows fuel to expand with increases in temperature without damage to the tank itself.If the tanks have been filledonahotday,it is not unusual to see fuel coming from the overflow drain.  

# Fuel Gauges  

The fuel quantity gauges indicate the amount of fuel measured by a sensing unit in eachfuel tank andis displayed ingallons or pounds.Aircraft certification rules require accuracyinfuel gauges only when they read"empty."Any reading other than“empty” should be verified. Do not depend solely on the accuracy of the fuel quantity gauges. Always visually check the fuellevel in each tank during the preflight inspection, and then compare it with the corresponding fuel quantity indication.  

If a fuel pump is installed in the fuel system, a fuel pressure gauge is also included.This gauge indicates the pressure in the fuel lines. The normal operating pressure can be found in the AFM/POH or on the gauge by color coding.  

# Fuel Selectors  

The fuels elector valve allows selection of fuel from various tanks.A common type of selector valve contains four positions: LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH,and OFF. Selecting the LEFT or RIGHT position allows fuel to feed only from the respective tank, while selecting the BOTH position feeds fuel from both tanks. The LEFT or RIGHT position may be used tobalance the amount of fuel remaining in eachwing tank.[Figure7-31]  

Fuel placards show any limitations on fuel tank usage, such as"level flight only”and/or"both"for landings and takeoffs  

Regardless of the type of fuel selector in use,fuel consumption should be monitored closely to ensure that a tank does not run completely out of fuel. Running a fuel tank dry does not only cause the engine to stop, but running for prolonged periods on one tank causes an unbalanced fuelload between tanks. Running a tank completely dry may allow air to enter the fuel system and cause vapor lock, which makes it difficult to restart the engine. On fuel-injected engines, the fuel becomes so hot it vaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing fuel to reach the cylinders.

Figure7-31.Fuels elector valve.  

# Fuel Strainers, Sumps, and Drains  

After leaving the fuel tank and before it enters the carburetor, the fuel passes through as trainer that removes any moisture andothersedimentsinthesystem.Sincethesecontaminants are heavier than aviation fuel,they settle in a sump at the bottom of the strainer assembly. A sump is a low point in a fuel system and/orfuel tank. Thefuel system may contain a sump, a fuel strainer,and fuel tank drains,which maybe collocated.  

The fuels trainer should be drained before each flight.Fuel samples should be drained and checked visually for water andcontaminants.  

Water in the sumpis hazardous because in cold weather the water can freeze and block fuel lines.Inwarmweather,it canflowinto the carburetor andstop the engine.If wateris present in the sump, more water in the fuel tanks is probable, and they should be drained until there is no evidence of water. Never takeoff until all water and contaminants have been removed from the engine fuel system.  

Because of the variation in fuel systems,become thoroughly familiar with the systems that apply to the aircraft being flown. Consult theAFM/POHforspecific operating procedures.  

# Fuel Grades  

Aviation gasoline(AVGAS)is identifiedby an octane or performance number (grade), which designates the antiknock value or knock resistance of the fuel mixture in the engine cylinder.Thehigher thegrade of gasoline,themorepressure thefuel can withstand without detonating. Lower grades of fuel are used in lower-compression engines because these fuels ignite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used in higher-compression engines because they ignite at higher temperatures, but not prematurely. If the proper grade of fuel is not available, use the next higher grade as a substitute. Never use a grade lower than recommended.Thiscancausethe cylinder head temperature andengineoil temperature to exceed their normal operating ranges,which may result in detonation.  

SeveralgradesofAVGASareavailable.Caremustbe exercised to ensure that the correct aviation grade is being used for the specific type of engine. The proper fuel grade is stated in the AFM/POH, on placards in the flight deck, and next to the filler caps.Automobile gas should NEVER be used in aircraft engines unless the aircraft has been modified with a Supplemental Type Certificate(STC)issuedbythe Federal Aviation Administration(FAA).  

The current method identifies A VGAS for aircraft with reciprocating engines by the octane and performance number, along with the abbreviation A VGAS.These aircraft use AVGAS80,100,and100LL.AlthoughAVGAS100LL performsthesameasgrade1oo,the"LL"indicatesithas alowleadcontent.Fuel for aircraft with turbine engines is classified as JET A,JETA-1,andJETB.Jet fuel is basically kerosene and has a distinctive kerosene smell.Sinceuseoff the correct fuel is critical,dyes are added to help identify the type andgradeoffuel.[Figure7-32]  

In addition to the color of the fuel itself, the color-coding system extends to decals andvarious airport fuel handling equipment.For example, all AVGAS is identified by name, using white letters on a redbackground.Incontrast,turbine fuels are identified by white letters on a black background  

Special Air worthiness Information Bulletin g(SAIB) NE-11-15 advises that grade100VLL AVGAS is acceptable for use on aircraft and engines.1ooVLL meets all performance requirements of grades 80, 91, 100, and 100LL; meets the approved operating limitations for aircraft and engines certificated to operate with these other grades of AVGAS; and is basically identical to 100LL AVGAS. The lead content of 100VLL is reduced by about 19 percent. 100VLL is blue like 100LL and virtually indistinguishable.  

# Fuel Contamination  

Accidents attributed to powerplant failure from fuel contamination have often been traced to:  

Inadequate preflight inspection by the pilot Servicing aircraft with improperly filtered fuel from small tanks or drums Storing aircraft with partially filled fuel tanks Lack of proper maintenance  

Fuel should be drained from thefuel strainer quick drain and from each fuel tank sump into a transparent container and thencheckedfor dirt andwater.When thefuelstrainer is being drained, water in the tank may not appear until all the fuel has been drained from the lines leading to the tank. This indicates that water remains in the tank and is not forcing the fuel out of the fuel lines leading to the fuel strainer. Therefore, drain enough fuel from the fuel strainer to be certain that fuel is being drained from the tank. The amount depends on  

![](images/7efde19b2afa9baa33667f3e83e8fc32c4ceca92d28016f3cf28b762bccef360.jpg)  
Figure7-32.Aviation fuel color-codingsystem  

thelengthof fuellinefrom thetank tothedrain.If water or other contaminants are found in the first sample, drain furthen samples until not race appears.  

Water may alsoremain in thefuel tanks after the drainage from the fuels trainer has ceased to show anytraceofwater. This residual water can be removed only by draining the fuel tanksumpdrains.  

Water is the principal fuel contaminant. Suspended water droplets in the fuel can be identified by a cloudy appearance of thefuel,or by the clear separation of water from thecolored fuel,which occurs after the water has settled to the bottom of the tank.As a safety measure, the fuel sumps should be drained before every flight during the preflight inspection.  

Fuel tanks should be filled aftereachflight or after thelast flight of the day to prevent moisture condensation within the tank. To prevent fuel contamination, avoid refueling from cansanddrums.  

In remote areas or in emergency situations,theremaybeno alternative to refueling from sources with inadequate anti- contamination systems.While a chamois skin and funnel may be the only possible means of filtering fuel, using themishazardous.Remember,the use of a chamois does not always ensure decontaminated fuel.Worn-outchamois do not filter water;neitherwillanew,clean chamois that is already water-wet or damp.Most imitation chamois skins do not filter water.  

# Fuel System lcing  

Ice formation in the aircraft fuel system results from the presence of water in the fuel system. This water may be un dissolved or dissolved.One condition of un dissolved water is entrained water that consists of minute water particles suspended in the fuel. This may occur as a result of mechanical agitation of free water or conversion of dissolved water through temperature reduction.Entrained watersettles out in time under static conditions and mayor may not be drained during normal servicing, depending on the rate at which it is converted tofreewater.In general,it is not likely that all entrained water can ever be separated from fuel under field conditions.The settling rate depends on a series of factors including temperature,quiescence, and droplet size.  

The droplet size varies depending upon the mechanics offormation.Usually,the particles are so small as to be invisible to the naked eye, but in extreme cases, can cause slight haziness in thefuel.Water in solution cannot be removed except by dehydration or by converting it through temperature reduction to entrained, then to free water.  

Another condition of un dissolved water is free water that may be introduced as a result of refueling or the settling of entrained water that collects at thebottom of a fuel tank.Free water is usually present in easily detected quantities at the bottom of the tank, separated by a continuous interfacefrom thefuelabove.Free water can be drained from a fuel tank through the sump drains, which are provided for that purpose. Free water,frozen onthebottomof reservoirs,such as the fuel tanks and fuel filter,mayrenderwater drainsuseless andcanlatermeltreleasingthewaterintothesystemthereby causing engine malfunction or stoppage. If such a condition is detected, the aircraft may be placed in a warm hangar to reestablish proper draining of these reservoirs,and allsumps and drains should be activated and checked prior to flight  

Entrained water (i.e., waterin solution with petroleum fuels) constitutes a relativelysmall part of thetotal potential water in a particular system, the quantity dissolved being dependent on fuel temperature and the existing pressure and the water volubility characteristics of thefuel.Entrained waterfreezes in mid fuel and tends to stay in suspension longer since the specific gravity of ice is approximately the same as that of AVGAS.  

Water in suspensionmay freeze and form ice crystals of sufficient size such that fuel screens,strainers,andfilters maybeblocked.Some of this water maybe cooledfurther as thefuel enters carburetor air passages and causes carburetor metering component icing,when conditions are not otherwise conducivetothisform oficing  

# Prevention Procedures  

The use of anti-icing additives for some aircraft has been approved as a means of preventing problems with water and ice in AVGAS.Some laboratory and flight testing indicates that the use of he xy lene glycol,certainmethanol derivatives, and ethylene glycol mononethyl ether (EGME) in small concentrations inhibit fuel system icing. These tests indicate that the use of EGME at a maximum O.15 percent by volume concentration substantially inhibits fuel system icing under most operating conditions.The concentration of additives in the fuel is critical.Marked deterioration in additive effectiveness may result from too little or too much additive.Pilots should recognize that anti-icingadditives are in no way a substitute or replacement for carburetor heat. Aircraft operating instructions involving the use of carburetor heat should be adhered to at all times when operating under atmospheric conditions conducive to icing  

# Refueling Procedures  

Static electricity is formed by the friction of air passing over the surfaces of an aircraft in flight and by the flow of fuel through the hose and nozzle during refueling. Nylon, Dacron, or wool clothing is especially prone to accumulate and discharge static electricity from the person to the funnel or nozzle.Toguard against thepossibility of static electricity igniting fuel fumes, a ground wire should be attached to the aircraft before the fuel cap is removed from thetank.Because both the aircraft and refueler have different static charges, bonding both components to each other is critical. By bonding both components to each other,the static differential charge is equalized. The refueling nozzle should be bonded to the aircraft before refueling begins and should remain bonded throughout the refueling process. When a fuel truck is used, it should be grounded prior to the fuel nozzle contacting the aircraft.  

If fueling from drums or cans is necessary, proper bonding and grounding connections areimportant. Drums should be placed near grounding posts, and the following sequence of connections observed:  

1. Drum to ground 2. Ground to aircraft 3. Drum to aircraft or nozzle to aircraft before removing the fuel cap  

When disconnecting, reverse the order.  

The passage of fuel through a chamois increases the charge of static electricity and the danger of sparks.Theaircraft must be properly grounded and the nozzle, chamois filter, andfunnel bonded to the aircraft.If a can is used,it should be connected to either the grounding post or the funnel. Under no circumstances should a plastic bucket or similar nonconductive container be used in this operation.  

# Heating System  

There are many different types of aircraft heating systems that are available depending on the type of aircraft.Regardless of which type or the safety features that accompany them,itis always important toreference the specific aircraft operator's manual and become knowledgeable about the heatingsystem. Each has different repair and inspection criteria that should be precisely followed.  

# Fuel Fired Heaters  

A fuel fired heater is a small mounted or portable space- heating device. The fuel is brought to the heater by using pipingfrom afuel tank,ortapsinto the aircraft'sfuel system. A fan blows air into a combustion chamber, and a spark plug or ignition device lights the fuel-air mixture. A built-in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working Outside the combustion chamber,asecond,largerdiameter tube conducts air around the combustion tube'soutersurface, andasecondfanblowsthewarmedairintotubingtodirect ittowardstheinterioroftheaircraft.Mostgasolineheaters can produce between 5,000and50.000 British Thermal Units (BTU)perhour.  

Fuel fired heatersrequire electricity to operate and are compatible with a 12-volt and 24-volt aircraft electrical system. The heater requires routine maintenance, such as regular inspection of the combustion tube and replacement of theigniter at periodic intervals.Because gasoline heaters are required to be vented, special care must be made to ensure the vents do not leak into the interior of the aircraft.Combustion byproducts include soot, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and some carbon monoxide. An improperly adjusted, fueled, or poorly maintained fuel heater canbe dangerous.  

# Exhaust Heating Systems  

Exhaustheating systems are thesimplest type of aircraft heating system and are used on most light aircraft.Exhaust heatingsystems areused to route exhaust gases awayfrom the engine and fuselage while reducing engine noise. The exhaust systems also serve as a heat source for the cabin andcarburetor.  

The risks of operating an aircraft with a defective exhaust heating system include carbon monoxide poisoning,a decrease in engine performance, and an increased potential forfire.Because of these risks,technicians should be aware of the rate of exhaust heatingsystem deterioration and should thoroughly inspect all areas of the exhaust heating system to look for deficiencies inside and out.  

# Combustion Heater Systems  

Combustion heaters or surface combustion heaters are often used to heat the cabin of larger, more expensive aircraft. This type of heater burns the aircraft's fuel in a combustion chamber or tube to develop required heat,and the air flowing around the tube is heated and ducted to the cabin. A combustion heater is an airtight burner chamber with a stainless-steel jacket. Fuel from the aircraft fuel system is ignited and burns to provide heat.Ventilation air is forced over the airtightburn chamber picking up heat,whichis then dispersedintothecabin area.  

When the heater control switch is turned on, airflow,ignition, andfuel are supplied totheheater.Airflow and ignition are constantwithin theburner chamber whiletheheater control switch is on. When heat is required, the temperature control is advanced, activating the thermostat. The thermostat (which senses ventilation air temperature) turns on the fuel solenoid allowing fuel to spray into the burner chamber. Fuel mixes with air inside the chamber and is ignited by the spark plug. producingheat.  

The by-product, carbon monoxide, leaves the aircraft through the heater exhaust pipe.Air flowing over the outside of the burner chamber and inside the jacket of the heater absorbs the heat and carries it through ducts into the cabin.As the thermostat reaches its preset temperature,it turns off the fuel solenoid and stops theflow of fuel into the burner chamber. When ventilation air cools to the point that the thermostat again turns the fuel solenoid on, the burner starts again  

This method of heat is very safe as an overheat switch is provided on all combustion heaters,which is wired into theheater'selectrical system toshutoff thefuelin thecase ofmalfunction.In the unlikely event that the heater fuel solenoid,located at theheater,remains open or the control switches fail, the remote fuel solenoid and/or fuel pump is shut off by themechanical overheatswitch,stopping all fuel flowtothesystem.  

As opposed to the fuel fired cabin heaters that are used onmost single-engine aircraft,it isunlikelyfor carbon monoxide poisoning to occur in combustion heaters. Combustion heaters have low pressure in the combustion tube that is vented through its exhaust into the air stream.The ventilation a iron the outside of the combustion chamber is of higher pressure than on the inside, and ram air increases the pressure on the outside of the combustion tube. In the event a leak would develop in the combustion chamber,the higher-pressure air outside the chamber would travel into the chamber and out the exhaust.  

# Bleed Air Heating Systems  

Bleedairheatingsystemsareusedonturbine-engine aircraft.Extremely hot compressor bleed air is ducted into a chamber where it is mixed with ambient or re-circulated air to cool the air to a useable temperature. The air mixture is then ducted into the cabin. This type of system contains several safety features to include temperature sensors that prevent excessive heat from entering the cabin,check valves toprevent a lossof compressor bleed air when starting the engine and when full power is required, and engine sensors to eliminate the bleed system if the engine becomes inoperative.  

# Electrical System  

Most aircraft are equipped with either a 14-or a 28-volt direct current (DC)electrical system.A basic aircraft electrical system consists of thefollowing components:  

Alternator/generator  

Battery Master/batteryswitch Alternator/generatorswitch Bus bar, fuses, and circuit breakers Voltage regulator Ammeter/loadmeter Associated electrical wiring  

Engine-driven alternators or generators supply electric current to the electrical system.They also maintain a sufficient electrical charge in the battery.Electrical energy stored in a battery provides a source of electrical power for starting the engine and a limited supply of electrical power forusein the event the alternator or generator fails.  

Most DC generators do not produce a sufficient amount of electrical current at low engine rpm to operate the entire electrical system. During operations at low engine rpm, the electrical needs must be drawn from the battery,which can quickly be depleted.  

Alternators have several advantages over generators. Alternators produce sufficient current to operate the entire electrical system,even at slowerengine speeds,by producing alternating current (AC), which is converted to DC. The electrical output of an alternator is more constant throughout a wide range of engine speeds  

Some aircraft have receptacles towhich an external ground power unit (GPU) may be connected to provide electrical energyfor starting.These areveryuseful,especially during cold weather starting.Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for engine starting using a GPU.  

The electrical system is turned on or off with amasterswitch. TurningthemasterswitchtotheONpositionprovides electrical energy to all the electrical equipment circuits except the ignition system.Equipment that commonly uses the electrical system for its source of energy includes:  

Position lights Anticollision lights Landing lights Taxi lights Interior cabin lights Instrument lights Radio equipment Turn indicator Fuel gauges  

Electric fuel pump Stall warning system Pitot heat Starting motor  

Many aircraft are equipped with a battery switch that controls the electrical power to the aircraft in a manner similar to the master switch.Inaddition,an alternators witch is installed that permits the pilot to exclude the alternator from the electrical system in the event of alternator failure. [Figure7-33]  

With the alternatorhalf of the switchin the OFF position,the entire electrical loadis placed onthebattery.All nonessential electrical equipment should be turned off to conserve batterypower.  

A busbaris used as a terminalin the aircraft electrical system toconnect themain electrical system to the equipment using electricity as a source of power. This simplifies the wiring system and provides a common point from which voltage can bedistributed throughout the system.[Figure7-34]  

Fuses or circuit breakers are used in the electrical system to protect the circuits and equipment from electrical overload. Spa refuses of the proper amperage limit should be carried in the aircraft to replace defective orblown fuses. Circuit breakers have the same function as a fuse but can be manually reset, rather than replaced, if an overload condition occurs in the electrical system.Placards at the fuse or circuit breaker panel identify the circuit by name and show the amperage limit  

![](images/d7237243b39de976f00ca506309e6137c717f58d170ae7cce7d6172cb4beb665.jpg)  
Figure7-33.On this master switch,the left half is for the alternator and the right half is for the battery.  

An ammeter is used to monitor the performance of the aircraft electrical system.The ammeter shows if the alternator/ generator is producing an adequate supply of electrical power. It also indicates whether or not the battery is receiving an electrical charge.  

Ammeters are designed with the zero point in the center of the face and a negative or positive indication on either side.[Figure7-35]Whenthepointeroftheammeteris on the plus side, it shows the charging rate of the battery. A minus indication means more current is being drawn from the battery than is being replaced. A full-scale minus deflection indicates a malfunction of the alternator/generator. A full-scale positive deflection indicates a malfunction of the regulator.In either case,consult the AFM/POH for appropriate action to betaken.  

Not all aircraft are equipped with an ammeter.Somehave a warning light that, when lighted, indicates a discharge in the system as a generator/alternator malfunction.Refer to the AFM/POH for appropriate action to betaken.  

Another electrical monitoring indicator is a load meter. This type of gauge has a scale beginning with zero and shows the load being placed on the alternator/generator. [Figure7-35] Theloadmeter reflects the totalpercentage of the load placed on the generating capacity of the electrical systemby the electrical accessories andbattery.When all electrical components are turned off, it reflects only the amount of charging current demanded by the battery.  

A voltage regulator controls therate of chargeto thebattery by stabilizing the generator or alternator electrical output.The generator/alternator voltage output should be higher than the batteryvoltage.Forexample,a 12-volt battery would be fed by agenerator/alternator systemof approximately 14 volts. The difference in voltage keeps the battery charged  

# Hydraulic Systems  

There are multiple applications for hydraulic use in aircraft, depending on the complexity of the aircraft. For example, a hydraulic system is often used on small airplanes to operate wheel brakes, retractable landing gear, and some constant- speed propellers. On large airplanes, a hydraulic system is used for flight control surfaces, wing flaps, spoilers, and othersystems.  

A basic hydraulic system consists of a reservoir,pump (either hand, electric, or engine-driven), a filter to keep the fluid clean, a selector valve to control the direction of flow, a reliefvalve to relieve excess pressure,and an actuator. [Figure7-36]  

![](images/774ee06aef761f802d7237a64bf619fce5a166f118aa42ebfcedce59ed50d92f.jpg)  
Figure7-34.Electrical system schematic  

The hydraulic fluid is pumped through the system to an actuatororservo.A servo is a cylinder with a piston inside that turns fluid power into work and creates the power needed to move an aircraft system or flight control.Servoscanbe either single-acting or double-acting,based on the needs of thesystem.This means that the fluid can be applied to one or both sides of the servo, depending on the servo type.A single-acting servoprovides power in one direction.The selector valve allows the fluid direction to be controlled. This is necessary for operations such as the extension and retraction of landing gear during which the fluid must work in two different directions.The relief valve provides an outlet  

![](images/450aeef9a8c6935283170ecd6d18315ef8229bbf4a47f38358b60a648b3f7210.jpg)  
Figure7-35.Ammeter and load meter  

for thesystem in the event of excessive fluid pressurein the system.Each system incorporates different components to meet the individual needs of different aircraft.  

A mineral-based hydraulic fluid is the most widely used type for small aircraft. This type of hydraulic fluid, a kerosene-like petroleum product,has good lubricating properties,as well as additives to inhibit foaming and prevent the formation ofcorrosion.It is chemically stable,has very little viscosity change with temperature, and is dyed for identification. Since several types of hydraulicfluids are commonly used, an aircraft must be serviced with the type specified by the manufacturer. RefertotheAFM/POH or the Maintenance Manual.  

# Landing Gear  

The landing gear forms the principal support of an aircraft on the surface.The most common type oflandinggear consists ofwheels,but aircraft can also be equipped with floats for water operations or skis for landing onsnow.[Figure7-37] The landing gear on small aircraft consists of three wheels: twomainwheels(onelocatedoneachsideofthefuselage) and a third wheel positioned either at the front or rear of the  

![](images/57289c33397172a7e14bb36e90ba36674b9ee54f1fecdf72c55bd9e565c1e97b.jpg)

Figure7-37.The landing gear supports the airplane during the takeoffrun,landing,taxiing,andwhenparked  

airplane. Landing gear employing a rear-mounted wheel is called conventional landing gear.Airplanes with conventional landing gear are often referred to as tail wheel airplanes.When the third wheel is located on the nose,it is called a nose wheel, and the design is referred to as a tricycle gear.Asteerable nose wheel or tail wheel permits the airplane to be controlled throughout all operations while on the ground.  

# Tricycle Landing Gear  

There are three advantages to using tricycle landing gear?  

1. It allows more forceful application of the brakes during landings at high speeds without causing the aircraft to nose over. 2. It permits better forward visibility for the pilot during takeoff, landing, and taxiing. 3. It tends to prevent ground looping (swerving) by providing more directional stability during ground operation since the aircraft's center of gravity (CG) is forward of themain wheels.Theforward CG keeps the airplane moving forward in a straight line rather than ground looping  

Nose wheels are either steerable or caste ring.Steerable nosewheels are linked to the rudders by cables or rods,while caste ring nose wheels are free to swivel.Inbothcases,the aircraft is steeredusing therudder pedals.Airplaneswith a caste ring nose wheel may require the pilot to combine the use of the rudder pedals with independent use of the brakes.  

# TailwheelLandingGear  

Tailwheellandinggearairplaneshavetwomainwheels attached to the airframe ahead of its CG that support most of the weight of the structure.A tailwheel at theveryback of the fuselage provides a third point of support. This arrangement allows adequate ground clearance for a larger propeller and is more desirablefor operations on un improved fields [Figure7-38]  

With the CG located behind the main landing gear, directional control using this type oflanding gear is more difficult while ontheground.This is the main disadvantage of the tail wheel landing gear. For example, if the pilot allows the aircraft to swerve while rolling on the ground at a low speed,heor she may not have sufficient rudder control andtheCGwill attempt to get ahead of the maingear,which may cause the airplanetogroundloop.  

Diminished forward visibility when the tail wheel is on or near the ground is a second disadvantage of tailwheel landing gear airplanes.Because of these disadvantages,specific training is required to operate tailwheel airplanes  

# Fixed and Retractable Landing Gear  

Landinggearcanalsobeclassifiedaseither fixedor retractable.Fixedlandinggear alwaysremainsextended and has the advantage of simplicity combined with low

Figure7-38.Tail wheel landing gear.  

maintenance. Retractable landing gear is designed to streamline the airplane by allowing the landing gear to be stowed inside the structure during cruising flight [Figure7-39]  

# Brakes  

Airplane brakes are located on the main wheels and are applied byeither ahandcontrol orbyfoot pedals (toe or heel) Foot pedals operate independently and allow for differential braking. During ground operations, differential braking can supplement nose wheel/tail wheel steering.  

# Pressurized Aircraft  

Aircraft areflown athigh altitudesfor tworeasons.First, an aircraft flown at high altitude consumes less fuel for a given airspeed than it doesfor the same speed at alower altitude because the aircraft is more efficient at a high altitude. Second, bad weather and turbulence may be avoided by flying in relatively smooth air above the storms.Manymodern aircraft are being designed to operate at high altitudes, taking advantage of that environment.In order to fly at higher altitudes, the aircraft must be pressurized or suitable supplemental oxygen must be provided for each occupant. It is important for pilots who fly these aircraft tobe familiar with thebasic operating principles.  

In a typical pressurization system,the cabin,flight compartment, and baggage compartments are incorporated into a sealed unit capable of containing air under a pressure higher than outside atmospheric pressure. On aircraft powered by turbine engines, bleed air from the engine compressor section is used to pressurize the cabin. Superchargers may be used on older model turbine-powered aircraft to pump air into the sealed fuselage.Piston-powered aircraft may use air supplied from each engine turbocharger through a sonic venturi (flow limiter). Air is released from the fuselage by  

![](images/b1a23d2e68cf98ba23cadcb465ac84d810d85574b3fa1a95a32369b69cc058fe.jpg)  
Figure7-39.Fixed(left)andretractable(right)gearairplanes.  

a device called an outflow valve. By regulating the air exit the outflowvalve allowsfor a constant inflow of air to the pressurizedarea.[Figure7-40]  

A cabin pressurization system typically maintains a cabin pressure altitude of approximately 8,000feet atthemaximum designed cruising altitude of an aircraft. This prevents rapid changes of cabin altitude that maybe uncomfortable or cause injury to passengers and crew. In addition, the pressurization system permits a reasonably fast exchange of airfrom the inside to the outside of the cabin.This is necessary to eliminate odors and to removes tale air.[Figure7-41]  

Pressurization of the aircraft cabin is necessary in order to protect occupants against hypoxia.Within a pressurized cabin,occupantscanbetransportedcomfortablyandsafely for long periods of time, particularly if the cabin altitude ismaintainedat8,ooofeetorbelow,wheretheuseof oxygen equipment is not required. The flight crew in this type of aircraft must be aware of the danger of accidental loss of cabin pressure and be prepared to deal with such an emergency whenever it occurs.

Figure 7-41. Standard atmospheric pressure chart  

The following terms will aid in understanding the operating principles of pressurization and air conditioning systems:  

Aircraft altitudethe actualheight abovesealevel at which the aircraft isflying Ambient temperature—the temperature in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft Ambientpressure—the pressure in the area immediately surrounding the aircraft Cabin altitude—-cabin pressure in terms of equivalent altitudeabovesealevel Differential pressure—the difference in pressure between the pressure acting on onesideof awall and the pressure acting on the other side of the wall.In aircraft air-conditioning and pressurizing systems, it is the difference between cabin pressure and atmospheric pressure.  

The cabinpressure control systemprovides cabinpressure regulation,pressurerelief,vacuumrelief,andthemeans for selecting the desired cabin altitude in the isobaric and differential range. In addition, dumping of the cabin pressure is a function of the pressure control system.A cabin pressure regulator,anoutflowvalve,and a safety valve are used tc accomplish these functions.  

The cabin pressure regulator controls cabin pressure to a selected valuein theisobaric range and limits cabinpressure to a preset differential value in the differential range. When an aircraft reaches the altitude at which the difference between the pressure inside and outside the cabin is equal to the highest differential pressurefor which the fuselage structure is designed,a further increase in aircraft altitude will result in a corresponding increase in cabin altitude. Differential controlis used to prevent themaximum differential pressure for which the fuselage was designed, from being exceeded. This differential pressure is determined by the structural strength of the cabin and often by the relationship of the cabin size to the probable areas of rupture,suchaswindow areasanddoors.  

The cabin air pressure safety valve is a combination pressure relief, vacuum relief, and dump valve. The pressure reliefvalve preventscabin pressure from exceeding a predetermined differential pressure above ambient pressure. The vacuum relief prevents ambient pressure from exceeding cabin pressure by allowing external air to enter the cabin when ambient pressure exceeds cabin pressure. The flight deck control switch actuates the dump valve.Whenthis switch is positioned to ram, a solenoid valve opens, causing the valve to dump cabin air into the atmosphere.  

The degree of pressurization and the operating altitude of the aircraft are limited by several critical design factors. Primarily,the fuselage is designed towithstand aparticular maximum cabin differential pressure.  

Several instruments are used in conjunction with the pressurization controller. The cabin differential pressure gauge indicates the difference betweeninside and outsidepressure. This gauge should be monitored to assure that the cabin does not exceed the maximum allowable differential pressure.A cabin altimeteris alsoprovided as a checkon theperformance ofthesystem.Insomecases,these two instruments are combinedintoone.A third instrument indicates thecabinrate of climb or descent.Acabinrate-of-climbinstrument and a cabin altimeter are illustrated in Figure 7-42  

Decompression is defined as the inability of the aircraft's pressurization system to maintain its designed pressure differential.This can be caused by a malfunction in the pressurization system or structural damage to the aircraft  

Physiologically, decompressions fall into the following two categories:  

Explosive decompressiona changein cabinpressure faster than the lungs can decompress, possibly resulting in lung damage. Normally, the time required torelease airfrom thelungs without restrictions,such as masks, is 0.2 seconds. Most authorities consider any decompression that occurs inless than 0.5seconds to be explosive and potentially dangerous. Rapid decompression—a change in cabin pressure in which thelungs decompress faster than the cabin.  

During an explosive decompression,theremaybenoise andonemayfeeldazedforamoment.Thecabinairfills with fog, dust, or flying debris. Fog occurs due to the rapid drop in temperature and the change of relative humidity. Normally,the ears clear automatically.Air rushes from the mouth and nose due to the escape of air from the lungs and maybe noticed by some individuals.  

Rapid decompression decreases the period of useful consciousness because oxygen in the lungs is exhaled rapidly. reducing pressure on the body. This decreases the partial pressure of oxygen in theblood and reduces the pilot's effective performance time by one-thirdtoone-fourthits normal time. For this reason, an oxygen mask should be worn when flying at very high altitudes (35,000 feet or higher). It is recommended that the crewmembers select the 100 percent oxygen setting on the oxygen regulator at high altitudeif theaircraftisequippedwith ademand orpressure demandoxygensystem.  

![](images/4ba67741ea740272b23c41c2ca9d08a261b78e203ea0b9290a22a514876ace16.jpg)  
Figure7-42.Cabin pressurization instruments  

The primary danger of decompression is hypoxia. Quick proper utilization of oxygenequipment isnecessaryto avoid unconsciousness. Another potential danger that pilots, crew, and passengers face during high altitude decompressions is evolved gas decompression sickness.This occurs when the pressure on the body drops sufficiently, nitrogen comes out ofsolution,and forms bubbles inside the person that can have adverse effects on somebody tissues.  

Decompression caused by structural damage to the aircraft presentsanothertypeofdangertopilots,crew,and passengers—being tossed or blown out of the aircraft if they are located near openings.Individuals near openings should wear safety harnesses or seatbelts at all times when the aircraft is pressurized and they are seated. Structural damage also has the potential to expose them to wind blasts and extremely cold temperatures.  

Rapid descentfrom altitude is necessary in order to minimize these problems.Automatic visual and aural warning systems are included in the equipment of all pressurized aircraft.  

# Oxygen Systems  

Crew and passengers use oxygen systems, in conjunction with pressurization systems, to prevent hypoxia. Regulations require, at a minimum, flight crews have and use supplemental oxygen after 30minutes exposure tocabin pressure altitudes between 12,500 and 14,000 feet. Use of supplemental oxygen is required immediately upon exposure to cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000feet.Every aircraft occupant, above15,0 o 0 feet cabin pressure altitude,musthave supplemental oxygen.However, based on a person's physical characteristics and condition, a person may feel the effects of oxygen deprivation at much lower altitudes. Some people flying above1o,oo 0 feet during the day may experience disorientation due to the lack of adequate oxygen.At night, especially when fatigued, these effects may occur as low as 5,000 feet. Therefore, for optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above10,000feet cabin altitude during the day and above 5,Oo0feetatnight  

Most high altitude aircraft come equippedwith some type of fixed oxygen installation.If the aircraft does not have a fixed installation, portable oxygen equipment must be readily accessible during flight. The portable equipment usually consists of a container, regulator, mask outlet, and pressure gauge. Aircraft oxygen is usually stored in high pressure system containers of 1,800-2,200 psi. When the ambient temperature surrounding an oxygen cylinder decreases, pressure within that cylinder decreases because pressure varies directly with temperature if the volume of a gas remains constant. A drop in the indicated pressure of a supplemental oxygen cylinder maybe due to the container being stored in an unheated area of the aircraft rather than an actual depletion of the oxygen supply. High pressure oxygen containers should be marked with the psi tolerance (i.e., 1,800 psi) before filling the container to that pressure. The containers should be suppliedwith oxygen thatmeets or exceeds SAE AS8010(as revised),Aviator'sBreathing Oxygen Purity Standard.Toassuresafety,periodic inspection andservicing of the oxygensystem should beperformed.  

An oxygen system consists of a mask or cannula and a regulator that supplies a flow of oxygen dependent upon cabin altitude. Most regulators approved for use up to 40,000 feet are designed to provide zero percent cylinder oxygen and 100 percent cabin air at cabin altitudes of 8,000 feet or less, with the ratio changing to 100 percent oxygen and zero percent cabin air at approximately 34,000feet cabin altitude. [Figure 7-43] Most regulators approved up to 45,000 feet are designed to provide 40 percent cylinder oxygen and 60 percent cabin air at lower altitudes, with the ratio changing to1o0percent at the higher altitude.  

Pilots should be aware of the danger of fire when using oxygen. Materials that are nearly fireproof in ordinary air may be susceptible to combustion in oxygen. Oils and greases may ignite if exposed to oxygen and cannot be used for sealing the valves and fittings of oxygen equipment. Smoking during any kind of oxygen equipment use is prohibited. Before each flight, the pilot should thoroughly inspect and test all oxygen equipment. The inspection should include a thorough examination of the aircraft oxygen equipment,including available supply, an operational check of the system, and assurance that the supplemental oxygen is readily accessible. The inspection should be accomplished with clean hands and should include a visual inspection of the mask and tubing for tears, cracks, or deterioration; the regulator for valve and lever condition and positions; oxygen quantity; and the location and functioning of oxygen pressure gauges, flow indicators,and connections.The mask should be donned and thesystem should be tested.After any oxygen use,verify that all components and valves are shut off.  

![](images/93cf56bd00d67b58705f6f7cfc65810bf4f241a42c7c92c981b67016145fb71c.jpg)  
Figure7-43.Oxygen system regulator  

# Oxygen Masks  

There are numerous types and designs of oxygen masks in use. The most important factor in oxygen mask use is to ensure that the masks and oxygen system are compatible. Crewmasksarefittedtotheuser'sfacewithaminimumoff leakage and usually contain a microphone.Mostmasksare the oro nasal type that covers only the mouth and nose.  

A passenger mask maybe a simple,cup-shaped rubber molding sufficiently flexible to obviate individual fitting. It may have a simple elastic head strap or the passenger may hold it to his or her face.  

All oxygen masks should bekept clean to reduce the danger of infection and prolong the life of themask.Tocleanthe mask,was hit with a mild soap and water solution and rinse it with clear water. If a microphone is installed, use a clean swab, instead of running water, to wipe off the soapy solution. The mask should also be disinfected. A gauze pad that has been soaked in a water solution of Mer th io late can be used toswabout themask.This solution used should contain one-fifth teaspoon of Merthiolateper quart of water.Wipe the mask with a clean cloth and air dry.  

# Cannula  

A cannula is an ergonomicpiece of plastic tubing that runs under the nose to administer oxygen to the user.[Figure7-44] Can nul as are typically more comfortable than masks,but may not provide an adequate flow of oxygen asreliablyas masks when operating at higher altitudes.Airplanes certified to older regulations had can nul as installed with an on-board  

![](images/821665e80a7e4a0ebf97a9fa7f17302554350c17dad276efc093d2d44d7b1097.jpg)  
Figure7-44.Can nul a with green flow detector  

oxygen system.However, current regulations require aircraft with oxygen systems installed and certified for operations above18,000feettobeequippedwithoxygenmasksinstead of cannulas.Many can nul as have a flow meter in the oxygen supplyline.If equipped,a periodic check of the greenflow detector should be a part of the pilot's regular scan.  

# Diluter-Demand OxygenSystems  

Diluter-demand oxygen systems supply oxygen only when the user inhales through the mask. An automix lever allows the regulators to automatically mix cabin air and oxygen or supply 100 percent oxygen, depending on the altitude. The demand mask provides a tight seal over theface toprevent dilution with outside air and can be used safely up to 40,000 feet.A pilot who has a beard or mustache should be sure it is trimmed in a manner thatwill not interferewith the sealing of the oxygen mask. The fit of the mask around the beard on mustache should be checked on the ground for proper sealing  

# Pressure-Demand Oxygen Systems  

Pressure-demand oxygen systems are similar to diluter demand oxygen equipment, except that oxygen is supplied to the mask under pressure at cabin altitudes above 34,000feet. Pressure-demand regulators create airtight and oxygen-tight seals, but they also provide a positive pressure application of oxygen to the mask face piece that allows the user's lungs to be pressurized with oxygen. This feature makes pressure demand regulators safe at altitudes above 40,000feet. Some systems may have a pressure demand mask with the regulator attached directly to themask,rather than mounted on the instrument panel or other area within the flight deck. The mask-mounted regulator eliminates the problem of a long hose that must be purged of air before 100 percent oxygen begins flowing into the mask.  

# Continuous-Flow Oxygen System  

Continuous-flow oxygen systems are usually provided for passengers. The passenger mask typically has a reservoir bagthat collects oxygenfrom the continuous-flow oxygen system during the time when the mask user is exhaling. The oxygen collected in the reservoir bag allows a higher aspiratory flow rate during the inhalation cycle,which reduces the amount of air dilution.Ambient air is added to the supplied oxygen during inhalation after thereservoirbag oxygen supply is depleted.The exhaled air is released to the cabin.[Figure7-45]  

# Electrical Pulse-Demand Oxygen System  

Portable electrical pulse-demand oxygen systems deliver oxygen by detecting an individual's inhalation effort and provide oxygen flow during the initial portion of inhalation. Pulse demand systems do not waste oxygen during the  

![](images/3a5be16650e87928169081a7197461ea72e1afbde7e45f3167bb82108d6cd109.jpg)  
Figure7-45.Continuous flow mask andre breather bag  

breathing cyclebecause oxygen is only delivered during inhalation. Compared to continuous-flow systems, the pulse- demand method of oxygen delivery canreduce the amount ofoxygenneededby50-85percent.Mostpulse-demand oxygensystems alsoincorporate an internal barometer that automatically compensates for changes in altitude by increasing the amount of oxygen deliveredfor eachpulse as altitude is increased.[Figure7-46]  

# Pulse Oximeters  

A pulse oxime ter is a device that measures the amount of oxygen in an individual's blood, in addition to heart rate. Thisnon-invasive device measures the color changesthat red blood cells undergo when they become saturated with oxygen.By transmitting a special light beam through a fingertip to evaluate thecolor of theredcells,a pulse oximetercancalculatethedegreeofoxygensaturation within one percent of directly measured blood oxygen. Because of their portability andspeed,pulse oximeters are very useful for pilots operating in nonpressurized aircraft above 12,500 feet where supplemental oxygen is required. A pulse oxime ter permits crewmembers and passengers of an aircraft to evaluate their actual need for supplemental oxygen.[Figure7-47]  

# Servicing of Oxygen Systems  

Before servicing any aircraft with oxygen,consult the specific aircraft service manual to determine the type of equipment required and procedures to be used.Certain precautions should be observed whenever aircraft oxygen  

![](images/263b839c36a010fe7033d53ed8081afc1b6d1ae49a588a1fffef1060b3ed323d.jpg)  
Figure7-46.EDS-011 portablepulse-demand oxygensystem.  

systems are to be serviced. Oxygen system servicing should be accomplished only when the aircraft is located outside of the hangars. Personal cleanliness and good housekeeping areimperative when working with oxygen.Oxygen under pressure creates spontaneous results whenbrought in contact with petroleum products.Service people should be certain to wash dirt, oil, and grease (including lip salves and hair oil) from their hands before working around oxygen equipment. It is also essential that clothing and tools are free of oil, grease,

and dirt. Aircraft with permanently installed oxygen tanks usually require twopersons to accomplish servicing of the system. One should be stationed at the service equipment controlvalves,and the other stationed where he or she can observe the aircraft system pressure gauges. Oxygen system servicing is not recommended during aircraft fueling operations or while other work is performed that could provide asource ofignition.Oxygensystem servicingwhile passengers are onboard the aircraft is not recommended.  

# Anti-lce and Deice Systems  

Anti-icing equipment is designed to prevent the formation of ice, while deicing equipment is designed to remove ice once it has formed. These systems protect the leading edge of wing and tail surfaces, pitot and static port openings, fuel tankvents,stall warning devices,windshields,and propeller blades. Ice detection lighting may also be installed on some aircraft to determine the extent of structural icing during nightflights.  

Most light aircraft have only a heated pit ot tube and are not certifiedfor flightinicing.Theselight aircraft have limited cross-country capability in the cooler climates during late fall,winter,andearly spring.Noncertificated aircraft must exit icing conditions immediately.RefertotheAFM/POH fordetails.  

# AirfoilAnti-lceandDeice  

Inflatabledeicingbootsconsistofarubbersheetbondedto the leading edge of the airfoil.When ice builds upon the leading edge, an engine-driven pneumatic pump inflates the rubber boots. Many turboprop aircraft divert engine bleed air to the wing to inflate the rubberboots.Uponinflation, the ice is cracked and should falloff the leading edge of the wing. Deicing boots are controlled from the flight deck by a switch and can be operated in a single cycle or allowed to cycleatautomatic,timedintervals.[Figure7-48]  

In the past, it was believed that if the boots were cycled too soon after encountering ice, the ice layer would expand instead of breaking off, resulting in a condition referred to as ice "bridging."Consequently, subsequent deice boot cycles would be ineffective at removing the icebuildup. Although some residual ice may remain after a boot cycle, “bridging' does not occur with any modern boots. Pilots can cycle the boot sassoon as a nice accumulation is observed.Consult theAFM/POH for information on the operation of deice boots on an aircraft  

Many deicing boot systems use the instrument system suction gauge and a pneumatic pressure gauge to indicate proper boot operation.These gauges have range markings that indicate the operating limits for boot operation.Somesystemsmay

Figure6-48.Deicing boots on the leading edge of the wing  

also incorporate an annunciator light to indicate proper boot operation.  

Proper maintenance and care of deicingboots areimportant for continued operation of thissystem.Theyneed tobe carefully inspected during preflight.  

Another type of leading edge protection is thethermal anti-ice system.Heatprovides one of the most effective methods for preventingice accumulation on an airfoil.Highperformance turbine aircraft often direct hot air from the compressor section of the engine to the leading edge surfaces. The hot airheats theleadingedge surfaces sufficiently toprevent the formationofice.Anewer typeof thermalanti-icesystem referred to as The rma Wing uses electrically heated graphite foil laminate applied to the leading edge of the wing and horizontal stabilizer. ThermaWing systems typically have two zones of heat application. One zone on the leading edge receives continuous heat;the second zone further aftreceives heat in cycles to dislodge the ice allowing aerodynamic forces to remove it. Thermal anti-ice systems should be activated prior to entering icing conditions.  

An alternatetypeof leading edge protection thatisnot as common as thermal anti-ice and deicing boots is known as a weeping wing. The weeping-wing design uses small holes located in the leading edge of the wing to prevent the formation and build-upofice.An antifreeze solution is pumped to the leading edge and weeps out through the holes. Additionally, the weeping wing is capable of deicing an aircraft.Whenice has accumulated on theleading edges, application of the antifreeze solution chemically breaks down the bond between the ice and airframe, allowing aerodynamic forces to remove the ice.[Figure7-49]  

# Windscreen Anti-lce  

There are two main types of windscreen anti-icesystems. The first system directs a flow of alcohol to the windscreen. If used early enough,the alcohol prevents ice from building up on thewindscreen.Therateof alcohol flow can be controlled by a dial in the flight deck according to procedures recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.  

Another effective method of anti-icing equipment is the electric heating method.Small wires or other conductive material isimbeddedin thewindscreen.Theheatercanbe turned on by a switch in the flight deck,causing an electrical current to be passed across the shield through the wires to provide sufficientheat toprevent the formation of ice on the windscreen.Theheated windscreen should only be used during flight. Do not leave it on during ground operations, as it can overheat and cause damage to the windscreen. Warning: the electrical currentcan cause compass deviationerrors by asmuchas  $40^{\circ}$  

# Propeller Anti-lce  

Propellers are protected from icing by the use of alcoholor electrically heated elements. Some propellers are equipped with a discharge nozzle that is pointed toward the root of the blade.Alcoholis dischargedfromthenozzles,and centrifugal force drives the alcohol down theleadingedge of theblade. The boots are also grooved to help direct the flow of alcohol. This prevents ice fromforming on the leading edge of the propeller.Propellers can alsobe fitted with propeller anti-ice boots. The propeller boot is divided into two sections—the  

![](images/509ffa1aa07ac468f8ec594e6a8e0c31b6da59f055f02bd4575f26cfe92e2e6e.jpg)

in board and the outboard sections.The boots are imbedded with electrical wires that carry current for heating the propeller.The prop anti-ice system canbe monitored for proper operation by monitoring the prop anti-ice ammeter. During the preflight inspection, check the propeller boots for proper operation. If a boot fails to heat one blade, an unequal blade loading can result and may cause severe propeller vibration.[Figure7-50]  

# OtherAnti-lcea nd Deice Systems  

Pitot andstatic ports,fuelvents,stall-warning sensors, and other optional equipment maybe heated by electrical elements.Operational checksof the electrically heated systems are to be checked in accordance with the AFM/POH  

Operation of aircraft anti-icing and deicing systems should be checked prior to encountering icing conditions.Encounters with structural ice require immediate action. Anti-icing and deicing equipment arenot intended tosustainlong-termflight in icing conditions.

# Flight nstruments  

# Introduction  

In order to safely fly any aircraft,a pilot must understand how to interpret and operate the flight instruments. The pilot also needs to be able to recognize associated errors and malfunctions of these instruments.This chapter addresses the pitot-static system and associated instruments, the vacuum system and related instruments, gyroscopic instruments, and the magnetic compass. When a pilot understands how each instrument works and recognizes when an instrument is malfunctioning,he or she can safely utilize theinstruments to their fullest potential.  

# Pitot-Static Flight Instruments  

The pitot-static system is a combined system that utilizes the static air pressure and the dynamic pressure due to the motion of the aircraft through the air.These combined pressures are utilized for the operation of the airspeed indicator (Asl), altimeter, and vertical speed indicator (VSI). [Figure 8-1]

# ImpactPressure Chamber and Lines  

The pitot tube is utilized to measure the total combined pressures that are present when an aircraft moves through the air. Static pressure, also known as ambient pressure, is always present whether an aircraft is moving or atrest.It is simply the barometric pressure in the local area. Dynamic pressureispresentonlywhenanaircraftisinmotion; therefore,it canbe thought of as a pressure due tomotion. Wind also generates dynamic pressure. It does not matter if the aircraft is moving through still air at 7o knots or if the aircraft is facing a wind with a speed of 7 o knots,thesame dynamic pressure is generated.  

When the wind blows from an angle less than  $90°$  Offthe nose of the aircraft,dynamic pressure can be depicted on the ASI.Thewindmovingacrosstheairfoilat20knotsisthe same as the aircraft moving through calm air at 20 knots. The pit ot tube captures the dynamic pressure,aswellasthe static pressure that is alwayspresent.  

Thepitot tubehas a small opening at thefront that allows the total pressure to enter the pressure chamber.The total pressure is made up of dynamic pressure plus static pressure. Inadditiontothelargerholeinthefrontofthepitottube thereisasmallholeinthebackofthechamberthatallows moisture to drain from the system should the aircraft enter precipitation.Both openingsin the pitot tubemust bechecked prior to flight to ensure that neither is blocked.Many aircraft have pit ot tube covers installed when they s it for extended periods of time.This helps tokeepbugs and other objects from becoming lodged in theopeningof thepitot tube.  

The one instrument that utilizes the pit ot tube is theASI.The total pressure is transmitted to the AS I from the pit ot tube's pressure chamber via a small tube.The static pressure is alsodelivered to the oppositesideof theASI,whichserves to cancel out the two static pressures, thereby leaving the dynamic pressure to be indicated on the instrument. When the dynamic pressure changes, the ASI shows either increase or decrease, corresponding to the direction of change. The two remaining instruments (altimeter and VSI) utilize only the static pressure that is derived from the static port  

# StaticPressureChamberandLines  

The static chamber is vented through small holes to the free undisturbed a iron the side(s)oftheaircraft.Asthe atmospheric pressure changes,the pressure is able to move freely in and out of the instruments through the small lines that connect the instruments to the static system.Analternate static source is provided in some aircraft to provide static pressure should the primary static source become blocked. The alternate static source is normally found inside the flight deck.Dueto the venturi effect of the airflowing around the fuselage, the air pressure inside the flight deck is lower than the exterior pressure.  

When the alternate static source pressure is used, the following instrument indications are observed:  

1. The altimeter indicates a slightly higher altitude than actual. 2.  The ASI indicates an airspeed greater than the actual airspeed. 3. The VSI shows a momentary climb and then stabilizes if the altitude is held constant.  

Each pilot is responsible for consulting the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) to determine the amount of error that is introduced into the system when utilizing the alternate static source.In anaircraft not equipped with an alternate static source, an alternate method of introducing static pressure into the system should a blockage occur is to break the glass face of theVSI. This most likely renders the VS l inoperative.Thereasonfor choosingtheVSIastheinstrumenttobreakisthatitisthe least important static source instrumentfor flight  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter isaninstrument that measures the height of an aircraft above a given pressure level. Pressure levels are discussed later in detail. Since the altimeter is the only instrument that is capable of indicating altitude,thisisoneof themostvitalinstrumentsinstalledintheaircraft.Tousethe altimeter effectively,the pilot must understand the operation of the instrument, as well as the errors associated with the altimeter and how each affect the indication.  

A stack of sealed a nero id wafers comprise the main component of the altimeter.An a nero id wafer is a sealed wafer that is evacuated to an internal pressure of 29.92 inchesofmercury  $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$  .These wafers are free to expand and contract withchanges tothe staticpressure.Ahigher static pressure presses down on the wafers and causes them to collapse. A lower static pressure (less than  $29.92\ \mathrm{"Hg})$  allows the wafers to expand.A mechanical linkage connects the wafer movement to the needles on the indicator face, which translates compression of the wafers into a decrease in altitude and translates an expansion of the wafers into an increase in altitude.[Figure8-2]  

Notice how the static pressure is introduced into the rear of the sealed altimeter case.Thealtimeter'souter chamber is sealed. which allows the static pressure to surround the aneroid wafers.If the static pressure is higher than thepressurein the aneroidwafers  $(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg})$  ,then the wafers are compressed  

![](images/db854c702f3422878bac7457b76585a13c60e7189b6e2b6a55c45571ec76bc7f.jpg)  
Figure8-2.Altimeter.  

until the pressure inside the wafers is equal to the surrounding staticpressure.Conversely,if the static pressure is less than the pressure inside of the wafers,the wafers are able to expand which increases thevolume.The expansion and contraction of the wafers moves the mechanical linkage which drives the needles on the face of the altimeter.  

# Principle of Operation  

The pressure altimeter is an aneroid barometer that measures the pressure of the atmosphere at the level where the altimeter is located and presents an altitude indication in feet.The altimeter uses static pressure as its source of operation.Airisdenser at sea level than aloftas altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases.This difference in pressure atvariouslevels causes the altimeter to indicate changes in altitude  

Thepresentation of altitudevaries considerably between different types of altimeters. Some have one pointer while others have two or more. Only the multipointer type is discussed in this handbook. The dial of a typical altimeter is graduated with numerals arranged clockwise from zero to nine. Movement of the aneroid element is transmitted through gears to the three hands that indicate altitude.In Figure8-2,thelong,thin needle with the inverted triangle at the end indicates tens of thousands of feet; the short, wide needleindicates thousandsoffeet;and the long needle on top indicates hundreds of feet.  

This indicated altitude is correct,however,only when the sea level barometric pressure is standard  $(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg})$  ,thesea level free air temperature is standard (  $+15$  degreesCelsius  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  or59degreesFahrenheit  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ),and the pressure and temperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase in altitude.Adjustments for nonstandard pressures are accomplished by setting the corrected pressure into a barometric scale located on the face of the altimeter. The barometric pressure windowis sometimes referred to as the Koll s man window;onlyafterthe altimeter is set does it indicate the correct altitude.Theword“correct”willneed to be better explained when referring to types of altitudes, but is commonly used in this case to denote the approximate altitude above sea level.Inotherwords,theindicated altitude refers to the altitude read off of the altitude which is uncorrected, after the barometric pressure setting is dialed into the Koll s man window.The additional types of altitudes are further explained later.  

# Effect of Nonstandard Pressure and Temperature  

It is easy to maintain a consistent height aboveground if the barometric pressure and temperature remain constant, but this is rarely the case. The pressure and temperature can change between takeoff and landing even on a local flight If these changes are not taken into consideration, flight becomes dangerous.  

If altimeterscould not be adjusted for nonstandard pressure,a hazardous situation could occur.Forexample,if an aircraftis flown from a high pressure area to a low pressure area without adjusting the altimeter, a constant altitude will be displayed, but the actual height of the aircraft above the ground would belowerthentheindicatedaltitude.Thereisanoldaviation axiom:"GOINGFROMAHIGHTOALOW,LOOKOUTBELOw."Conversely,if an aircraft is flown from a low pressure area to a high pressure areawithout an adjustment ofthealtimeter,the actual altitude of the aircraft is higher than theindicated altitude.Oncein flight,it isimportant to frequently obtain current altimeter settings en route to ensure terrain and obstruction clearance.  

Many altimeters do not have an accurate means of being adjusted for barometric pressures in excess of 31.00  $"\mathrm{Hg}$  .When the altimeter cannot be set to the higher pressure setting, the aircraft actual altitude is higher than the altimeter indicates.When low barometric pressure conditions occur (below 28.00),flight operations by aircraft unable to set the actual altimeter setting are notrecommended.  

Adjustments to compensate for nonstandard pressure do not compensate for nonstandard temperature. Since cold airisdenser thanwarm air,when operating in temperatures that are colder than standard,the altitude is lower than the altimeter indication.[Figure8-3]It is the magnitude of this "difference” that determines the magnitude of the error. It is the difference due to colder temperatures that concerns the pilot.Whenflyinginto a cooler air mass while maintaining a constant indicated altitude,true altitude is lower.Ifterrainor obstacle clearance is a factor in selecting a cruising altitude, particularly in mountainous terrain, remember to anticipate thatacolder-than-standard temperature places the aircraft lower than the altimeter indicates.Therefore,a higher indicated altitudemay be required toprovide adequate terrain clearance.A variation of the memory aid used for pressure

Figure8-3.Effects of nonstandard temperature on an altimeter  

canbe employed:“FROM HOT TO COLD,LOOK OUT BELOW."When the airis warmer than standard,the aircraft is higher than the altimeter indicates.Altitude corrections fon temperature canbe computed on thenavigation computer.  

Extremely cold temperatures also affect altimeter indications. Figure8-4,which was derived from ICAO formulas, indicateshowmucherrorcanexistwhenthetemperatureis extremelycold.  

# Setting the Altimeter  

Most altimeters are equipped witha barometric pressure settingwindow(or Koll s man window）providingameans to adjust the altimeter.Aknobislocated at thebottom of the instrument for this adjustment.  

To adjust the altimeter for variation in atmospheric pressure the pressure scale in the altimeter setting window, calibrated ininches of mercury  $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  and/or millibars (mb), is adjusted to match the given altimeter setting.Altimeter setting is defined as station pressure reduced to sea level,butan altimeter setting is accurate only in the vicinity of the reporting station.Therefore,the altimeter must be adjusted as the flight progresses from one station to the next.Air traffic control (ATC) will advise when updated altimeter settings areavailable.If a pilot is not utilizingATC assistance, local altimeter settings can be obtained by monitoring local automated weather observing system/automated surface observation system(AWOS/AsOS)or automatic terminal information service(ATIS)broadcasts.  

Many pilots confidently expect the current altimeter setting will compensate for irregularities in atmospheric pressure at all altitudes,but this is not always true. The altimeter setting broadcast byground stations is the station pressure corrected to mean sea level. It does not account for the irregularities  

![](images/5e515a2ae9e980a9d9347f3a5128b41e0f8aebaf469b37b310f13632c28aef58.jpg)  

athigherlevels,particularly the effect of nonstandard temperature.If eachpilot in agiven area is using the same altimeter setting,each altimeter should be equally affected by temperature and pressure variation errors, making it possible to maintain the desired vertical separation between aircraft. This does not guarantee vertical separation though. It is still imperative to maintain a regimented visual scan for intrudingairtraffic.  

When flying over high,mountainous terrain,certain atmospheric conditions cause the altimeter to indicate an altitudeof1,ooofeetormorehigherthantheactualaltitude. For this reason, a generous margin of altitude should be allowed—not only for possible altimeter error, but also for possible downdrafts that might be associated with high winds  

To illustrate the use of the altimeter setting system, follow a flight from Dallas Love Field,Texas,to Abilene Municipal Airport,Texas,via Mineral Wells.Before taking off from Love Field, the pilot receives a current altimeter setting of  $29.85~"\mathrm{Hg}$  from the control tower or AT IS and sets this value in the altimeter setting window.The altimeter indication should then be compared with theknown airport elevation of 487feet. Since most altimeters are not perfectly calibrated. anerrormayexist.  

When over Mineral Wells, assume the pilot receives a current altimeter setting of  $29.94~"\mathrm{Hg}$  and sets this in the altimeter window.Before entering the traffic pattern at Abilene Municipal Airport, a new altimeter setting of  $29.69~"\mathrm{Hg}$  is received from the Abilene Control Tower and set in the altimeter settingwindow.If the pilotdesires tofly the traffic pattern at approximately 800 feet above the terrain, and the field elevation of Abilene is 1,791feet,anindicated altitude of 2,600 feet should be maintained (1,791 feet  $^+$  800feet  $=2{,}591$  feet,roundedto2,600feet).  

The importance of properly setting the altimeter cannot be overemphasized.Assume the pilot did not adjust the altimeter at Abilene to the current setting and continued using the Mineral Wells setting of  $29.94~"\mathrm{Hg}$  .Whenenteringthe Abilene traffic pattern at an indicated altitude of 2,600feet, the aircraft would be approximately 250 feet below the proper traffic pattern altitude. Upon landing, the altimeter would indicate approximately 250 feet higher than the field elevation.  

MineralWells altimeter setting 29.94 Abilene altimeter setting 29.69 Difference 0.25  

(Since1 inchof pressureis equalto approximately1,000feet ofaltitude,  $0.25\times1\small{,}000$  feet  $=250$  feet.)  

When determining whether to add or subtract the amount of altimeter error, remember that when the actual pressure is lower than what is set in the altimeter window,the actual altitude of the aircraft is lower than what is indicated on the altimeter.  

The following is another method of computing the altitude deviation. Start by subtracting the current altimeter setting from  $29.94\,^{\circ}\mathrm{Hg}.$  Always remember to place the original setting as the top number. Then subtract the current altimeter setting.  

Mineral Wells altimeter setting 29.94 Abilene altimeter setting 29.69  $29.94-29.69=$  Difference 0.25  

(Since1 inch ofpressureis equal to approximately1,0o0feet ofaltitude,  $0.25\,\times\,1\small{,}000$  feet  $=250$  feet.)Alwayssubtract the number from the indicated altitude  

$$
2{,}600-250=2{,}350
$$  

Now, try a lower pressure setting. Adjust from altimeter setting29.94 to  $30.56\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  

Mineral Wells altimeter setting 29.94 Altimeter setting 30.56  $29.94-30.56=\mathrm{Diffvphantom}$  -0.62  

(Since1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately1,0o0feet ofaltitude,  $0.62\times1\small{,}000$  feet  $=620$  feet.)Alwayssubtract thenumberfrom the indicated altitude.  

$$
2{,}600-(-620)=3{,}220
$$  

The pilot will be 620 feet high  

Notice the difference is a negative number.Startingwiththe current indicated altitude of 2,600feet, subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the two numbers.By utilizing thismethod,apilotwillbetterunderstandtheimportanceof using the current altimeter setting(miscalculation of where and in whatdirection an error lies can affect safety; if altitude is lower than indicated altitude,an aircraft could be in danger of colliding with an obstacle).  

# Altimeter Operation  

There are two means by which the altimeter pointers can be moved. The first is a change in air pressure, while the other is an adjustment to the barometric scale.Whenthe aircraft climbs or descends, changing pressure within the altimeter case expands or contracts the aneroid barometer. This movement is transmitted through mechanical linkage torotatethepointers.  

A decrease in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate an increase in altitude, and an increase in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate a decrease in altitude.Accordingly,if the aircraft is sitting on the ground with a pressure level of  $29.98~"\mathrm{Hg}$  and the pressure level changes to  $29.68~"\mathrm{Hg}$  the altimeter would show anincrease of approximately 300feet in altitude.Thispressure change is most noticeable when the aircraft is left parked over night. As the pressure falls, the altimeter interprets this as a climb. The altimeter indicates an altitude above the actual field elevation.Ifthebarometric pressuresettingisresettothecurrentaltimetersettingof29.68 'Hg, then the field elevation is again indicated on the altimeter.  

This pressure change is not as easily noticed in flight since aircraft fly at specific altitudes. The aircraft steadily decreases true altitude while the altimeter is held constant through pilo action as discussed in the previous section.  

Knowing the aircraft's altitude is vitally important to a pilot.Thepilot must be sure that the aircraft is flyinghigh enough to clear thehighest terrain or obstruction along the intendedroute.It is especially important to have accurate altitude information when visibility is restricted.Toclear obstructions,the pilot must constantly be aware of the altitude of the aircraft and the elevation of the surrounding terrain.To reduce the possibility of a midair collision,itisessentialto maintain altitudein accordancewith airtrafficrules.  

# TypesofAltitude  

Altitude in itself is arelevantterm only when it is specifically stated to which type of altitude a pilot is referring. Normally when the term “altitude" is used, it is referring to altitude above sea level since this is the altitude which is used to depict obstacles and airspace, as well as to separate air traffic.  

Altitude is vertical distance above some point or level used as a reference. There are as many kinds of altitude as there are reference levels from which altitude is measured, and each maybe used for specific reasons.Pilots aremainly concerned withfivetypesofaltitudes:  

1. Indicated altitude-read directlyfrom the altimeter (uncorrected)when it is set to the current altimeter setting.  

2.True altitudethe vertical distance of the aircraft abovesealevel—the actualaltitude.It isoften expressedasfeet above mean sea level(MSL).Airport, terrain,and obstacle elevations on aeronautical charts are true altitudes.  

3.Absolute altitude—the vertical distance of an aircraft above the terrain, or above ground level (AGL).  

4. Pressure altitude-the altitude indicated when the altimeter setting window (barometric scale) is adjustedto  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .Thisisthealtitudeabove the standard datum plane, which is a theoretical plane where air pressure(corrected to  $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  equals  $29.92\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Pressure altitude is used to compute density altitude,true altitude,true airspeed(TAS),andother performance data.  

5. Density altitude—pressure altitude corrected for variations from standard temperature. When conditions are standard,pressure altitude anddensity altitude are the same.If the temperature is above standard,the density altitude is higher thanpressure altitude.If the temperature is below standard,the density altitude is lower than pressure altitude. This is an important altitude because it is directly related to the aircraft'sperformance.  

A pilot must understand how the performance of the aircraft isdirectlyrelatedtothedensityoftheair.Thedensityof the air affects how much power a naturally aspirated engine produces, as well as how efficient the airfoils are. If there are fewer air molecules (lower pressure) to accelerate through the propeller, the acceleration to rotation speed is longer and thusproduces a longer takeoff roll,whichtranslates to a decrease in performance.  

As an example, consider an airport with a field elevation of 5,048 feet MSL where the standard temperature is  $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Under theseconditions,pressure altitude and density altitude arethesame—5,048feet.If the temperature changes to  $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ，the density altitude increases to 7,855feet.This means an aircraft would perform on takeoff as though the field elevation were7,855feet at standard temperature. Conversely,atemperatureof  $-25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  wouldresultin adensity altitudeof1,232feet.An aircraft would perform much better under these conditions.  

# InstrumentCheck  

Prior to each flight,a pilot should examine the altimeter for proper indications in order to verify its validity. To determine the condition of an altimeter,set the barometric scale to the current reported altimeter setting transmitted by the local airport traffic control tower, flight service station (FsS), or any other reliable source,suchasATIS,AWOS,orAsOS. The altimeter pointers should indicate the surveyed field elevation of the airport. If the indication is off more than 75 feet from the surveyed field elevation,the instrument should be referred to a certificated instrument repair station for recalibration.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI, which is sometimes called a vertical velocity indicator (VVI), indicates whether the aircraft is climbing, descending, or in levelflight. The rate of climb or descent is indicated in feet per minute (fpm). If properly calibrated, the VSIindicateszeroinlevelflight.[Figure8-5]  

# Principle of Operation  

Although theVSI operates solely from static pressure, it is a differential pressure instrument. It contains a diaphragm with connecting linkage and gearing to the indicator pointer inside an airtight case. The inside of the diaphragm is connected directly to the static line of the pitot-static system. The area outside the diaphragm, which is inside the instrument case, is also connected to the static line but through a restricted orifice(calibratedleak).  

Both the diaphragm and the case receive air from the static line at existing atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm receives unrestricted air,while the case receives the static pressure via themeteredleak.Whenthe aircraft is on the ground or in level flight, the pressures inside the diaphragm and the instrument case are equal,and the pointer is at the zero indication. When the aircraft climbs or descends,the pressure inside the diaphragm changes immediately, but due to the metering action of the restricted passage, the case pressure remains higher or lower for a short time, causing the diaphragm to contract orexpand.Thiscauses apressure differential that is indicated on the instrument needle as aclimbor descent. When the pressure differential stabilizes at a definite ratio, the needle indicates the rate of altitude change.

Figure8-5.Vertical speed indicator(VSI)  

TheVSI displays two different types ofinformation  

Trend information shows an immediate indication of an increase or decrease in the aircraft's rate of climb ordescent. Rateinformationshowsastabilizedrateofchangein altitude.  

The trend information is the direction of movement of the VSI needle. For example, if an aircraft is maintaining level flight and the pilot pulls back on the control yoke causing the nose of the aircraft to pitch up,the VS I needle moves upward to indicate a climb.If the pitch attitude is held constant, the needle stabilizes after a short period(6-9seconds)and indicates the rate of climb in hundreds of fpm. The time period from the initial change in the rate of climb,until the VSI displays an accurate indication of thenew rate,is called the lag. Rough control technique and turbulence can extend thelagperiod and causeerratic and unstable rate indications. Some aircraft are equipped with an instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVsI), which incorporates accelerometers tocompensatefor thelag inthe typicalVSl. [Figure8-6]  

# InstrumentCheck  

As part of a preflight check, proper operation of the VSI must be established.Make sure the VS I indicates a near zero readingprior toleaving the ramp area and again just before takeoff.If the VS I indicates anything other than zero,that indication can be referenced asthezeromark.Normally,ifthe needle is not exactly zero, it is only slightly above or below thezeroline.Aftertakeoff,the Vs I should trend upward to indicate a positive rate of climb and then,onceastabilized climb is established, a rate of climb can be referenced.

# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)  

The ASI is a sensitive,differential pressure gauge that measures and promptly indicates the difference between pitot (impact/dynamicpressure)and static pressure.Thesetwo pressures are equal when the aircraft is parked on the ground incalm air.Whentheaircraft moves through the air,the pressure on the pitot line becomes greater than the pressure in the static lines. This difference in pressure is registered by the airspeedpointer on theface of theinstrument,which is calibrated in miles per hour, knots (nautical miles per hour), orboth.[Figure8-7]  

The AS I is the one instrument that utilizes both the pit ot. as well as the static system.The AS I introduces the static pressure into the airspeed case while the pitot pressure (dynamic)is introduced into the diaphragm.Thedynamic pressure expands or contracts one side of the diaphragm whichis attached to an indicating system.The system drives themechanical linkage and the airspeed needle.  

Just as in altitudes, there are multiple types of airspeeds Pilots need to be very familiar with each type.  

Indicated airspeed(IAS)—the direct instrument reading obtained from the AS I,uncorrectedfor variationsin atmospheric density,installation error, or instrument error.Manufacturers use this airspeed as the basis for determining aircraft performance. Takeoff, landing, and stall speeds listed in the AFM/ POH are I AS and do not normally vary with altitude ortemperature.  

![](images/50ae7e3166496eb214fefde0af78eaa1bd71ddb4a845859fb0a60f7a676df9be.jpg)  
Figure8-7.Airspeed indicator(ASI)  

Calibrated airspeed(CAS)—IAScorrectedfor installation error and instrument error.Although manufacturers attempt to keep airspeed errors to a minimum,it is notpossible to eliminate all errors throughout the airspeed operating range. At certain airspeeds and with certain flap settings,theinstallation and instrument errors may total several knots. This error is generally greatest atlowairspeeds.Inthe cruising and higher airspeed ranges, IAS and CAS are approximately the same.Refer to the airspeed calibration chart to correctfor possible airspeed errors.  

True airspeed(TAS)—CAS corrected for altitude and nonstandard temperature.Because air density decreases with an increase in altitude,anaircrafthas to be flown faster at higher altitudes to cause the same pressure difference between pitot impact pressure and static pressure.Therefore,foragivenCAs,TAS increases as altitude increases; or for a given TAS, CAS decreases as altitude increases.A pilot can find TAS by two methods. The most accurate method is to use a flight computer. With this method, the CAS is corrected for temperature and pressure variation by using the airspeed correction scale on the computer. Extremely accurate electronic flight computers are also available. Just enter the CAS, pressure altitude, and temperature,and the computer calculates the TAS. A second method,which is a rule of thumb,provides the approximate TAs.Simply add 2 percent to the CASforeach1,OoOfeetofaltitude.TheTASisthe speed that is used for flight planning and is used when filing aflightplan Groundspeed (GS)—the actual speed of the airplane over theground.It is T AS adjusted for wind.GS decreases with a headwind and increases with a toilnind  

# Airspeed Indicator Markings  

Aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or less, manufactured after 1945, and certificated by the FAA are required tohave ASIs marked in accordance with a standard color-coded marking system. This system of color-coded markings enables a pilot todetermine at a glance certain airspeed limitations that are important to the safe operation of the aircraft. For example, if during the execution of a maneuver,it is noted that the airspeed needle is in the yellow arc and rapidly approaching the red line,the immediate reaction should be to reduce airspeed.  

As shown in Figure 8-8,ASIsonsingle-engine small aircraft include the following standard color-codedmarkings:  

White arc commonly referred to as the flap operating range since its lower limit represents the full flaps tall speed and its upper limit provides the maximum flap  

![](images/a729f5a5cc6af087f95d2d3f520d2a75bc40d7421f742072e67008c8ca98f8ab.jpg)  
Figure8-8.Single engine airspeed indicator(ASI)  

speed.Approaches andlandings areusuallyflown at speeds within thewhite arc. Lower limit of white arc   $(\mathrm{V_{S0}})$  —the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.In small aircraft, this is the power-off stallspeedat the maximum landing weight in the landing configuration (gear and flaps down). Upper limit of the white arc  $\mathrm{(V_{FE})}$  —the maximum speed with the flaps extended. Green arc-the normal operating range of the aircraft. Most flying occurs within this range. Lower limit of green arc  $(\mathrm{V_{S1}})$  —the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed obtained in a specified configuration.Formostaircraft,thisisthe power-off stall speed at the maximum takeoff weight in the clean configuration (gear up, if retractable, and flaps up). Upper limit of green arc  $\mathrm{(V_{N0})}$  —the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air. Yellow arc—-caution range. Fly within this range only in smooth air and then only with caution. Red line   $(\mathrm{V_{NE}})$  —never exceed speed. Operating above this speed is prohibited since it may result in damage or structural failure.  

# Other Airspeed Limitations  

Some important airspeed limitations are not marked on the face of theASI,but arefound on placards and in the AFM/ POH.These airspeed s include:  

Design maneuvering speed  $(\mathrm{V_{A})}$  themaximum speed at which the structural design's limit load can be imposed (either by gusts or full deflection of the control surfaces) without causing structural damage. It is important to consider weight when referencing this speed. For example,  $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  may be 100 knots when an airplane is heavily loaded, but only 90knots when the load is light. Landing gear operating speed  $\mathrm{(V_{LO})}$  the maximum speed for extending or retracting the landing gear if flying an aircraft with retractable landing gear. Landing gear extended speed  $(\mathrm{V_{LE}})$  —the maximum speed at which an aircraft can be safely flown with the landing gear extended. Best angle-of-climb speed  $\left(\mathrm{V_{X}}\right)$  —theairspeedat which an aircraft gains the greatest amount of altitude in a given distance. It is used during a short-field takeoff to clear an obstacle. Best rate-of-climb speed  $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  —the airspeed that provides the most altitude gain in a given period of time Single-engine best rate-of-climb  $\mathrm{(V_{YSE})}$  —thebest rate-of-climb orminimum rate-of-sinkin alight twin-engine aircraft with one engine inoperative. It is marked on the ASI with a blue line.  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  is commonly referred to as "Blue Line." Minimum control speed   $(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{MC}})$  the minimum flight speed at which a light, twin-engine aircraft can be satisfactorily controlled when an engine suddenly becomes inoperative and the remaining engine is at takeoff power.  

# InstrumentCheck  

Priorto takeoff,theASI should read zero.However,if there is a strongwind blowing directlyinto the pitot tube,theASI may readhigher than zero.When beginning the takeoff make sure the airspeed is increasing at an appropriate rate.  

# BlockageofthePitot-StaticSystem  

Errorsalmostalwaysindicateblockageofthepitottube,the static port(s), or both.Blockage may be caused by moisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects.During preflight, make surethepitot tubecoveris removed.Then,checkthepitot and staticport openings.A blocked pitot tube affects the accuracy of the ASI, but a blockage of the static port not only affects theASI,but also causes errors in the altimeter and VS I.  

# Blocked Pit ot System  

Thepitotsystem can become blocked completely or only partiallyif the pit ot tube drain hole remains open.If thepitot tube becomes blocked and its associated drain hole remains clear, ram air is no longer able to enter the pitot system. Air already in the system vents through the drain hole,andthe remaining pressure drops to ambient(outside)airpressure. Under these circumstances, the ASI reading decreases to zero because the AS I senses no difference between ram and static air pressure.The A SIno longer operates since dynamic pressure cannot enter the pitot tube opening. Static pressure isabletoequalizeonbothsidessincethepitotdrainhole is still open. The apparent loss of airspeed is not usually instantaneous but happens very quickly.[Figure8-9]  

If both the pitot tube opening and the drain hole should become clogged simultaneously,then thepressurein thepitot tubeistrapped.No change is noted on the airspeed indication should the airspeed increase or decrease. If the static port is unblocked and the aircraft shouldchange altitude, then a change is noted on the ASI. The change is not related to a change in airspeed but a change in static pressure. The total pressure in the pitot tube does not change due to the blockage; however,the static pressure will change.  

Because airspeed indications rely upon both static and dynamic pressure together, the blockage of either of these systems affects the AS I reading.Remember that the AS I has a diaphragm in which dynamic air pressure is entered. Behind this diaphragm is a reference pressure called static pressure that comes from the static ports.The diaphragm pressurizes against this static pressure and as a result changes the airspeed indicationvialevers and indicators.[Figure8-10]  

For example,take an aircraft and slow it down to zero knots at a given altitude.If the static port (providing static pressure) and the pitot tube (providing dynamic pressure) are both unobstructed,the following claims can be made:  

1.The AS I would be zero. 2. Dynamic pressure and static pressure are equal. 3. Becauseboth dynamic and static airpressure areequal at zero speed with increased speed,dynamicpressure  

![](images/5650694b02251229c2e91a9498f2cb80a7bcc874c35ce973241864a55dc731ff.jpg)

Figure 8-10. Blocked pitot system with clear static system.  

must include two components: static pressure and dynamic pressure.  

It can be inferred that airspeed indication must be based upon a relationship between these two pressures, and indeed it is. A nASI uses the static pressure as a reference pressure and as aresult,theAsI's case is kept at this pressure behind the diaphragm. On the other hand, the dynamic pressure through thepitot tubeis connected to a highly sensitive diaphragm within the AS I case.Because an aircraft in zero motion (regardlessof altitude)results in a zero airspeed,thepitottube always provides static pressurein additionto dynamicpressure.  

Therefore, the airspeed indication is the result of two pressures:the pit ot tube static and dynamic pressure with ir thediaphragm as measured against the static pressure in the AsI'scase.  

diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an indication of decreased airspeed.Conversely,if the aircraft weretoclimb,the static pressure would decrease allowing the diaphragm toexpand, thereby showing anindication of greaterairspeed.[Figure8-10]  

Thepitot tube may become blocked during flight due to visible moisture. Some aircraft may be equipped with pitot heat for flight in visible moisture. Consult the AFM/POH for specific procedures regarding the use of pitot heat.  

# BlockedStaticSystem  

If the static system becomes blocked but the pit ot tube remainsclear,the AS I continues to operate;however,it is inaccurate. The airspeed indicates lower than the actual airspeed when the aircraft is operated above the altitude where the static ports became blocked because the trapped static pressure is higher than normal for that altitude.When operating at a lower altitude, a faster than actual airspeed is displayeddue to the relatively low static pressure trapped inthesystem.  

Revisiting the ratios thatwereused toexplain a blockedpitot tube, the same principle applies for a blocked static port. If the aircraft descends, the static pressure increases on the pitot side showing an increase on the ASI. This assumes that the aircraft does not actually increase its speed. The increase in static pressure on the pit ot side is equivalent to an increase in dynamic pressure since the pressure cannot change on thestaticside.  

If an aircraft begins to climb after a static port becomes blocked, the airspeed begins to show a decrease as the aircraft continues to climb. This is due to the decrease in static pressure on the pitot side, while the pressure on the staticsideisheldconstant.  

A blockage of the static system also affects the altimeter and VSI. Trapped static pressure causes the altimeter to freeze at the altitude where theblockage occurred.In the case of theVSI,a blockedstaticsystemproduces a continuouszero indication.[Figure8-11]  

Someaircraftareequippedwithanalternatestaticsourcein the flight deck. In the case of a blocked static source, opening the alternate static source introduces static pressure from the flight deck into the system.Flight deck static pressure is lower than outside static pressure.Check the aircraft AOM/POHfon airspeed corrections when utilizing alternate static pressure.  

If the aircraft were todescend while the pitot tube is obstructed, the pressure in the pitot system, including the diaphragm,would remain constant.But asthe descent is made, the static pressure would increase against the

# Electronic Flight Display (EFD)  

Advances in technology have brought about changes in the instrumentation found in all types of aircraft;forexample. Electronic Flight Displays (EFDs) commonly referred to as"glass cockpits."EF Ds include flight displays suchas primary flight displays (PFD) and multi-function displays (MFD). This has changed not only what information is available to a pilot, but alsohow the information is displayed. In addition to the improvement in system reliability, which increases overall safety,EF Ds have decreased the overall cost of equipping aircraft with state-of-the-art instrumentation. Primary electronic instrumentation packages arelessprone to failure than their analogue counterparts. No longer is it necessaryfor aircraftdesignerstocreateclutteredpanel layoutsinorder to accommodate all necessary flight instruments.Instead,multi-panel digital flight displays combine all flight instruments on to a single screen that is called a primary flight display (PFD). The traditional “six pack”of instruments is now displayed on one liquid crystal display(LCD)screen.  

# Airspeed Tape  

Configured similarly to traditional panel layouts, the ASI is located on the left side of the screen and is displayed as a vertical speed tape. As the aircraft increases in speed, the larger numbers descend from the top of the tape. The TAS is displayed at the bottom of the tape through the input to the air data computer (ADC) from the outside air temperature probe. Airspeed markings for  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  ,and rotation speed  $(\mathrm{V_{R})}$  are displayed for pilot reference. An additional pilot-controlled airspeed bug is availabletoset at any desired reference speed. As on traditional analogue ASIs, the electronic airspeed tape displays the color-coded ranges for the flap operating range  

![](images/9f6d8d592a3750d8db8b6a022ee4198ddbca18841e792b6bb60c1c377bfa63c2.jpg)

normal range, and caution range. [Figure8-12] The number value changes color to red when the airspeed exceeds  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  warn the pilot of exceeding the maximum speedlimitation.  

# Attitude Indicator  

One improvement over analogue instrumentation is the larger attitude indicator on EFD. The artificial horizon spans the entire width of thePFD.[Figure8-12]Thisexpanded instrumentation offers better reference through allphasesof flight and all flight maneuvers.The attitude indicator receives its information from the Attitude Heading and Reference System(AHRS).  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter is located on the right side of the PF D. [Figure8-12] As the altitude increases,thelarger numbers descend from the top of the display tape, with the current altitude being displayed in theblackboxin thecenterof the display tape. The altitude is displayed in increments of 20 feet.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSl)  

The Vs I is displayed totherightof the altimeter tape and can take theform of an arced indicator or avertical speed tape. [Figure8-12] Both are equipped with avertical speed bug  

# Heading Indicator  

Theheadingindicatorislocatedbelowthe artificialhorizon and is normally modeled after a Horizontal Situation Indicator(HSI).[Figure8-12]Asinthecaseof the attitude indicator,the heading indicator receives its information from themagnetometer,which feeds information to the A HRS unit and then out to the PF D.  

# Turn Indicator  

The turn indicator takes a slightly different form than the traditional instrumentation.Aslidingbar movesleft and right below the triangle to indicate deflection from coordinated flight.[Figure8-12]Reference for coordinated flight comes from accelerometerscontainedintheAHRSunit.  

# Tachometer  

The sixth instrument normally associated with the"six pack" package is the tachometer.This is the onlyinstrument that is not located on the PFD. The tachometer is normally located on the multi-function display (MFD). In the event of a display screenfailure,it is displayed on the remaining screen with the PF D flight instrumentation.[Figure8-13]  

# Slip/SkidIndicator  

Theslip/skid indicator is the horizontal line below theroll pointer.[Figure8-12]Like a ballin a turn-and-slipindicator a bar width off center is equal to one ball width displacement.  

# Turn Rate Indicator  

The turn rate indicator,illustrated in Figure 8-12,istypically found directly above the rotating compass card. Tick marks tothe left and right of the lubber line denote the turn (standardrate versus half standard-rate). Typically denoted by a trend line,if the trend vector is extended to the second tickmarkthe aircraft isin a standard-rate turn.  

Individual panel displays canbe configuredfor a variety of aircraft by installing different software packages. [Figure 8-14/ Manufacturers are also able to upgrade existing instrument displays in a similar manner, eliminating the need to replace individual gauges in order toupgrade.

Figure8-14.Chelton'sFlightLogic(top)andAvidyne'sEntegra (bottom)are examples of panel displays that are configurable  

# Air Data Computer (ADC)  

EFDs utilize the same type of instrument inputs as traditional analogue gauges; however, the processing system is different. The pitot static inputs are received by an ADC. The ADC computes the difference between the total pressure and the staticpressureandgeneratestheinformationnecessaryto display the airspeed onthePFD.Outside air temperatures are alsomonitored and introduced into various components within the system, as well as being displayed on the PFD screen.[Figure8-15]  

The ADC is a separate solid state device that, in addition to providing data to thePFD,is capable of providing data to the autopilot control system.In the event of system malfunction, the ADC can quickly be removed and replaced in order to decrease downtimeand decrease maintenance turn-aroundtimes.  

Altitude information is derived from the static pressure port just as an analogue system does;however, the static pressure

does not enter a diaphragm.The ADC computes the received barometric pressure and sends a digital signal to thePFD to display the proper altitudereadout.EFDs alsoshowtrend vectors,which show thepilot how the altitude and airspeed areprogressing.  

# Trend Vectors  

Trendvectors aremagentalines that move up and down both the AS I and the altimeter.[Figures8-16and8-17]TheADC computes therateofchange and displays the6-second projection of where the aircraft will be.Pilots can utilize the trend vectors tobetter controlthe aircraft's attitude.By including the trend vectors in the instrumentscan,pilots are abletoprecisely control airspeed and altitude.Additional information can be obtained by referencing the Instrument Flying Handbook or specific avionics manufacturer's training material

# Gyroscopic Flight Instruments  

Several flight instruments utilize theproperties of agyroscope for their operation. The most common instruments containing gyroscopes are the turn coordinator, heading indicator, and the attitude indicator.To understand how these instruments operate requires knowledge of the instrument power systems, gyroscopic principles, and the operating principles of each instrument.  

# Gyroscopic Principles  

Any spinning object exhibits gyroscopic properties.Awheel orrotor designed and mounted toutilize theseproperties is called a gyroscope. Two important design characteristics of an instrument gyro are great weight for its size, or high density,and rotation at high speed with low friction bearings.  

There are two general types of mountings; the type used depends upon which property of the gyro is utilized. A freely or universally mounted gyroscope is free to rotate in any direction about its center of gravity. Such a wheel is said to havethreeplanesoffreedom.Thewheelorrotorisfreeto rotate in any plane in relation to the base and is balanced so that, with the gyro wheel at rest, it remains in the position in which it is placed. Restricted or semi-rigidly mounted gyroscopes are those mounted so that one of the planes of freedomisheldfixedinrelationtothebase.  

There are two fundamental properties of gyroscopic action rigidityinspace andprecession.  

# Rigidity in Space  

Rigidity in space refers to the principle that a gyroscope remains in a fixed position in the plane in which it is spinning An example of rigidity in space is that of a bicycle wheel. As the bicycle wheels increase speed,they become more stable in their plane of rotation. This is why a bicycle is unstable and maneuverableatlowspeedsandstableandlessmaneuverable athigherspeeds.  

By mounting this wheel, or gyroscope, on a set of gimbal rings, the gyro is able to rotate freely in any direction. Thus, if the gimbal rings are tilted,twisted,or otherwise moved, the gyro remains in the plane in which it was originally spinning.[Figure8-18]  

# Precession  

Precession is the tilting or turning of agyroinresponse to a deflective force. The reaction to this force does not occur at the point at which it was applied; rather, it occurs at a point that is  $90^{\circ}$  later in the direction of rotation. This principle allows the gyro to determine arate of turnbysensing the amount of pressure createdby a changein direction.The rate at which the gyro p recesses is inversely proportional to the speed of the rotor and proportional to the deflect ive force.  

Using the example of the bicycle,precession acts on the wheels in order to allow the bicycle to turn. While riding at normal speed, it is not necessary to turn the handle bars in the direction of the desired turn. A rider simply leans in the direction that he or she wishes to go.Since the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction when viewed from the rightsideof thebicycle,if a riderleans totheleft,aforceis applied tothetopof thewheel to theleft.Theforce actually acts  $90^{\circ}$  inthedirection of rotation,whichhas theeffect of applying a force to the front of the tire,causing the bicycle  

![](images/28deb6964299e88643a907532cfb7d5407b4f6f254604dc0334bd8b913025b4a.jpg)  
Figure8-18.Regardlessof the position of its base,agyrotends to remain rigid in space,with its axis of rotation pointed in a constant direction.  

to move to the left. There is a need to turn the handlebars at low speeds because of the instability of the slowly turning gyros and also to increase the rate of turn.  

Precession can also create some minor errors in some instruments.[Figure8-19]Precession can cause a freely spinning gyro to become displaced from its intended plane of rotation through bearingfriction,etc.Certain instruments may require corrective realignment during flight, such as the heading indicator.  

# Sources of Power  

In some aircraft, all the gyros are vacuum, pressure, or electrically operated. In other aircraft, vacuum or pressure systems provide the power for the heading and attitude indicators,while the electrical system provides the power for the turn coordinator. Most aircraft have at least two sources of power to ensure atleast one source of bank information is available if one power source fails.The vacuum or pressure system spins thegyroby drawing astream of air against the rotor vanes to spin the rotor athighspeed,muchlikethe operation of awaterwheel or turbine.The amount ofvacuum or pressure required for instrument operation varies,butis usuallybetween  $4.5\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  and  $5.5\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  

One source of vacuum for the gyros is a vane-type engine driven pump that is mounted on the accessory case of the engine. Pump capacity varies in different aircraft, depending on thenumber ofgyros.  

A typical vacuum system consists of an engine-driven vacuum pump, relief valve, air filter, gauge, and tubing necessary to complete the connections.Thegaugeis mounted intheaircraft's instrument panel and indicates the amount  

![](images/2406a15d35a15ad71b8ed62a6d9d7fbb38e995a56031ee384ff39601277f7317.jpg)  
Figure 8-19.Precession of a gyroscope resulting from an applied deflectiveforce.  

of pressure in the system (vacuum is measured in inches of mercury less than ambient pressure).  

As shown in Figure 8-20,air is drawn into the vacuum system by the engine-driven vacuum pump. It first goes through afilter,which prevents foreign matter from entering the vacuum or pressure system. The air then moves through the attitude and heading indicators where it causes the gyros to spin.A relief valve prevents the vacuum pressure, or suction, from exceeding prescribed limits. After that, the air is expelled overboard or used in other systems,suchasfor inflating pneumatic deicing boots.  

It is important to monitor vacuum pressure during flight. because the attitude and heading indicators may not provide reliable information when suction pressure is low. The vacuum, or suction, gauge is generally marked to indicate the normal range. Some aircraft are equipped with a warning lightthat illuminateswhen the vacuum pressure dropsbelow the acceptable level.  

When the vacuum pressure drops below the normal operating range, the gyroscopic instruments may become unstable and inaccurate.Cross-checking the instruments routinely is a good habit to develop  

# Turn Indicators  

Aircraft use two types of turn indicators:turn-and-slip indicators and turn coordinators.Because of the way the gyro is mounted,theturn-and-slip indicator shows onlytherate of turn in degrees per second.Theturn coordinator is mounted atanangle,orcanted,soitcaninitiallyshowroll rate.When the roll stabilizes,it indicates rate of turn.Bothinstruments indicate turn direction and quality (coordination), and also serve as a backup source of bank informationin the event an attitude indicator fails. Coordination is achieved by referring to the in cli no meter,which consists of a liquid-filledcurved tube with a ball inside.[Figure8-21]  

# Turn-and-SlipIndicator  

The gyro in the turn-and-slip indicator rotates in the vertical plane corresponding to the aircraft's longitudinal axis. A single gimbal limits the planes in which the gyro can tilt, and a spring works to maintain a center position.Because of precession, a yawing force causes the gyro to tilt left or right, as viewed from the pilot seat.Theturn-and-slipindicaton uses a pointer, called the turn needle, to show the direction and rate of turn. The turn-and-slip indicator is incapable of “tumbling” off its rotational axis because of the restraining springs.When extreme forces areapplied toagyro,thegyro is displaced from its normal plane of rotation, rendering its indications invalid.Certain instruments have specificpitch and bank limits that induce a tumble of the gyro.  

![](images/515eb094cd8f5617cc41248b1ae8c12b0c0ba0f81842c06b193c074e426aee8c.jpg)  
Figure8-20.Typical vacuum system  

# Turn Coordinator  

The gimbal in the turn coordinator is canted; therefore, its gyro can sense both rate of roll and rate of turn.Since turn coordinators are more prevalent in training aircraft, this discussion concentrates on that instrument.Whenrollinginto oroutofaturn,the miniature aircraft banks in the direction the aircraft is rolled.A rapid roll rate causes the miniature aircrafttobankmoresteeplythanaslowrollrate.  

aircraft with the turn index.Figure8-22shows apictureof a turncoordinator.There are two marks on each side(left and right)ofthefaceof theinstrument.The first mark is used to reference a wings level zero rate of turn. The second mark on the left and right side of the instrument serve to indicate a standard rate of turn.Astandard-rate turn is defined as a turnrateof  $3^{\circ}$  per second. The turn coordinator indicates only the rate and direction of turn; it does not display a specific angleofbank.  

The turn coordinator can be used to establish andmaintain a standard-rate turn by aligning the wing of the miniature

# Inclinometer  

The inclinometer is used to depict aircraft yaw, which is the side-to-side movement of the aircraft's nose.During coordinated,straight-and-level flight,theforce ofgravity causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the tube,centered between the reference lines.Coordinated flight is maintained by keeping the ball centered.If the ball is not centered,itcan be centered by using the rudder.  

To center the ball,apply rudder pressure on the side to which the ball is deflected.Use the simple rule,“steponthe ball,"to remember which rudder pedal to press.Ifaileron and rudder are coordinated during a turn,theball remains centeredinthetube.If aerodynamicforces areunbalanced, the ball moves away from the center of the tube.Asshown in Figure 8-22, in a slip, the rate of turn is too slow for the angleofbank,and theball moves totheinsideof theturn.In a skid, the rate of turn is too great for the angle of bank, and the ball moves to the outside of the turn.To correct for these conditions,and improve the quality of the turn,rememberto 'stepontheball."Varying the angle of bank can also help restore coordinated flight from a slip or skid.Tocorrectfora slip,decreasebankand/or increase the rate of turn.Tocorrect foraskid,increase the bank and/or decrease the rate of turn.  

# Yaw String  

to the center of the wind screen.When in coordinated flight, the string trails straight back over the top of the windscreen. When the aircraft is either slipping or skidding, the yaw string moves to the right or left depending on the direction ofsliporskid.  

# InstrumentCheck  

During preflight, ensure that the inclinometer is full of fluid and has no air bubbles. The ball should also be resting at its lowest point. When taxiing, the turn coordinator should indicate a turnin the correct direction while the ball moves opposite the direction of theturn.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator, with its miniature aircraft and horizon bar,displays a picture of the attitude of the aircraft.The relationship of the miniature aircraft to the horizon bar is thesame as the relationship of thereal aircrafttothe actual horizon. The instrument gives aninstantaneous indication of even the smallest changes in attitude.  

The gyroin the attitude indicator is mounted in a horizontal plane and depends upon rigidity in space for its operation. The horizon bar represents the true horizon. This bar is fixed to the gyro and remains in a horizontal plane as the aircraft is pitched or banked about its lateral or longitudinal axis,indicating the attitude of the aircraft relative to the true horizon.[Figure8-23]  

The gyro spins in the horizontal plane and resists deflection of the rotational path. Since the gyro relies on rigidity in space, the aircraft actually rotates around the spinning gyro.  

![](images/2f3597c93dd0d7dc0c082230f46ef52a6f588697760f4f79149fc91c8726f3a6.jpg)

One additional tool thatcanbe added tothe aircraftis ayaw string. A yaw string is simply a string or piece of yarn attachec An adjustment knob is provided with which the pilot may movetheminiatureaircraftupordowntoaligntheminiature aircraft with the horizon bar to suit the pilot'slineofvision. Normally,the miniature aircraft is adjusted so that the wings overlap the horizon bar when the aircraft is in straight-and- level cruisingflight.  

The pitch and bank limits depend upon the make and model of the instrument. Limits in the banking plane are usually from  $100^{\circ}$  to  $110^{\circ}$  , and the pitch limits are usually from  $60^{\circ}$  to  $70^{\circ}$  .Ifeitherlimitisexceeded,theinstrumentwilltumble or spill and will give incorrect indications until realigned.A number of modern attitude indicators do not tumble.  

Everypilot should be able tointerpret the banking scale illustrated in Figure 8-24.Most banking scale indicators on the top of the instrument move in the same direction from that in which the aircraft is actually banked. Some other models move in the opposite direction from that in which the aircraft is actually banked. This may confuse the pilot if the indicator is used to determine the direction of bank.This scale should be used only tocontrol the degree of desired bank.The relationship of the miniature aircraft to the horizon bar should be used for an indication of the direction of bank. The attitude indicator is reliable and the most realistic flight instrument on the instrument panel. Its indications are very close approximations of the actual attitude of the aircraft.  

# Heading Indicator  

The heading indicator is fundamentally a mechanical instrument designed tofacilitate the use of the magnetic compass.Errorsin themagnetic compass arenumerous,  

![](images/0d1e37fc848bdc53886edc75674e284aa53bbf10227ffa7b71e6d2b021d41799.jpg)  
Figure8-24.Attitude representation by the attitude indicator corresponds to the relation of the aircraft to the real horizon.  

making straightflight and precision turns to headings difficult to accomplish, particularly in turbulent air. A heading indicator,however,is not affected by the forces that make the magnetic compass difficult to interpret.[Figure8-25]  

The operation of the heading indicator depends upon the principle of rigidity in space. The rotor turns in a vertical plane and fixed to the rotor is a compasscard.Sincetherotor remains rigid in space, the points on the card hold the same position in space relative to the vertical plane of the gyro.The aircraft actually rotates around the rotating gyro, not the other way around.As the instrument case and the aircraft revolve around the vertical axis of the gyro,the card provides clear and accurate heading information.  

Because of precession caused by friction,theheading indicator creeps or drifts from its set position. Among other factors, the amount of drift depends largely upon the condition of the instrument. If the bearings are worn, dirty, or improperly lubricated,the drift maybe excessive.Another errorin the heading indicator iscausedby thefactthatthe gyro is oriented in space, and the Earth rotates in space at a rateof  $15^{\circ}$  in 1 hour. Thus, discounting precession caused by friction, the heading indicator may indicate as much as  $15^{\circ}$  errorper everyhourof operation.  

Some heading indicators referred to as horizontal situation indicators(HSI)receive a magnetic north reference from a magnetic slaving transmitter and generally need no adjustment. The magnetic slaving transmitter is called amagnetometer.  

![](images/4a26580b29cfd1df9087d7549aa0c4d0f1e61e2699c30bff3ebd770ef2744af8.jpg)

# Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)  

Electronic flight displays have replaced free-spinning gyros withsolid-statelaser systems that are capable of flight at any attitudewithout tumbling.This capability is theresult of the development of the Attitude and Heading Reference System(AHRS).  

The A HRS sends attitude information to the PF D in order to generate the pitch and bank information of the attitude indicator. The heading information is derived from a magnetometer that senses the earth's lines of magnetic flux. This information is then processed and sent out to the PFD togenerate theheading display.[Figure8-26]  

# The Flux Gate Compass System  

As mentioned earlier, the lines of flux in the Earth's magnetic field have two basic characteristics: a magnet aligns with them, and an electrical current is induced, or generated, in any wire crossed by them.  

The flux gate compass that drives slaved gyros uses the characteristic of current induction.The flux valve is a small, segmentedring,like the one in Figure 8-27,madeofsoftiron that readily accepts lines of magnetic flux. An electrical coil is wound around each of the three legs to accept the current induced in this ring by the Earth's magnetic field. A coil wound around the iron spacer in the center of theframe has  $400\:\mathrm{Hz}$  alternating current (AC) flowing through it. During the times when this current reaches its peak, twice during each cycle, there is so much magnetism produced by this coil that theframe cannot accept thelines of fluxfrom the Earth'sfield.  

![](images/1340ad106e433cb4e2de2df48454a417830416b6896d181636adef53b12cf652.jpg)

Figure8-27.The soft iron frame of the flux valve accepts the flux from theEarth's magnetic field each time the current in the center coil reverses.This flux causes current to flow in the three pickup coils  

As the current reverses between the peaks,itdemagnetizes theframesoitcanacceptthefluxfrom theEarth'sfield.As thisfluxcuts across the windings in the three coils,itcauses currenttoflowin them.These three coils are connected in such away that the current flowing in them changes as the headingof theaircraft changes.[Figure8-28]  

The three coilsare connected to three similarbut smaller coils in a synchro inside the instrument case.The synchro rotates the dial of a radio magnetic indicator (RMI) or a HSI

Figure8-28.The current in each of the three pickup coils changes with the heading of the aircraft  

# Remote Indicating Compass  

Remote indicating compasses were developed to compensate for the errors and limitations of the older type of heading indicators.Thetwopanel-mounted components of atypical system are the pictorial navigation indicator and the slaving controlandcompensatorunit.[Figure8-29]Thepictorial navigation indicator is commonly referred to as anHSI.  

The slaving control and compensator unit has a push button that provides a means of selecting either the “slaved gyro" or “free gyro" mode. This unit also has a slaving meter and two manual heading-drive buttons. The slaving meter indicates the difference between the displayed heading and the magnetic heading. A right deflection indicates a clockwise error of the compass card; a left deflection indicates a counterclockwise error.Whenever the aircraft is in a turn and the card rotates, the slaving meter shows a full deflection to one side or the other. When the system is in “free gyro" mode, the compass card may be adjusted by depressing the appropriate heading-drivebutton.  

Aseparateunit,the magnetic slaving transmitter,is mounted remotely,usually in a wingtip to eliminate the possibility of magnetic interference.It contains the flux valve,whichis the direction-sensing device of thesystem.A concentration of lines of magneticforce,after beingamplified,becomes  

![](images/eb588e6704d8072023f967a0037f77948820b9550bfc863aaedaffce61b08f79.jpg)  
Figure8-29.Pictorial navigation indicator(HSI,top),slavingmeter (lowerright),and slaving control com pens at or unit(lowerleft)  

a signal relayed to theheading indicator unit, which is also remotely mounted. This signal operates a torque motor in the heading indicator unit that processes the gyro unit until it is aligned with the transmitter signal. The magnetic slaving transmitter is connected electrically to the HSI.  

There are a number of designs of the remote indicating compass;therefore,only the basic features of the system are covered here. Instrument pilots must become familiar with the characteristics of the equipment in their aircraft.  

As instrument panels become more crowded and the pilot's available s can time is reduced by aheavierflight deck workload,instrument manufacturers have worked toward combininginstruments.Onegoodexampleofthisisthe RMI in Figure 8-30. The compass card is driven by signals from the flux valve, and the two pointers are driven by an automatic directionfinder (ADF) and a very high frequency (VHF)omni-directional radio range (VOR).  

Heading indicators that do not have this automatic northseeking capability are called “free” gyros and require periodic adjustment. It is important to check theindications frequently (approximately every 15 minutes) and reset the heading indicator to align it with the magnetic compass whenrequired.Adjust the heading indicator to the magnetic compass heading when the aircraft is straight and level at a constant speed to avoid compass errors.  

The bank and pitch limits of the heading indicator vary with theparticular design and make ofinstrument.Onsome heading indicators found inlight aircraft,thelimits are approximately  $55^{\circ}$  ofpitch and  $55^{\circ}$  of bank.Wheneither of these attitude limits is exceeded, the instrument “tumbles"  

![](images/e1a753c30f200f376bf39e202c566bb236443fced87e44a7dff8f3f3bb39842b.jpg)  
Figure8-3o.Driven by signals from a flux valve,thecompasscard in this RMI indicates the heading of the aircraft opposite the upper centerindexmark.The green pointer is driven by the ADF.  

or“spills"and no longer gives the correct indication until reset.After spilling,it maybe reset with the cagingknob. Many of the modern instruments used are designed in such a manner so that they do not tumble  

An additional precession error may occur due to a gyro not spinning fast enough to maintain its alignment. When the vacuum system stops producing adequate suction to maintain the gyro speed, the heading indicator and the attitude indicator gyros begin to slow down. As they slow, they become more susceptible to deflection from the plane of rotation. Some aircraft have warninglights to indicate that a lowvacuum situation has occurred.Other aircraft may have only a vacuum gauge that indicates the suction.  

# InstrumentCheck  

As thegyrospoolsup,make sure there areno abnormal sounds.Whiletaxiing,the instrument should indicate turns in the correct direction,and precession should be normal.Atidle powersettings,the gyroscopic instruments using the vacuum system might not be up to operating speeds and precession might occur more rapidly than duringflight  

# Angle of Attack Indicators  

Thepurposeof anAOA indicator is to give thepilotbetter situational awareness pertaining to the aerodynamic health oftheairfoil.This can also be referred to as stall margin awareness.More simply explained,itis the margin that exists between the current AOA that the airfoil is operating at, and the AO A at which the airfoil will stall(criticalAOA).  

Speed by itself is not a reliable parameter to avoid as tall. An airplanecanstall atanyspeed.Angleof attackis abetter parameter to use to avoid a stall. For a given configuration, theairplane alwaysstallsatthesameAOA,referred toas thecriticalAOA.This critical AO A does not change with:  

Weight Bank Angle Temperature Density Altitude Center of Gravity  

A nAO A indicator can have several benefits when installed in General Aviation aircraft,not the least of which is increased situational awareness.Without a nAO A indicator,theAOA is“invisible'topilots.Thesedevicesmeasureseveral parameters simultaneously and determine the currentAOA providing a visual image to the pilot of thecurrentAOA along with representations of the proximity to the critical AOA. [Figure8-31]These devices can give a visual representation of the energy management state of the airplane. The energy

state of an airplane is thebalance between airspeed, altitude drag, and thrust and represents how efficiently the airfoil is operating.  

# Compass Systems  

The Earth is a huge magnet, spinning in space, surrounded by a magnetic field made up of invisiblelines of flux. These lines leave the surface at the magnetic North Pole and reenter at the magnetic South Pole.  

Lines of magnetic flux have twoimportant characteristics: anymagnet that is free to rotate will alignwith them,and an electrical current is induced into any conductor that cuts across them. Most direction indicators installed in aircraft makeuseofoneofthesetwocharacteristics.  

# Magnetic Compass  

One of the oldest and simplest instruments for indicating direction is the magnetic compass. It is also one of the basic instruments required by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations(14 CFR)part 91 for bothVFR and IFR flight  

A magnet is a piece of material, usually a metal containing iron, that attracts and holds lines of magnetic flux. Regardless of size, every magnet has two poles: north and south. When one magnet is placed in the field of another, the unlike poles attract each other,and like poles repel  

Anaircraftmagneticcompass,suchastheoneinFigure8-32 has two small magnets attached to a metal float sealed inside a bowl of clear compass fluid similar tokerosene.A graduated scale,called a card,iswrapped around thefloat andviewed through a glass window with a lubber line across it. The card is marked with letters representing the cardinal directions, north,east,south,andwest,and a number for each  $30^{\circ}$  between these letters. The final  $"0"$  is omitted from these directions. For example,  $3=30^{\circ}$   $6=60^{\circ}$  ,and  $33=330^{\circ}$  There arelong and short graduation marks between the letters and numbers,eachlong mark representing  $10^{\circ}$  andeachshort mark representing  $5^{\circ}$  

The float and card assembly has a hardened steel pivot in its center that rides inside a special, spring-loaded, hard glass jewel cup.The buoyancy of thefloat takes most of the weight offofthepivot,and the fluid damps the oscillation of the float and card. This jewel-and-pivot type mounting allows the float freedom to rotate and tilt up to approximately  $18^{\circ}$  angle of bank. At steeper bank angles, the compass indications are erratic and unpredictable.  

The compasshousing isentirelyfull of compass fluid.To prevent damage or leakagewhen thefluid expandsand contracts with temperature changes, the rear of the compass case is sealedwith a flexible diaphragm,or with ametal bellows in some compasses.  

The magnets align with the Earth's magnetic field and the pilot reads the direction on the scale opposite the lubber line. Note that in Figure 8-32, the pilot views the compass  

![](images/44c84f1c4fda95239cc817ca06e951c42bf61aca59c5ee2cab542f9d0c76be99.jpg)

card from its backside. When the pilot is flying north, as the compassindicates,eastistothepilot'sright.Onthecard，“33,"whichrepresents  $330^{\circ}$  (west of north),is to the right of north. The reason for this apparent backward graduation is that the card remains stationary, and the compass housing and the pilot rotate around it.Because of this setup,themagnetic compass can be confusing to read.  

# Magnetic CompassInduced Errors  

The magnetic compass is the simplest instrument in the panel, but it is subject to a number of errors that must beconsidered.  

Variation  

The Earth rotates about its geographic axis; maps and charts are drawn using meridians of longitude that pass through the geographic poles.Directions measured from the geographic poles arecalled true directions.The magnetic North Pole to which the magnetic compass points is not collocated with the geographic North Pole,butissome1,300milesaway; directions measured from the magnetic poles are called magnetic directions.In aerial navigation,the difference between true and magnetic directions is called variation.This same angular difference in surveying and land navigation is called declination.  

Figure8-33 shows the is og onic lines that identify the num ben of degrees ofvariationin theirarea.Theline thatpassesnear Chicago is called the agonic line. Anywhere along this line the two poles are aligned, and there is no variation. East ofthisline,themagneticNorthPoleistothewestofthe geographic North Pole and a correction must be applied to a compass indication to get a true direction.  

Flying in the Washington, D.C., area, for example, the variationis  $10^{\circ}$  west.If a pilot wants to fly a true course of south  $(180^{\circ})$  , the variation must be added to this, resulting in a magnetic course of  $190^{\circ}$  to fly.Flying in the Los Angeles California area, the variation is  $14^{\circ}$  east.To fly a true course of  $180^{\circ}$  there, the pilot would have to subtract the variation and fly a magnetic course of  $166^{\circ}$  .The variation error does notchangewiththeheadingoftheaircraft;itisthesame anywhere along theisogonicline.  

Deviation  

The magnets in a compass align with any magnetic field Some causes for magnetic fields in aircraft include flowing electrical current, magnetized parts, and conflict with the Earth'smagneticfield.Theseaircraft magnetic fields create a compass error called deviation.  

Deviation,unlikevariation,depends on the aircraft heading Also unlike variation,theaircraft's geographic location does not affect deviation.While noone can reduce or change variation error,an aviation maintenance technician (AMT)can provide the means to minimize deviation error by performing the maintenance task known as “swinging thecompass."  

![](images/043893a6eb2042576b428dfe3add22a302adba97745d0fe0ab600acf3bb289ca.jpg)  
Figure8-33.Is og onic lines are lines of equal variation  

To swing the compass,an AMT positions the aircraft on a series of known headings, usually at a compass rose.[Figure8-34]Acompassroseconsistsofaseries of linesmarked every  $30^{\circ}$   on an airport ramp, oriented to magneticnorth.There is minimal magnetic interference at the compass rose. The pilot or the AMT, if authorized, can taxi the aircraft to the compass rose and maneuver the aircraft to the headings prescribed by the AMT.  

As the aircraft is“swung”or aligned to each compass rose heading, the AMT adjusts the compensator assembly located on the top or bottom of the compass.The compensator assembly has two shafts whose ends have screwdrivers lots accessiblefrom thefront of the compass.Eachshaft rotates one or two small compensating magnets. The end of one shaft is marked E-W, and its magnets affect the compass when the aircraft is pointed east or west.The other shaft is marked N-S and its magnets affect the compass when the aircraft is pointed north or south.  

The adjustments position the compensating magnets to minimize the difference between the compass indication and the actual aircraft magnetic heading. The AMT records any remaining error on a compass correction card like the one in Figure 8-35 and places it in a holder near the compass. OnlyAMTs can adjust the compass or complete the compass correction card. Pilots determine and fly compass headings using the deviation errors noted on the card. Pilots must also note the use of any equipment causing operational magnetic interference such as radios, deicing equipment, pitot heat, radar,ormagneticcargo  

The correctionsfor variation and deviationmust be applied inthe correctsequence as shownbelow,startingfrom the true course desired.

Step2:DeterminetheCompassCourse MagneticCourse(  $190^{\circ}$  ,from step 1)  $\pm$  Deviation  $(-2^{\circ}$  ,from correction card)  $=$  Compass Course  $(188^{\circ})$  

NOTE:Intermediate magnetic courses between thoselisted on the compass card need to be interpreted. Therefore, to steer a true course of  $180^{\circ}$  ,the pilot would follow a compass courseof  $188^{\circ}$  

To find the true course that is being flown when the compass course is known:  $\pm$   $=$  Magnetic Course ± Variation  $\leftrightharpoons$  True Course  

# DipErrors  

The Earth's magnetic field runs parallel to its surface only at the Magnetic Equator, which is the point halfway between the Magnetic North and South Poles.As you move away from the Magnetic Equator towards the magnetic poles, the anglecreated bythevertical pull oftheEarth'smagneticfield in relation to the Earth's surface increases gradually. This angle is known as the dip angle. The dip angle increases in a downward direction as you move towards the Magnetic North Pole and increases in an upward direction as you move towards the Magnetic South Pole.  

If the compass needle were mounted sothat it could pivot freely in three dimensions,it would align itself with the magnetic field, pointing up or down at the dip angle in the direction of local Magnetic North. Because the dip angle is of no navigational interest,the compass is made so that it can rotate only in the horizontal plane.Thisis donebylowering the center of gravity below the pivot point and making the assemblyheavy enoughthat thevertical component of the magnetic force is too weak to tilt it significantly out of the horizontal plane.The compass can thenwork effectively at all latitudes without specific compensationfor dip. However, close tothe magnetic poles,the horizontal component of theEarth'sfield is toosmall to align thecompass which makes the compass unuseable for navigation.Because of thisconstraint,the compass only indicates correctly if the card is horizontal.Once tilted out of the horizontal plane, it will be affected by the vertical component of the Earth's field which leads to the following discussions on northerly and southerly turning errors.  

# Northerly Turning Errors  

The center of gravity of thefloat assembly is locatedlower than the pivotal point. As the aircraft turns, the force that resultsfrom themagnetic dip causes thefloat assemblyto swingin thesame direction that the float turns.Theresultis a false northerly turn indication.Becauseof thisleadof the compasscard,orfloatassembly,a northerly turn should be stopped prior to arrival at the desired heading. This compass erroris amplified with the proximity toeither magneticpole. One rule of thumb to correct for this leading error is to stop the turn 15 degrees plus half of the latitude (i.e., if the aircraft is being operated in a position near 40 degrees latitude, the turn should be stopped  $15{+}20{=}35$  degrees prior to the desired heading).[Figure8-36A]  

Southerly Turning Errors  

When turning in a southerly direction, the forces are such that the compass float assembly lags rather than leads. The result is a false southerly turn indication.The compass card,or float assembly, should be allowed to pass the desired heading prior to stopping the turn. As with the northerly error, this error is amplified with the proximity to either magnetic pole. To correct this lagging error, the aircraft should be allowed to pass the desired heading prior to stopping the turn. The same rule of 15 degrees plus half of the latitude applies here (i.e., if the aircraft is being operated in a position near 30 degrees latitude, the turn should be stopped  $15{+}15{+}30$  degreesafter passing the desired heading).[Figure8-36B]  

# Acceleration Error  

Themagneticdipandtheforcesofinertiacausemagnetic compass errors when accelerating and decelerating on easterly and westerly headings. Because of the pendulous- type mounting, the aft end of the compass card is tilted upward when accelerating and downward when decelerating during changes of airspeed.When accelerating on either an easterly or westerly heading,the error appears as a turn indication toward north. When decelerating on either of these headings,the compass indicates a turn toward south. A mnemonic, or memory jogger, for the effect of acceleration error is the word“ANDS"(Acceleration- North/Deceleration-South)may help you to remember the acceleration error.[Figure8-37]Acceleration causes an

indication toward north; deceleration causes an indication towardsouth.  

# Oscillation Error  

Oscillation is a combination of all of the errors previously mentioned and results in fluctuation of the compass card in relation to the actual heading direction of the aircraft.When setting the gyroscopic heading indicator to agreewiththe magneticcompass,use the average indication between the swings.  

# The Vertical Card Magnetic Compass  

The vertical card magnetic compass eliminates some of the errors and confusion encountered with the magnetic compass. The dial of this compassis graduated withletters representing the cardinal directions,numbersevery  $30^{\circ}$  andtickmarks every  $5^{\circ}$  .The dial is rotated by a set of gears from theshaft- mountedmagnet,andthenoseofthesymbolicaircraft on the instrument glass represents the lubber line for reading the headingof the aircraft from the dial.[Figure8-38]  

# LagsorLeads  

When starting a turnfrom a northerly heading,thecompass lags behind the turn.When starting a turn from a southerly heading,thecompassleads theturn.  

![](images/01d29d849b416705e8539240691cfcce84da0183c513582fb1845ca190510b03.jpg)  
Figure8-38.Vertical card magnetic compass.  

# Eddy Current Damping  

In the case of a vertical card magnetic compass,flux from the oscillating permanent magnet produces eddy currents in a damping disk or cup. The magnetic flux produced by the eddy currents opposes the flux from the permanent magnet and decreases the oscillations.  

# Outside Air Temperature (OAT) Gauge  

The outside air temperature (OAT) gauge is a simple and effective device mounted so that the sensing element is exposed to the outside air.The sensing element consists ofabimetallic-typethermometerinwhichtwodissimilar materials are welded together in a single strip and twisted intoahelix.Oneendis anchored into protective tube and the other end is affixed to the pointer,which reads against the calibration on a circular face. OAT gauges are calibrated in degrees  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  ,orboth.An accurate air temperature provides the pilot with useful information about temperature lapse rate with altitude change.[Figure8-39]

Flight instruments enable an aircraft to be operated with maximum performance and enhanced safety,especiallywhen flying long distances. Manufacturers provide the necessary flight instruments, but to use them effectively, pilots need to understand how they operate. As a pilot, it is important to become very familiar with the operational aspects of the pitot- static system and associated instruments,thevacuum system and associated instruments, the gyroscopic instruments, and the magnetic compass.  

# Flight and Other  

# Introduction  

Each aircraft comeswith documentation and asetof manuals with which a pilot must befamiliar in order tofly that aircraft. Thischapter covers airplane flight manuals(AFM),the pilot's operating handbook (POH), and aircraft documents pertaining to ownership, airworthiness, maintenance, and Operations with inoperative equipment. Knowledge of these required documents and manuals is essential for a pilot to conduct asafeflight.  

# Airplane Flight Manuals (AFM)  

Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference books that provide specific information about a particular aircraft or subject. They contain basic facts, information, and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept on hand for ready reference.  

The aircraft owner/information manual is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general information about the make and model of the aircraft. The manual is not approved by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA)and is not specific to an individual aircraft.The manual provides general information about the operation of an aircraft,is not kept current,andcannotbe substituted for the AFM/POH.  

An AFM is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer and approved by the FAA.This book contains the information and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely. A pilot must comply with this information which is specific to a particularmake and model of aircraft,usuallybyserial number. An AFM contains the operating procedures and limitationsof thataircraft.Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 requires that pilots comply with the operating limitations specified in the approved flight manuals,markings,andplacards.  

Originally,flight manuals followed whatever format and content the manufacturer felt was appropriate,butthis changed with the acceptance of Specification No. 1 prepared bytheGeneralAviationManufacturersAssociation(GAMA) SpecificationNo.1 established a standardized format for all general aviation airplane and helicopter flight manuals.  

ThePOHisadocumentdevelopedbytheaircraft manufacturer andcontainsFAA-approved AFMinformation. If“POH"isused inthemaintitle,astatementmust be includedonthe title page indicating thatsections of the document are FAA approved as the AFM.  

The POH for most light aircraft built after1975isalso designated astheFAA-approved flight manual.Thetypical AFM/POH contains the following nine sections:General; Limitations; Emergency Procedures; Normal Procedures; Performance; Weight and Balance/Equipment List; Systems Description; Handling, Service, and Maintenance; and Supplements. Manufacturers also have the option of including additional sections,such as one on Safety and Operational Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.  

# Preliminary Pages  

While the AFM/POH may appear similar for the same make and model of aircraft, each manual is unique and contains specific information about a particular aircraft,suchasthe equipment installed and weight and balance information. Manufacturers are required toinclude the serial number and registration on the title page to identify the aircraft to which the manual belongs.If a manual does not indicate a specific aircraft registration and serial number, it is limited to general study purposes only.  

Most manufacturers include a table of contents that identifies the order of the entire manual by section number and title. Usually,each section also contains a table of contents for that section.Page numbers reflect the section and page within that section (1-1,1-2,2-1,3-1,etc.).If the manual is published inloose-leafform,each section is usually marked with a divider tabindicating thesectionnumber,title,orboth.The Emergency Procedures sectionmayhave a red tabfor quick identification and reference.  

# General (Section 1)  

The General section provides the basic descriptive information on the airframe and powerplant(s).Some manualsincludea three-dimensional drawingof theaircraft that provides dimensions of various components.Included are such items as wingspan, maximum height, overall length. wheelbase length, main landing gear track width, diameter of the rotor system, maximum propeller diameter, propeller groundclearance,minimum turning radius,andwing area. This section serves as a quick reference and helps a pilot become familiar with the aircraft.  

The last segment of theGeneral section contains definitions, abbreviations,explanations of symbology,andsome of the terminology used in the POH.At the discretion of the manufacturer, metric and other conversion tables may alsc beincluded.  

# Limitations (Section 2)  

The Limitations section contains only those limitations required by regulation or that are necessary for the safe operation of the aircraft, powerplant, systems, and equipment. It includes operating limitations, instrument markings, color-coding, and basic placards.Some of the limitation areas are airspeed. powerplant, weight and loading distribution, and flight.  

# Airspeed  

Airspeed limitations are shown on the airspeed indicator (ASl)by color coding and on placards or graphs in the aircraft.[Figure9-1]A red line on the AS I shows the airspeed limit beyond which structural damage could occur. This is called the never-exceed speed  $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  . A yellow arc indicates the speed range between maximum structural cruising speed  $\mathrm{(V_{N0})}$  and  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  .Operation of an aircraft in the yellow airspeed arc is for smooth air only and then only with caution. A green arc depicts the normal operating speed range, with the upper endat  $\mathrm{V_{N0}}$  and the lower end at stalling speed at maximum weight with the landing gear and flaps retracted  $(\mathrm{V}_{S1})$  . For airplanes, the flap operating range is depicted by the white arc, with the upper end at the maximum flap extended speed  $\mathrm{(V_{FE})}$  , and the lower end at the stalling speed with the landing gear and flaps in the landing configuration  $(\mathrm{V_{S0}})$  

![](images/1756e0cc3c47dadf608ca6d64965e134e235dce2fb24443627b255d35b328dbd.jpg)  
Figure9-1.Single-engine airspeed indicator.  

In addition to the markings listed above, small multi-engine airplanes have a red radial line to indicate single-engine minimum controllable airspeed  $\left({\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{MC}}\right)$  . A blue radial line is used to indicate single-engine best rate of climb speed at maximumweight at sealevel  $\mathrm{(V_{YSE})}$  .[Figure9-2]  

# Powerplant  

The Powerplant Limitations portion describes operating limitations on an aircraft's reciprocating or turbine engine(s). These include limitations for takeoff power,maximum continuous power, and maximum normal operating power, whichis themaximum power the engine can produce without any restrictions and is depicted by a green arc. Other items that can be included in this area are the minimum and maximum oil and fuel pressures, oil and fuel grades, and propeller operating limits.[Figure9-3]  

All reciprocating-engine powered aircraft must have a revolutions per minute(rpm)indicator for each engine. Aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller or rotor system use a manifold pressure gauge to monitor power output and a tachometer to monitor propeller or rotor speed. Both instruments depict the maximum operating limit with

# Weight and Loading Distribution  

Weight and Loading Distribution contains the maximum certificated weights,as well as the center of gravity(CG) range. The location of the reference datum used in balance computations is included in this section.Weight and balance computations are not provided in this area, but rather in the weight and balance section of the AFM/POH.

Figure9-4.Manifoldpressuregauge(top)and tachometer(bottom)  

# FlightLimits  

Flight Limits list authorized maneuvers with appropriate entry speeds, flight load factor limits, and types of operation limits. It also indicates those maneuvers that are prohibited, such as spins or acrobatic flight,as well as operational limitations such as flight intoknown icing conditions.  

# Placards  

Most aircraft display one or more placards that contain information having a directbearing on the safe operation of theaircraft.These placards are located inconspicuous places and are reproduced in the Limitations section or as directed by an Air worthiness Directive(AD).[Figure9-5]Airworthiness Directives areexplained in detail later in this chapter.  

# Emergency Procedures (Section 3)  

Checklists describing the recommended procedures and airspeeds for copingwith various types of emergencies or critical situations are located in the Emergency Procedures section.Some of the emergencies covered include: engine failure, fire, and system failure. The procedures for inflight engine restarting andditching may alsobe included. Manufacturers may first show an emergency checklist in an abbreviated form with the order of items reflecting the sequence of action.Amplified checklists that provide additional information on the procedures follow the abbreviated checklist. To be prepared for emergency situations,memorize the immediate action items and, after completion,refer tothe appropriate checklist.

Figure9-5.Placards are used to depict aircraft limitations  

Manufacturers may include an optional subsection entitled Abnormal Procedures. This subsection describes recommended procedures for handling malfunctions that are not considered emergencies  

# Normal Procedures (Section 4)  

This section begins with a list of the airspeed s for normal operations.The next area consists of several checklists that may include preflight inspection, before starting procedures, starting engine, before taxiing, taxiing, before takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, before landing, balked landing, after landing and post flight procedures. An Amplified Procedures area follows the checklists toprovidemore detailed information about the various previously mentioned procedures.  

To avoid missing important steps,alwaysusethe appropriate checklists when available.Consistent adherence to approved checklists is a sign of a disciplined and competent pilot.  

# Performance (Section 5)  

The Performance section contains all theinformation required by the aircraft certification regulations and any additional performance information the manufacturer deems important to pilot ability to safely operate the aircraft.Performance charts, tables, and graphs vary in style, but all contain the samebasic information.Examples of the performance information found in most flight manuals include a graph or table for converting calibrated airspeed to true airspeed; stall speeds in various configurations; and data for determining takeoff and climb performance, cruise performance, and landing performance. Figure 9-6 is an example of a typical performance graph.For more information on use of the charts, graphs, and tables, refer to Chapter 10, Aircraft Performance.  

# Weight and Balance/Equipment List (Section 6)  

TheWeight andBalance/Equipment List section contains all the information required by the FAA to calculate the weight and balance of an aircraft.Manufacturers include sample weight and balance problems.Weight and balance is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10, Weight and Balance.  

# Systems Description (Section 7)  

This section describes the aircraft systems in a manner appropriate to the pilot most likely to operate the aircraft. For example, a manufacturer might assume an experienced pilotwill bereading the information for an advanced aircraft. For moreinformation on aircraft systems,refer to Chapter 7,AircraftSystems.  

![](images/4d6588d3e85c8ab2ac92eecfcd4a1c1ee3d10c91a6e168b47054638c6c5497ad.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.Stall speed chart.  

# Handling, Service, and Maintenance (Section 8)  

The Handling, Service, and Maintenance section describes the maintenance and inspections recommended by the manufacturer(and theregulations).Additional maintenance or inspections maybe required by the issuance of ADs applicable to the airframe, engine, propeller, or components. This section also describes preventive maintenance that may be accomplished by certificated pilots, as well as the manufacturer's recommended ground handling procedures. It includes considerations for hangaring, tie-down, and general storage procedures for the aircraft.  

# Supplements (Section 9)  

The Supplements section contains information necessary tosafelyandefficientlyoperatetheaircraftwhenequipped with optional systems and equipment (notprovidedwith the standard aircraft). Some of this information may be supplied by the aircraft manufacturer or by themanufacturer of the optional equipment. The appropriate information is inserted into the flight manual at the time the equipment is installed. Autopilots, navigation systems, and air-conditioning systems are examples of equipment described in thissection. [Figure9-7]  

![](images/7b2b7b99b9964bf96fec6a3f85649223c9da2853a9d8d745e450ef7c891fd6c7.jpg)  
Figure9-7.Supplements provide information on optional equipment  

# Safety Tips (Section 10)  

TheSafetyTips section is an optional section containing a review ofinformation that enhances the safe operation of the aircraft. For example, physiological factors, general weather information,fuel conservation procedures,high altitude operations,or cold weather operations mightbe discussed.  

# Aircraft Documents  

# Certificate of Aircraft Registration  

Before an aircraft can be flown legally, it must be registered with theFAA Aircraft Registry.TheCertificate of Aircraft Registration,whichis issued to the owner asevidence of the registration, must be carried in the aircraft at all times. [Figure9-8]  

The Certificate of Aircraft Registration cannot be used for operationswhen:  

The aircraft is registered under the laws of a foreign country  

The aircraft's registration is canceled upon written request of the certificate holder The aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped The ownership of the aircraft is transferred The certificate holder loses United States citizenship  

For additional information, see 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41. When one of theevents listed in14 CFR part 47,section 47.41 occurs, the previous owner must notify the FAA by fillingin theback of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration, andmailingitto:  

FAA Aircraft Registration Branch,AFS-750 P.O.B0x25504 OklahomaCity,OK 73125-0504  

A dealer's aircraft registration certificate is another form of registration certificate, but is valid only for required flight tests by the manufacturer or in flights that are necessary for

Figure 9-8.AC Form 8050-3, Certificate of Aircraft Registration  

thesaleof the aircraft by themanufacturer or a dealer. The dealer must remove the certificate when the aircraftissold.  

Upon complying with 14 CFR part 47, section 47.31, the pink copy of the application for an Aircraft Registration Application,Aeronautical Center (AC) Form 8050-1, provides authorization tooperate an unregistered aircraft for a period not to exceed 90 days.Since the aircraft is unregistered,it cannot be operated outside of the United States until a permanent Certificate of Aircraft Registration is received and placed in the aircraft.  

TheFAAdoesnot issue any certificate of ownership or endorse any information with respect to ownership on a Certificate of Aircraft Registration.  

NOTE: For additional information concerning the Aircraft Registration Application or the Aircraft Bill of Sale, contact the nearest FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  

# Airworthiness Certificate  

An Air worthiness Certificate is issued by a representative of the FAA after the aircraft has been inspected,isfoundtomeet the requirements of 14 CFRpart21,and is in condition for safe operation.The Airworthiness Certificate must be displayed in the aircraft soit islegible to the passengers and crew whenever itisoperated.The Air worthiness Certificate must remain with the aircraft unless it is sold to a foreign purchaser.  

A Standard Air worthiness Certificate is issued for aircraft type certificated in the normal,utility,acrobatic,commuter, transport categories, and manned free balloons. Figure 9-9 illustrates a Standard Airworthiness Certificate,and an explanation of eachitemin the certificate follows.  

1. Nationality and Registration Marks.The“N" indicates the aircraft is registered in the United States. Registration marks consist of a series of up to five numbers or numbers andletters.In this case,N2631A is the registration number assigned tothis aircraft.  

2. Manufacturer andModel.Indicates themanufacturer make, and model of the aircraft.  

3.Aircraft Serial Number.Indicates the manufacturer's serial number assigned to the aircraft, as noted on the aircraft data plate.  

4. Category.Indicates the category in which the aircraft must be operated. In this case, it must be operated in accordance with the limitations specified for the "NORMAL"category.  

5. Authority and Basis for Issuance.Indicates the aircraft conforms to its type certificate and is considered in condition for safe operation at the time of inspection and issuance of the certificate.Any exemptions from the applicable air worthiness standards are briefly noted here and the exemption number given. The word ‘NONE"is entered if no exemption exists.  

![Figure9-9.FAAForm8100-2,Standard Air worthiness Certificate ](images/ab8145511ec24e7d29fab8e9af77c2b92ea1e53fc5858d53a668772e5175466a.jpg)  

6.Terms and Conditions.Indicates the Air worthiness Certificate isin effect indefinitely if the aircraft is maintainedin accordance with14CFR parts 21,43,and 91, and the aircraft is registered in the United States.  

Alsoincluded are the date the certificate was issued and the signature and office identification of the FAA representative  

A Standard Air worthiness Certificate remains in effect if the aircraft receives therequired maintenance and is properly registered in theUnited States.Flight safety relies in part on the condition of the aircraft, which is determined by inspections performed by mechanics, approved repair stations,or manufacturers that meet specific requirements of14CFRpart43.  

A Special Air worthiness Certificate is issued for all aircraft certificatedin other than the Standard classifications,such as Experimental, Restricted, Limited, Provisional, and Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA). LSA receive a pink special airworthiness certificate; however, there are exceptions. For example,the Piper Cub is in the LSA category,but it was certificated as a normal aircraft during its manufacture. When purchasing an aircraft classified as other thanStandard, itisrecommended that the local FS DO be contacted for an explanation of the pertinent airworthiness requirements and the limitations of such a certificate.  

# Aircraft Maintenance  

Maintenance is defined as the preservation,inspection, overhaul, and repair of an aircraft, including the replacement of parts. Regular and proper maintenance ensures that an aircraft meets an acceptable standard of airworthiness throughout its operational life.  

Although maintenance requirements vary for different types of aircraft, experience shows that aircraft need some typeof preventive maintenance every25hours of flying timeor less and minor maintenance atleast every100 hours.This is influenced by thekind of operation,climatic conditions, storage facilities, age, and construction of the aircraft. Manufacturers supply maintenance manuals, parts catalogs,and other service information that should be used in maintaining the aircraft.  

# Aircraft Inspections  

Under 14 CFR part 91,the primary responsibility for maintaining an aircraft in an airworthy condition falls on the owner or operator of the aircraft.Certain inspections must be performed on the aircraft,and the owner must maintain the air worthiness of the aircraft during the time between required inspections by having any defects corrected.  

Under 14 CFR, part 91, subpart E, all civil aircraft are required tobeinspected at specific intervals to determine the overall condition.The interval depends upon thetype of operations in which the aircraft is engaged.All aircraft need to be inspected at least once every 12 calendar months, whileinspection is required for others after every 1o0hours of operation. Some aircraft are inspected in accordance with an inspection system set up to provide for total inspection of the aircraft on the basis of calendar time,time in service, number of system operations, or any combination of these.  

All inspections should follow the current manufacturer's maintenance manual,including the Instructions for Continued Air worthiness concerning inspection intervals, parts replacement, and life-limited items as applicable to theaircraft.  

# Annual Inspection  

Any reciprocating engine or single-engine turbojet/ turbopropeller-powered small aircraft(weighing12,500 pounds or less） flown for business or pleasure and notflown for compensation or hire is required to be inspected at least annually.The inspection shallbe performedby a certificated airframe and powerplant(A&P)mechanic who holds an inspection authorization(IA)by themanufacturer of the aircraft or by a certificated and appropriately rated repairstation.The aircraft may not be operated unless the annual inspection has been performed within the preceding 12calendarmonths.Aperiodof12calendarmonthsextends fromanydayof a month tothelastdayof thesamemonth the following year. An aircraft overdue for an annual inspection maybe operated under aSpecial FlightPermit issued by the FAA for the purpose of flying the aircraft to a location wherethe annual inspection canbeperformed.However,all applicable ADs that are due must be complied with before theflight.  

# 100-Hour Inspection  

All aircraft under 12,500 pounds(except turbojet/ turbopropeller-poweredmulti-engine airplanes and turbine powered rotorcraft), used to carry passengers for hire, must receive a100-hour inspection within the preceding 100hours of time in service and must be approved for return to service. Additionally,an aircraft used for flight instruction for hire, when provided by the person giving the flight instruction, must also have received a 10o-hour inspection. This inspection must be performed by an FAA-certificatedA&Pmechanic, an appropriately rated FAA-certificated repair station, or by the aircraft manufacturer.An annual inspection,or an inspection for the issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate, may be substituted for a required 1oo-hour inspection. The 100-hour limitation may be exceeded by no more than 10 hoursfor thepurpose of travelingtoa location atwhich the required inspection can be performed. Any excess time used for this purpose must be included in computing the next 100 hours of time in service.  

# Other Inspection Programs  

The annual and 1oo-hour inspection requirements do not apply to large (over 12,500 pounds) airplanes, turbojets, or turbopropeller-powered multi-engine airplanes or to aircraft for which the owner complies with a progressive inspection program. Details of these requirements may be determined by referencing 14 CFR, part 43, section 43.11 and 14 CFR part 91, subpart E, or by inquiring at a local FSDO.  

# Altimeter System Inspection  

Under 14CFR,part 91,section91.411,requiresthat the altimeter,encodingaltimeter,andrelatedsystemmustbe tested and inspected within the 24 months prior to operating in controlled airspace underinstrument flight rules (IFR). This applies to all aircraft being operated in controlled airspace  

# Transponder Inspection  

Title 14 CFR,part 91, section 91.413,requires that before a transponder can be used under 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.215(a),it shall be tested and inspected within the 24 months prior to operation of the aircraft regardless of airspace restrictions.  

# Emergency Locator Transmitter  

An emergency locator transmitter (ELT)is required by 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.207,and must be inspected within 12 calendar months after thelast inspection forthefollowing:  

Proper installation Battery corrosion Operation of the controls and crashsensor The presence of a sufficient signal radiated from its antenna  

The ELT must be attached to the airplane in such a manner that theprobability of damage to thetransmitter in the event of crash impactis minimized.Fixed and deployable automatic type transmitters must be attached to the airplane as far aft as practicable. Batteries used in the ELTs must be replaced (or recharged,if the batteries are rechargeable):  

When the transmitter has been in use for more than 1 cumulativehour When 50 percent of the battery useful life or, for rechargeable batteries,50percent of usefullifeof the charge has expired  

An expiration date for replacing (or recharging) the battery must be legibly marked on the outside of the transmitter and entered in the aircraft maintenance record.This does not apply to batteries that are essentially unaffected during storage intervals,such aswater-activated batteries.  

# Pre flight Inspections  

Thepreflight inspectionis a thorough and systematic means by which a pilot determines if anaircraftis airworthyandin condition for safe operation. POHs and owner/information manuals contain a section devoted to a systematic method of performing a pre flight inspection  

# Minimum Equipment Lists (MEL) and Operations With Inoperative Equipment  

Under14CFR,all aircraft instruments and installed equipment are required tobeoperative prior toeachdeparture.When the FAA adopted the minimum equipment list (MEL) concept for 14 CFR part 91 operations, it allowed aircraft to be operated withinoperative equipment determined to be nonessential for safeflight.Atthesametime,it allowed part 91 operators without an MEL,to defer repairs on nonessential equipment within the guidelines of part91.  

The FAA has two acceptable methods of deferring maintenance on small rotor craft,non-turbinepowered airplanes, gliders, or lighter-than-air aircraft operated under part 91. They are the deferral provision of 14 CFR, part 91, section91.213(d)andanFAA-approvedMEL  

Thedeferralprovisionof14CFR,part91,section91.213(d) is widely used by most pilot/operators.Its popularity is due to simplicity and minimal paperwork.When inoperative equipment is found during a preflight inspection or prior to departure,the decision should be to cancel the flight,obtain maintenance prior to flight,or to defer the item or equipment  

Maintenance deferrals are notused forinflight discrepancies Themanufacturer'sAFM/POH procedures are to be used in thosesituations.The discussion that follows assumes that the pilotwishes to defer maintenance that would ordinarily berequiredprior toflight  

Using the defer ral provision of 14CFR,part 91,section 91.213(d),the pilot determines whether the inoperative equipment is required by type design,14 CFR,or ADs.If the inoperative item is not required,andthe aircraftcanbe safely operated without it, the deferral may be made. The inoperative item shall be deactivated or removed and an INOPERATIVE placard placed near the appropriate switch, control,orindicator.If deactivation or removal involves maintenance(removal alwayswill),it mustbe accomplished by certificated maintenance personnel and recorded in accordance with 14 CFRpart 43  

For example, if the position lights (installed equipment) were discovered to be inoperative prior to a daytime flight the pilot would follow the requirements of 14 CFR, part 91, section91.213(d)  

The deactivation may be a process as simple as the pilot positioning a circuit breaker to the OFF position or as complex as rendering instruments or equipment totally inoperable.Complex maintenance tasksrequire a certificated and appropriately rated maintenance person to perform the deactivation. In all cases, the item or equipment must be placarded INOPERATIVE.  

All small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered airplanes, gliders. or lighter-than-air aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 91 are eligible to use the maintenance defer ral provisions of 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.213(d). However, once an operator requestsanMEL,andaLetterofAuthorization(LOA) is issued by the FAA,then the use of the MEL becomes mandatory for that aircraft.All maintenance defer ral s must be accomplished in accordance with the terms and conditions of theMEL and theoperator-generated procedures document.  

The use of an MEL for an aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 91 also allows for the defer ral of inoperative items or equipment. The primary guidance becomes the FAA-approved MELissued tothat specific operator and N-numberedaircraft.  

The FAA has developed master minimum equipment lists (MMELs)for aircraft in current use.Upon written request by an operator, the local FSDO may issue the appropriate make and model MMEL,along with an LOA, and the preamble. The operator then develops operations and maintenance (O&M) procedures from theMMEL.This MMEL with O&M procedures now becomes the operator's MEL. The MEL, LOA,preamble, and procedures document developed by the operator must be onboard the aircraft during each operation. The FAA considers an approved MEL to be a supplemental typecertificate(STC)issued to an aircraft by serial number and registration number. It, therefore, becomes the authority tooperatethat aircraftina conditionother thanoriginally type certificated.  

With an approved MEL,if the position lights were discovered inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the pilot would make an entry in the maintenance record or discrepancy record provided for thatpurpose.The item would then either be repaired or deferred in accordance with the MEL.Upon confirming that daytime flight with inoperative position lights is acceptable in accordance with the provisions of the MEL,the pilot would leave the position lights switch OFF open the circuit breaker(or whatever action is called for in the procedures document),and placard the position light switchasINOPERATIVE.  

There are exceptions to the use of the MEL for defer ral.For example, should a component fail thatis not listed in the MEL as deferrable (the tachometer, flaps, or stall warning device, forexample),thenrepairs arerequired tobeperformed prior to departure. If maintenance or parts are not readily available at that location, a special flight permit can be obtained from the nearest FSDO. This permit allows the aircraft to be flown to another location for maintenance.Thisallowsan aircraft that may not currently meet applicable air worthiness requirements, but is capable of safe flight, to be operated under the restrictive special terms andconditions attached to thespecial flightpermit.  

Deferral of maintenance is not to be taken lightly, and due consideration should be given to the effect an inoperative component may have on the operation of an aircraft. particularly if other items are inoperative.Further information regarding MELs and operations with inoperative equipment can be found in AC 91-67, Minimum Equipment Requirements forGeneral Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91.  

# Preventive Maintenance  

Preventive maintenance is regardedas simple or minon preservation operations and the replacement of small standard parts,not involving complex assembly operations.Allowed items of preventative maintenance are listed and limited to the items of 14 CFR part 43,appendix A(c).  

# Maintenance Entries  

All pilots who perform preventive maintenance must make an entry in the maintenance record of the aircraft. The entry must include the following information:  

1. A description of the work, such as “changed oil (Shell Aero-50)at2,345hours' 2. The date of completion of the work performed 3. The pilot's name, signature, certificate number, and type of certificate held  

# Examples of Preventive Maintenance  

The following examples of preventive maintenance are taken from14CFR,part43,Maintenance,Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding, and Alternation, which should be consulted for a more in-depth look at the preventive maintenance a pilot can perform on an aircraft. Remember, preventive maintenance is limited to work that does not involve complex assembly operations including thefollowing:

(Sportpilots operating LSA should refer to14CFRpart 65 for maintenance privileges.) 14 CFR part 43, appendix A, contains a list of the operations that are considered tobe preventive maintenance.  

# Repairs and Alterations  

Repairsand alterations areclassified aseithermajororminor. 14 CFR part 43, appendix A, describes the alterations and repairs considered major. Major repairs or alterations shall be approved for return to service on FAA Form 337, Major Repair and Alteration, by an appropriately rated certificated repair station,anFAA-certificatedA&P mechanicholding an IA, or a representative of the Administrator. Minor repairs and minor alterations maybe approved for return toservicewith a properentryin themaintenance records by an FAA-certificated A&Pmechanic or an appropriately certificated repair station.  

For modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the operating limitations issued tothat aircraft.Modifications in accordance with FAA Order 8130.2,Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft and Related Products,mayrequire the notification of theissuing authority.  

# Special FlightPermits  

A special flight permit is aSpecial Airworthiness Certificate authorizing operation of an aircraft that does not currently meetapplicableairworthinessrequirementsbutissafe for a specific flight. Before the permit is issued, an FAA inspector may personally inspect the aircraft or require it to be inspected by an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic or an appropriately certificated repair station to determine its safety for the intended flight. The inspection shall be recorded in the aircraft records.  

The special flight permit is issued to allowthe aircrafttobe flown to a base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance canbeperformed;for delivering orexporting the aircraft;on for evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger. A special flight permit may be issued to allow the operation of an overweight aircraft for flight beyond its normal range over water or land areas where adequate landing facilities or fuel is not available.  

If a special flightpermit isneeded,assistance and the necessary forms maybe obtained from the local FS DO or Designated Air worthiness Representative(DAR) [Figure9-10]  

# Airworthiness Directives (ADs)  

A primary safety function of the FAA is to require correction of unsafe conditions found in an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller,or appliance when such conditions exist and are likely toexistor develop in other products of the same design. The unsafe condition may exist because of a design defect, maintenance,orothercauses.Air worthiness Directives (ADs), under 14 CFR, part 39, define the authority and responsibility of the Administrator for requiring the necessary corrective action.ADs are used to notify aircraft owners and other interested persons of unsafe conditions and to specify theconditions under which theproduct may continue tobe operated.ADs are divided into two categories:  

1。 Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate compliance prior to further flight 2.  Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance within a specified period of time  

ADs are regulatory and shall be complied with unless a specific exemption is granted. It is the responsibility of the aircraft owner or operator to ensure compliance with all pertinent ADs, including those ADs that require recurrent or continuing action. For example, an AD may require a repetitive inspection each 50 hours of operation, meaning the particular inspections hall be accomplished and recorded every5ohoursoftimeinservice.Owners/operatorsare reminded that there is no provision to over fly themaximum hour requirement of an AD unless it is specifically written intotheAD.To help determine if an AD applies to an amateur-built aircraft, contact the local FSDO  

14 CFR,part 91,section91.417 requires a record to be maintained that shows the current status of applicable ADs,including the method of compliance;theADnumber and revision date, if recurring; next due date and time; the signature;type of certificate; and certificate number of the repair station or mechanic who performed the work. For ready reference,many aircraft ownershave a chronological listing of the pertinent ADs in the back of their aircraft,engine,and propeller maintenance records.  

AllADs and the AD Biweekly are free on the Internet at http://rgl.faa.gov and are available through e-mail. Individuals can enroll for the e-mail service at the website above.Paper copies of the Summary of Air worthiness Directives and the AD Biweekly may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents. The Summary contains all the valid ADs previously published and is divided into

# AircraftOwner/Operator Responsibilities  

The registered owner/operator of an aircraft is responsible for:  

Having a current Airworthiness Certificate and a Certificate of Aircraft Registration in the aircraft. Maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition. including compliance with all applicable ADs and assuring that maintenance is properly recorded. Keeping abreast of current regulations concerningthe operation and maintenance of the aircraft. Notifying the FAA Aircraft Registry immediately of any change of permanent mailing address, of the sale or export of the aircraft,or of the loss of the eligibility to register an aircraft.(Refer to 14 CFR,part 47, section47.41.)  

Having a current Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio station license if equipped with radios, including emergency locator transmitter (ELT), if operated outside of the United States.  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of an aircraft'sAFM/POH and documents, such as ADs, provide pilots with ready access to pertinent information needed to safely fly a particular aircraft. By understanding the operations, limitations, and performance characteristics of the aircraft, the pilot can make educated flight decisions.By learning what preventive maintenance is allowed on the aircraft, a pilot can maintain his or her aircraft in an airworthy condition. The goal of every pilot is a safe flight. Flight manuals and aircraft documentation are essential toolsused toreach thatgoal.  

Chapter  

# Weight 250 and  

# Introduction  

Compliance with the weight and balancelimits of any aircraft iscriticaltoflightsafety.Operatingabovethemaximum weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of an aircraft and adversely affects its performance. Operation with the center of gravity (CG) outside the approved limits results in control difficulty.  

# Weight Control  

As discussedin Chapter 5,Aerodynamics of Flight,weight is the force with which gravity attracts a body toward the centeroftheEarth.Itisaproductofthemassofabodyand the acceleration acting on the body.Weight is a major factor in aircraft construction and operation and demands respect from all pilots.  

The force of gravity continuously attempts to pull an aircraft down toward Earth. The force of lift is the only force that counteracts weight and sustains an aircraft in flight. The amount of lift produced by an airfoil is limited by the airfoil design, angle of attack (AOA), airspeed, and air density. To assure that the lift generated is sufficient to counteract weight. loading an aircraft beyond the manufacturer's recommended weight must be avoided. If the weight is greater than the lift generated, the aircraft may be incapable of flight  

# Effects of Weight  

Any item aboard an aircraft that increases the total weight is undesirable for performance. Manufacturers attempt to make an aircraft as light as possible without sacrificing strength orsafety.  

Thepilotshouldalwaysbeawareoftheconsequencesof overloading.An overloaded aircraft may not be able to leave theground,orif it does become airborne,itmayexhibit unexpected and unusually poor flight characteristics. If not properly loaded, the initial indication of poor performance usually takes place during takeoff  

Excessive weight reduces theflight performancein almost every respect. For example, the mostimportant performance deficienciesof an overloaded aircraft are:  

Higher takeoff speed Longer takeoff run Reduced rate and angle of climb Lowermaximum altitude Shorter range Reduced cruising speed Reduced maneuverability Higher stalling speed Higher approach and landing speed Longer landing roll Excessive weight on thenosewheel or tailwheel  

Thepilot must beknowledgeable about the effect of weight on the performance of the particular aircraft being flown. Preflight planning should include a check of performance charts to determine if the aircraft's weight may contribute to hazardous flight operations. Excessive weight in itself reduces the safety margins available to the pilot and becomes even more hazardous when other performance-reducing factors are combined with excess weight.Thepilotmust also consider the consequences of an overweight aircraft if an emergency condition arises. If an engine fails on takeoff or airframe ice forms at low altitude,it is usually too late to reduce an aircraft's weight tokeep it in the air.  

# Weight Changes  

The operatingweight of an aircraftcan be changed by simply altering the fuel load.Gasoline has considerable weight6 pounds per gallon. Thirty gallons of fuel may weigh more than one passenger. If a pilot lowers airplane weight by reducing fuel, the resulting decrease in the range of the airplane must be taken into consideration during flight planning. During flight, fuel burn is normally the only weight change that takes place.As fuel is used, an aircraft becomes lighter and performance is improved.  

Changes of fixed equipment have a major effect upon the weight of an aircraft. The installation of extra radios or instruments, as well as repairs or modifications, may also affect the weight of an aircraft  

# Balance, Stability, and Center of Gravity  

Balancerefers to thelocation of theCGof an aircraft,and is important to stability and safetyinflight.The CGis apoint at which the aircraft would balance if it weresuspended at thatpoint.  

The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis.The CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on thedistribution of weight in the aircraft.Asvariableload items are shifted or expended,there is a resultant shift in CGlocation.The distance between the forward andback limitsfor theposition of the center for gravity or CGrange is certified for an aircraft by the manufacturer.The pilot should realize that if the CG is displaced too far forward on the longitudinal axis,a nose-heavy condition will result. Conversely, if the CG is displaced too far aft on the longitudinalaxis,atailheavyconditionresults.Itispossible that the pilot could not control the aircraft if the CG location produced an unstable condition.[Figure10-1]  

Location of the CG with reference to the lateral axis is also important. For each item of weight existing to the left of  

![](images/57d8afec0238c9a167be841a8c36f6377ee219923667fbc30f2bddc953bd2d30.jpg)  
Figure1o-1.Lateral and longitudinal unbalance.  

the fuselage center line,there is an equal weight existing at a corresponding location on the right.This maybeupset by unbalanced lateral loading. The position of the lateral CG is not computed in all aircraft, but the pilot must be aware that adverse effects arise as a result of a laterally unbalanced condition. In an airplane, lateral unbalance occurs if the fuel load is mismanaged by supplying the engine(s) unevenlyfrom tanks on one side of the airplane.The pilot can compensatefor theresulting wing-heavycondition by adjusting the trim or by holding a constant control pressure. This action places the aircraft controls in an out-of-streamline condition, increases drag, and results in decreased operating efficiency. Sincelateral balanceis addressed when neededin the aircraftflightmanual(AFM)andlongitudinalbalanceis more critical, further reference to balance in this handbook means longitudinal location of the CG  

Flying an aircraft that is out of balance can produce increased pilot fatigue with obvious effects on thesafety andefficiency offlight.Thepilot's natural correction for longitudinal un balance is a change of trim to remove the excessive control pressure. Excessive trim, however, has the effect of reducing notonly aerodynamic efficiency but also primary control travel distance in the direction the tri misapplied.  

# Effects of Adverse Balance  

Adverse balance conditions affect flight characteristics in much the same manner as those mentioned for an excess weightcondition.It is vital to comply with weight and balancelimits establishedfor all aircraft.Operating above the maximum weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of the aircraft and can adversely affect performance. Stability and control are also affected by improper balance.  

# Stability  

Loadinginanose-heavyconditioncausesproblemsin controlling and raising the nose, especially during takeoff andlanding.Loading in a tail heavy condition has a serious effect upon longitudinal stability,and reduces thecapability to recover from stalls and spins.Tail heavy loading also produces very light control forces,another undesirable characteristic.This makesit easy for the pilot to inadvertently over stress an aircraft  

# Stability and Center of Gravity  

Limitsfor thelocation of the CG are established by the manufacturer.These are the fore and aft limits beyond which the CG should not be located for flight.Theselimits are published for each aircraft in the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS),or aircraft specification and the AFM or pilot's operating handbook(POH). If theCGis not within the allowablelimitsafterloading,itwillbenecessarytorelocate some items before flight is attempted.  

The forward CG limit is often established at a location that is determined by the landing characteristics of an aircraft. Duringlanding,one of the most critical phases of flight. exceeding the forward CG limit may result in excessive loads on the nosewheel,a tendencytonose over on tailwheel type airplanes,decreased performance,higher stalling speeds,and higher control forces.  

# Control  

In extreme cases, a CG location that is beyond the forward limitmayresult innoseheaviness,making itdifficult or impossible to flare for landing.Manufacturers purposely place the forward CG limit as far rearward as possible to aid pilots in avoiding damage when landing. In addition to decreased static and dynamic longitudinal stability, other undesirable effects caused by a CG location aft of the allowable rangemay include extreme control difficulty, violent stall characteristics, and very light control forces whichmakeit easy to overstress an aircraft inadvertently  

A restricted forward CG limit is also specified to assure that sufficient elevator/control deflection is available at minimum airspeed.When structural limitations do not limit theforward CGposition,it islocated at the position where full-upelevator/control deflection isrequired to obtain a high AOAforlanding  

The af tCG limit is the most rearward position atwhichthe CG can be located for the most critical maneuver or operation As the CG moves aft,a less stable condition occurs,which decreases the ability of the aircraft to right itself after maneuvering or turbulence.  

For some aircraft,bothforeand aftCGlimits maybe specified to vary as gross weight changes.Theymay also be changed for certain operations, such as acrobatic flight. retraction of thelandinggear,or theinstallation of special loads and devices that change the flight characteristics.  

The actual location of the CG can be altered by many variable factors and is usually controlled by the pilot. Placement of baggage and cargo items determines the CG location.The assignment of seats to passengers can also be used as a means of obtaining a favorable balance. If an aircraft is tail heavy, it is only logical to place heavy passengers in forward seats. Fuel burn can also affect the CG based on the location of the fuel tanks. For example, most small aircraft carry fuel in the wings very near the CG and burning off fuel has little effect ontheloadedCG.  

# Management of Weight and Balance Control  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)part 23. section23.23 requires establishment of therangesof weights and CGs within which an aircraft maybe operated safely.The manufacturer provides thisinformation,whichis included in the approved AFM, TCDS, or aircraft specifications  

While there areno specified requirementsfor a pilot operating under 14 CFR part 91 to conduct weight and balance calculations prior to each flight,14CFRpart91,section 91.9 requires the pilot in command (PIC) to comply with the operating limits in the approved AFM. These limits include the weight and balance of the aircraft.To enable pilots to make weight and balance computations,charts and graphs areprovidedintheapprovedAFM.  

Weight and balance control should be a matter of concern to all pilots. The pilot controls loading and fuel management (the two variable factors that can change both total weight and CG location) of a particular aircraft. The aircraft owner or operator should make certain that up-to-dateinformation is available for pilot use, and should ensure that appropriate entries are made in the records whenrepairs or modifications have been accomplished.The removal or addition of equipment results in changes tothe CG  

Weight changes must be accounted for and the proper notations made in weight and balance records.The equipmentlist must beupdated,if appropriate.Withoutsuch information,the pilot has no foundation upon which to base the necessary calculations and decisions.  

Standard parts with negligible weight or the addition of minor items of equipment such as nuts,bolts,washers,rivets,and similar standard parts of negligible weight on fixed-wing aircraft do not require a weight and balance check. The following criteria for negligible weight change is outlined in Advisory Circular(AC)43.13-1(asrevised),Methods Techniques and Practices Aircraft Inspection and Repair:  

One pound or less for an aircraft whose weight empty islessthan5,000pounds Two pounds or less for aircraft with an empty weight of more than 5,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds Five pounds or less for aircraft with an empty weight of morethan50,000pounds  

Negligible CG change is any change ofless than 0.05 percent Mean Aerodynamic Chord(MAC)forfixed-wing aircraft or 0.2 percent for rotary wing aircraft.MAC is the average distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing.Exceeding these limits would require a weight and balancecheck.  

Before any flight,the pilot should determine the weight and balance condition of the aircraft.Simple and orderly proceduresbased on sound principles have been devised by the manufacturer for the determination of loading conditions.The pilot uses these procedures and exercises good judgment when determining weight and balance. In many modern aircraft, it is not possible to fill all seats, baggage compartments,and fuel tanks, and still remain within the approved weight and balance limits. If the maximum passenger load is carried, the pilot must often reduce the fuel load or reduce the amount of baggage.  

14 CFR part 125 requires aircraft with 20 or more seats or maximum payload capacity of 6,ooopoundsor more to be weighed every 36 calendar months.Multi-engine aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 135 are also required tobeweighedevery36months.Aircraftoperatedunder14 CFR part 135 are exempt from the 36 month requirement if operated under a weight and balance system approved in the operations specifications of the certificate holder.For additional information on approved weight and balance control programs for operations under parts 121 and 135, reference the currentedition of AC 120-27,AircraftWeight and Balance Control. AC 43.13-1,Acceptable Methods, Techniques and Practices Aircraft Inspection and Repair alsorequires that the aircraft mechanic ensure that the weight and balance data in the aircraft records is current and accurate after a1oo-hour or annual inspection.  

# Terms and Definitions  

The pilot should be familiar with the appropriate terms regarding weight and balance.The following list of terms and their definitions is standardized,and knowledge of these terms aids the pilot to better understand weight and balance calculationsofanyaircraft.TermsdefinedbytheGeneral Aviation Manufacturers Association(GAMA)asindustry standard are marked in the titles with GAMA.  

Arm(momentarm)the horizontal distance in inches from the reference datum line to the CG of an item. The algebraic sign is plus  $(+)$  if measured aft of the datumandminus  $(-)$  if measured forward of the datum. Basic empty weight (GAMA)—the standard empty weight plus theweight of optionaland special equipment that have been installed. Center of gravity (CG)—the point about which an aircraft would balance if it were possible to suspend it at that point. It is the mass center of the aircraft or the theoretical point atwhich the entireweight of the aircraft is assumed to be concentrated. It may be expressed in inches from the reference datum or in percent of MAC. The CGis a three-dimensional point with longitudinal. lateral, and vertical positioning in the aircraft.  

CG limits——-the specified forward and aft points within which the CG must be located during flight. These limits are indicated on pertinent aircraft specifications. CG range——the distance between the forward and aft CG limits indicated on pertinent aircraft specifications. Datum (reference datum)—an imaginary vertical plane or line from which all measurements of arm are taken. The datum is established by the manufacturer. Once the datum has been selected, all moment arms and the location of CG range are measured from this point.  $\triangle$  Delta-a Greek letter expressed by the symbol to indicate a change of values. As an example,  $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$  indicates a change (or movement) of the CG. Floor load limit—the maximum weight the floor can sustain per square inch/foot as provided by the manufacturer.  Fuel load—the expendable part of the load of the aircraft. It includes only usable fuel, not fuel required to fill the lines or that which remains trapped in the tank sumps. Licensed empty weight—the empty weight that consists of the airframe, engine(s), unusable fuel, and undrainable oil plus standard and optional equipment  as specified in the equipment list. Some manufacturers used this term prior to GAMA standardization. Maximum landing weight—the greatest weight that  an aircraft is normally allowed to have at landing. Maximum ramp weight—the total weight of a loaded aircraft including all fuel. It is greater than the takeoff weight due to the fuel that will be burned during the taxi and run-up operations. Ramp weight may also be referred to as taxi weight. Maximum takeoff weightthe maximum allowable weight for takeoff. Maximum weightthe maximum authorized weight of the aircraft and all of its equipment as specified in the TCDS for the aircraft. Maximum zero fuel weight (GAMA)—the maximum weight, exclusive of usable fuel. Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC)—the average distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the wing. Moment—the product of the weight of an item multiplied by its arm. Moments are expressed in pound-inches (in-lb). Total moment is the weight of the airplane multiplied by the distance between the datum and the CG.  

Moment index (or index)—a moment divided by a constant such as 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The purpose of using a moment index is to simplify weight and balance computations of aircraft where heavy items and long arms result in large, unmanageable numbers. Payload (GAMA)—the weight of occupants, cargo, and baggage. Standard empty weight (GAMA)—aircraft weight that consists of the airframe, engines, and all items of operating equipment thathavefixed locations and are permanently installed in the aircraft, including fixed ballast, hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full engine oil. Standard weights-—-established weights for numerous items involved in weight and balance computations These weights should not be used if actual weights are available. Some of the standard weights are: Gasoline. ... 6 Ib/US gal Jet A, Jet A-1.. ....6.8 Ib/US gal Jet B.... ...6.5 Ib/US gal Oil... ...7.5 Ib/US gal Water... .. 8.35 Ib/US gal Station—a location in the aircraft that is identified by a number designating its distance in inches from the datum. The datum is, therefore, identified as station zero.An item located at station  $+50$  would have an arm of 50 inches. Useful load—the weight of the pilot, copilot, passengers,baggage,usable fuel,and drainable oil. It is the basic empty weight subtracted from the maximum allowable gross weight. This term applies to general aviation (GA) aircraft only.  

# Principles of Weight and Balance Computations  

It is imperative that all pilots understand the basic principles of weight and balance determination. Thefollowing methods of computation can be applied to any object or vehicle for whichweight and balance information is essential.  

By determining the weight of the empty aircraft and adding the weight of everything loaded on the aircraft,atotalweight can be determined—a simple concept. A greater problem, particularly if the basic principles of weight and balance are notunderstood,is distributing this weight in such a manner that the entire mass of the loaded aircraft is balanced around a point (CG) that must be located within specified limits.  

The point at which an aircraft balances can be determined by locating the CG, which is, as stated in the definitions of terms, the imaginary point at which all the weight is concentrated. Toprovide the necessary balance between longitudinal stability and elevator control,the CGi s usually located slightlyforwardofthecenteroflift.Thisloadingcondition causesanose-down tendency in flight,which is desirable during flight at a high AO A and slow speeds.  

As mentioned earlier,a safe zone within which the balance point(CG)must fall is called the C Grange.Theextremities of the range are called the forward CG limits and af tCG limits. These limits are usually specified in inches, along the longitudinal axis of the airplane, measured from a reference point called a datum reference. The datum is an arbitrary point,established by aircraft designers that may vary in locationbetween different aircraft.[Figure10-2]  

The distance from the datum to any component part or any object loaded on the aircraft is called the arm.When the objector component is located aft ofthe datum,it ismeasured in positive inches; if located forward of the datum, it is measured as negative inches or minus inches.Thelocation of the object or part is often referred to as the station. If the weight of any object or component is multiplied by the distance from the datum (arm), the product is the moment. The moment is the measurement of the gravitational force that causes a tendency of the weight to rotate about a point or axis and is expressed ininch-pounds (in-lb).  

Toillustrate,assume a weight of 50 pounds is placed on the board at a station or point 1o0 inches from the datum. The downward force of the weight can be determined by multiplying 50 pounds by 100 inches, which produces a momentof5,000in-lb.[Figure10-3]  

To establish a balance,atotal of 5,000in-lbmustbe applied to theother endof theboard.Anycombination ofweight and distance which, when multiplied, produces a 5,oo0 in- lb moment will balance theboard.For example(illustrated  

![](images/64feecf93deeedfcfe9de2158d64ccd059917db37abdf9b022dbb63995332c50.jpg)

Figure10-3.Determining moment.  

in Figure 10-4), if a 100-pound weight is placed at a point (station) 25 inches from the datum, and another 50-pound weightisplaced at apoint(station)50 inches from the datum, the sum of the product of the two weights and their distances total a moment of 5,oo0 in-lb, which will balance the board.  

# Weight and Balance Restrictions  

Anaircraft's weight and balance restrictions should be closelyfollowed.The loading conditions andemptyweight of a particular aircraft may differ from that found in the AFM/POH because modifications or equipment changes may havebeen made.Sampleloading problems in the AFM/POH are intended for guidance only;therefore,each aircraft must be treated separately. Although an aircraft is certified for a specified maximum gross takeoff weight, it may not safely takeoff at this weight under all conditions. Conditions that affecttakeoff and climb performance,suchas high elevations, high temperatures, and high humidity (high density altitudes), may require a reduction in weight before flight is attempted. Other factors to consider when computing  

![](images/43c5e71e9eef4d3ccf010de30c037f0bf05e61d72397ed7b39f23d188d9d4146.jpg)  
Figure10-4.Establishing a balance  

weight and balance distribution prior totakeoff arerunway length, runway surface, runway slope, surface wind, and the presence of obstacles.These factors may require areduction in or redistribution of weight prior to flight  

Some aircraft are designed so that it is difficult to load them in a manner that places the C Gout of limits.Theseare usually small aircraft with the seats,fuel,andbaggageareas located near the CG limit.Pilots must be aware that while within CG limits these aircraft can be overloaded in weight Other aircraft canbeloaded in such a manner that they will beoutof CG limits eventhough the useful load has not been exceeded.Becauseoftheeffectsofanout-of-balanceor overweight condition,a pilot should always be sure that an aircraft is properly loaded.  

# Determining Loaded Weight and CG  

There are various methods for determining the loaded weight and CG of an aircraft.There is the computational method as well as methods that utilize graphs and tables provided by the aircraft manufacturer.  

# Computational Method  

The following is an example of the computational method involving the application of basic mathfunctions.  

Aircraft Allowances:  

Maximum gross weight .3,400pounds CGrange. .78-86 inches  

Given:  

Weight of front seat occupants..... .340 pounds Weight of rear seat occupants....350 pounds Fuel... ...75 gallons Weight of baggage in area 1. .80 pounds List the weight of the aircraft, occupants, fuel, and baggage. Remember that aviation gas (AVGAS) weighs 6 pounds per gallon and is used in this example. 2 Enter the moment for each item listed.Remember "weight x arm  $=$  moment." 3. Find the total weight and total moment. 4. To determine the CG,divide the total moment by the total weight.  

NOTE:The weight and balance records for a particular aircraft provide the empty weight and moment, as well as the information on the arm distance.[Figure1o-5]  

The total loaded weight of 3,320 pounds does not exceed the maximum gross weight of 3,400pounds, and the CG of  

![Figure10-5.Example of weight and balance computations. ](images/95f8b82590014cba11280f7109e288af60b75f40c0b6294e1c4c3b6b4dc602a7.jpg)  

84.8is within the 78-86inch range;therefore,the aircraft is loaded within limits.  

# Graph Method  

Another method for determining theloaded weight and CGis the use of graphs provided by the manufacturers. To simplify calculations, the moment may sometimes be divided by 100. 1,000, or 10,000. [Figures 10-6, 10-7, and 10-8]  

Front seat occupants.. .340 pounds Rear seat occupants .300pounds Fuel. ..40gallons Baggage area 1 .20pounds  

The same steps should be followed in the graph method as were used in the computational method except the graphs providedwillcalculatethemomentsandallowthepilotto determine if the aircraft is loaded within limits. To determine the moment using the loading graph, find the weight and draw a line straight across until it intercepts the item for which the moment is to be calculated. Then draw a line straight down to determine the moment. (The red line on the loading graph inFigure1o-7 represents the moment for the pilot and front passenger.All other moments were determined the same

way.)Once this has been done for each item,total theweight and moments and draw a line for both weight and moment on theCG envelopegraph.If the lines intersect within the envelope,the aircraft is loaded withinlimits.In this sample loadingproblem,the aircraft isloadedwithinlimits.  

# Table Method  

The table method applies the same principles as the computational and graph methods.Theinformation and limitations arecontained in tables provided by the manufacturer. Figure 1o-9 is an example of a table and a  

![](images/8d7ce45a3cd4849f398e83dcc843d07e12070a4ff08ef252f4a5234f47bcde89.jpg)

weight and balance calculation based on that table.In this problem,thetotalweight of 2,799pounds and moment of 2,278/100 are within the limits of the table.  

# Computations With a Negative Arm  

Figure10-10is a sampleofweight and balance computation using an aircraft with a negative arm.Itisimportant to remember that a positive times a negative equals a negative. and a negative would be subtracted from the total moments.  

# Computations With Zero Fuel Weight  

Figure1o-11 is a sample of weight and balance computation using an aircraft with a zero fuel weight.Inthisexample the total weight of the aircraft less fuel is 4,240pounds. which is under the zero fuel weight of 4,400 pounds. If the total weight of the aircraft without fuel had exceeded 4,400 pounds,passengers orcargowould have needed tobe reduced tobring theweight ator below the max zero fuel weight  

# Shifting, Adding, and Removing Weight  

A pilot must be able to solve any problems accurately that involvetheshift,addition,or removal of weight.Forexample thepilotmayload the aircraftwithin the allowable takeoff weight limit, then find that the CG limit has been exceeded. The most satisfactory solution to this problem is to shift baggage, passengers, or both. The pilot should be able to determine the minimum load shift needed to make the aircraft safefor flight.Pilots should be able todetermine if shifting a load to a new location will correct an out-of-limitcondition. There are some standardized calculations that canhelpmake these determinations.  

# Weight Shifting  

Whenweightisshiftedfromonelocationtoanother,the total weight of the aircraft is unchanged.Thetotalmoments, however,do change in relation and proportion to the direction and distance theweightis moved.Whenweight is movedforward,the total moments decrease;whenweight ismovedaft,total moments increase.Themomentchange is proportional tothe amount of weight moved.Sincemany  

![Figure10-1o.Sample weight and balance using a negative ](images/326a2ce2bc022f0872505c3d24680d150472924300445155a0808c2ff40e0321.jpg)

aircraft have forward and aft baggage compartments,weight maybe shifted from one to the other to change the CG.If starting with a known aircraft weight, CG, and total moments, calculatethenew CG (after theweightshift)by dividing the new total momentsby the total aircraftweight.  

To determine the new total moments, find out how many moments are gained or lostwhen theweight is shifted. Assume that 100 pounds has been shifted from station 30 to station 150. This movement increases the total moments of the aircraft by 12,000 in-lb.  

Moment when at station 150  $\mathrm{\Omega}=100\;\mathrm{lb}\times150\;\mathrm{in}=15{,}000\;\mathrm{in}{.}$  -1b  

Moment when  

at station30  $=100\;\mathrm{lb}\times30\;\mathrm{in}=3{,}000\;\mathrm{in-l}$  

Moment change  $=[15,\!000-3,\!000]=12{,}000{\mathrm{~in}}{\cdot}{\mathrm{l}}$  

By adding the moment change to the original moment (or subtracting if the weight has been moved forward instead of aft), the new total moments are obtained. Then determine the new CG by dividing the new moments by the total weight:  

$$
\mathrm{CG}=\frac{628{,}000\;\mathrm{in}{\cdot}\mathrm{lb}}{8{,}000\;\mathrm{lb}}{\;}=78.5\;\mathrm{in}
$$  

The shift has caused theCG to shift to station 78.5

A simpler solutionmaybe obtainedbyusing a computer or calculator and a proportional formula.This canbe done because the CG will shift a distance that is proportional to the distance the weight is shifted  

# Weight Addition or Removal  

In many instances, the weight and balance of the aircraft will be changed by the addition or removal of weight. When this happens, a new CG must be calculated and checked against the limitations to see if the location is acceptable. This type of weight and balanceproblem is commonly encountered when the aircraft burns fuel in flight, thereby reducing the weight located at the fuel tanks.Most small aircraft are designed with the fuel tanks positioned close to the CG; therefore, the consumption of fuel does not affect the CG to anygreatextent.  

The addition or removal of cargo presents a CG change problem that must be calculated before flight. The problem may alwaysbe solved by calculations involving total moments. A typical problem may involve the calculation of a new CG for an aircraft which, when loaded and ready for flight, receives some additional cargo or passengers just before departure time.  

![](images/e0c3bb40cc0d43514f264bc1d4bc016fa0bf87c68fe76a456b5d9959bf7a4c6b.jpg)  

In the previous examples,the  $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$  iseither addedor subtracted from the old CG. Deciding which to accomplish is besthandled by mentally calculating which way the CG will shift for the particular weight change. If the CG is shifting aft,the  $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$  is added to the old CG; if the CG is shifting forward,the  $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$  is subtracted from the old CG

# Aircraft  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses the factors that affect aircraft performance, which include the aircraft weight, atmospheric conditions, runway environment, and the fundamental physical laws governing the forces acting on an aircraft.  

# Importance of Performance Data  

The performance or operational information section of the Aircraft Flight Manual/Pilot's Operating Handbook (AFM/ POH) contains the operating data for the aircraft; that is, the data pertaining to takeoff, climb, range, endurance, descent, and landing. The use of this data in flying operations is mandatory for safe and efficient operation. Considerable knowledge and familiarity of the aircraft can be gained by studying this material.  

![](images/17a905f461aaaace285ba13d516da48bb8b3be12aa6084196d41529e824ecd57.jpg)  

It must be emphasized that the manufacturers’information and data furnished in the AFM/PO His not standardized. Someprovidethedataintabularform,whileothersuse graphs. In addition, the performance data may be presented on the basis of standard atmospheric conditions, pressure altitude, or density altitude. The performance information in theAFM/POH has little or no value unless the user recognizes those variations and makes the necessary adjustments.  

To be able to make practical use of the aircraft'scapabilities andlimitations,itisessential tounderstand thesignificance of the operational data.The pilot must be cognizant of the basis for the performance data, as well as the meanings of the various terms used in expressing performance capabilities andlimitations.  

Since the characteristics of the atmosphere have a majon effect on performance,it is necessary to review two dominant factors——pressure and temperature.  

# Structure of theAtmosphere  

The atmosphere is an envelope of air that surrounds the Earth and rests upon its surface.It is as much a part of the Earth as is land and water. However, air differs from land and water in that it is a mixture of gases. It has mass, weight. andindefiniteshape.  

Air, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its shape when subjected to even minute pressures because of the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example, gas will completelyfill any container into which itis placed,expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to the limits of the container.  

The atmosphere is composedof 78 percentnitrogen,21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as argon or helium.Most of the oxygen is contained below 35,000 feetaltitude.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

Though there are various kinds of pressure, pilots are mainly concerned with atmospheric pressure. It is one of the basic factors in weather changes, helps to lift the aircraft, and actuates some of the most important flight instruments in the aircraft.These instruments often include the altimeter,the airspeed indicator (ASI), the vertical speed indicator (VsI), and the manifold pressure gauge.  

Thoughair isverylight, ithasmass and is affectedbythe attraction of gravity.Therefore,like any other substance,it has weight;because it has weight,it has force. Since it is a fluid substance, this force is exerted equally in all directions, and its effect on bodies within the air is called pressure. Under standard conditions at sea level,the average pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphereis approximately14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). The density of air has significant effectsonthe aircraft'sperformance.As air becomes less dense,itreduces:  

Power, because the engine takes in less air Thrust, because the propeller is less efficient in thin air Lift,becausethethin air exerts less force on the airfoils  

The pressure of the atmosphere may vary with time but more importantly, it varies with altitude and temperature. Due to the changing atmospheric pressure, a standard reference was developed.The standard atmosphere at sea level has a surface temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  0r15 degreesCelsius  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and a surface pressure of 29.92inches ofmercury  $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  or 1013.2 millibars (mb).[Figure 11-1]  

A standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the temperature decreases at the rate of approximately  $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Or  $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  per thousand feet up to 36,000 feet. Above this point, the temperature is considered constant up to 80,o00feet.A standard pressure lapse rate is onein which pressure decreases ata rateof approximately1"Hg per1,000feet of altitudegain to10,000feet.[Figure11-2]The International Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO)has established this as a worldwide standard,and it is often referred to as International Standard Atmosphere(ISA) or ICAO Standard Atmosphere.Any temperature or pressure that differs from the standard lapse ratesis considered nonstandard temperature andpressure. Adjustments for nonstandard temperatures and pressures are provided on the manufacturer's performance charts.

Since all aircraft performance is compared and evaluated using the standard atmosphere,all aircraft instruments are calibrated for the standard atmosphere.Thus,certain corrections must apply to the instrumentation,aswellasthe aircraft performance, if the actual operating conditions do not fit the standard atmosphere.In order to account properly for the nonstandard atmosphere,certain related terms must bedefined.  

# Pressure Altitude  

Pressurealtitudeistheheightabovethestandarddatum plane(SDP).The aircraft altimeter is essentially asensitive barometercalibratedtoindicatealtitudeinthestandard atmosphere.If the altimeter is set for  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  SDP,the altitude indicated is the pressure altitude—the altitude in the standard atmosphere corresponding to the sensed pressure.  

TheSDPis a theoretical level atwhich the pressure of the atmosphereis  $29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}$  and theweight of airis14.7psi.As atmospheric pressure changes, the SDP may be below, at, or abovesealevel.Pressure altitude is important as a basis for determining aircraft performance, as well as for assigning flight levels to aircraft operating at above 18,000 feet.  

The pressure altitude can be determined by any of the three following methods:  

1。 By setting the barometric scale of the altimeter to  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  and reading the indicated altitude,  

2. By applying a correction factor to the indicated altitude according to the reported “altimeter setting, [Figure11-3]  

3. By using a flight computer  

# DensityAltitude  

Themoreappropriatetermforcorrelatingaerodynamic performance in the nonstandard atmosphere is density altitude—the altitude in the standard atmosphere corresponding to a particular value of air density.  

Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature.Asthedensityof theairincreases(lower density altitude),aircraft performance increases.Conversely  

![](images/4eaa914f3ee41dd760bb916104a7ac23103d73db78c378e1c69e226f363db8fe.jpg)  
Figure11-3.Field elevation versus pressure.The aircraft is located on a field that happens to beat sea level.Set the altimeter to the current altimeter setting(29.7).The difference of 205 feet is added to the elevation or aPA of 205 feet.  

as air density decreases (higher density altitude), aircraft performance decreases. A decrease in air density means a high density altitude; an increase in air density means a lower density altitude. Density altitude is used in calculating aircraft performance. Under standard atmospheric condition, air at each level in the atmosphere has a specific density; under standard conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude identify the same level. Density altitude, then, is the vertical distance above sea levelin thestandard atmosphere at which agiven density istobefound.  

Density altitude is computed using pressure altitude and temperature.Since aircraft performance data at any level is based upon air density under standard day conditions,such performance data applyto air density levels that maynot be identical to altimeter indications. Under conditions higher or lower than standard,these levels cannot be determined directly from the altimeter.  

Density altitude is determined by first finding pressure altitude and then correcting this altitude for nonstandard temperature variations.Since density varies directly with pressure,and inversely with temperature,a givenpressure altitude may exist for a wide range of temperature by allowing the density to vary. However, a known density occurs for anyone temperature and pressure altitude.Thedensityofthe air, of course, has a pronounced effect on aircraft and engine performance.Regardless of the actual altitude at which the aircraft is operating, it will perform as though it were operating at an altitude equal to the existing density altitude.  

For example,when set at  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  ,thealtimetermay indicate a pressure altitude of 5,o00feet.According to the AFM/POH, the ground run on takeoff may require a distance of 790feet understandard temperature conditions.However, ifthetemperatureis  $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  abovestandard,theexpansionof air raises the density level. Using temperature correction data from tables or graphs, or by deriving the density altitude with acomputer,it maybe found that the density level is above 7,000 feet, and the ground run may be closer to 1,000 feet.  

Air density is affected by changes in altitude, temperature and humidity. High density altitude refers to thin air while low density altitude refers to dense air. The conditions that result in a high density altitude are high elevations,low atmospheric pressures,high temperatures,highhumidity,or some combination of these factors. Lower elevations,high atmospheric pressure, low temperatures, and low humidity are more indicative of low density altitude.  

Using a flight computer, density altitude canbe computed by inputting thepressure altitude and outside air temperature at flightlevel.Density altitudecan also be determined byreferring to the table and chart in Figures 11-3and11-4respectively.  

# Effects of Pressure on Density  

Since airis agas,it canbe compressed orexpanded.When air is compressed,a greater amount of air can occupy a given volume. Conversely, when pressure on a given volume of air is decreased, the air expands and occupies a greater space. That is, the original column of air at a lower pressure  

![](images/2836c7b7c69741d8b3a94ad34018c64ebefbe85c6b8b2cdb3eeeb06f0ce1deec.jpg)  
Figure11-4.Density altitude chart  

contains a smaller mass of air. In other words, the density is decreased. In fact, density is directly proportional to pressure. If the pressure is doubled, the density is doubled, and if the pressure is lowered, so is the density. This statement is true only at a constant temperature.  

# Effects ofTemperature onDensity  

Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its density.Conversely,decreasing the temperature increases thedensity.Thus,thedensityof airvariesinverselywith temperature. This statement is true only at a constant pressure.  

Intheatmosphere,both temperature and pressure decrease with altitude and have conflicting effects upon density However, the fairly rapid drop in pressure as altitude is increased usually has the dominant effect. Hence, pilots can expect the density to decrease with altitude.  

# Effects of Humidity (Moisture) on Density  

The preceding paragraphs are based on the presupposition of perfectly dry air. In reality, it is never completely dry. The small amount of water vapor suspended in the atmosphere may be negligible under certain conditions, but in other conditions humidity may become an important factor in the performance of an aircraft. Water vapor is lighter than air; consequently, moist air is lighter than dry air. Therefore, as the water content of the airincreases, the air becomes less dense, increasing density altitude and decreasing performance. It is lightest or least dense when, in a given set of conditions, it contains themaximum amount ofwatervapor  

Humidity,alsocalled relative humidity,referstothe amount ofwater vapor containedin the atmosphere andis expressed asa percentage of the maximum amount of water vapon the air canhold.This amountvaries with the temperature; warm air can hold more water vapor, while colder air can hold less.Perfectly dry air that contains no water vapor has a relative humidity of zero percent,while saturated air that cannot hold any more water vapor has a relative humidity of 1o0 percent. Humidity alone is usually not considered an essential factor in calculating density altitude and aircraft performance;however,it does contribute.  

The higher the temperature, the greater amount of water vapor that the air can hold.When comparing two separate air masses,the first warm and moist(both qualities making air lighter) and the second cold and dry (both qualities making it heavier), the first must be less dense than the second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity have a great influence on aircraft performance because of their effect upon density. Thereisnorule-of-thumborchartusedtocomputetheeffects of humidity on density altitude, but it must be taken into consideration. Expect a decrease in overall performance in high humidity conditions.  

# Performance  

Performance is a term used to describe the ability of an aircraft to accomplish certain things that make it useful for certain purposes. For example, the ability of an aircraft to land and takeoff in a very short distance is an important factor to the pilot who operates in and out of short,unimproved airfields. The ability to carry heavyloads,fly at high altitudes atfastspeeds,and/or travellong distances is essentialfor the performance of airline and executive type aircraft.  

The primary factors most affected by performance are the takeoff and landing distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload, range,speed,maneuverability,stability,andfueleconomy. Some of thesefactors are often directly opposed: for example high speed versus short landing distance, long range versus great payload, and high rate of climb versus fuel economy. It is the preeminence of one or more of these factors that dictates differences between aircraft and explains thehigh degree of specialization found in modern aircraft.  

The various items of aircraft performance result from the combination of aircraft and powerplant characteristics. The aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft generally define thepower andthrust requirements atvarious conditions of flight, while powerplant characteristics generally define the power and thrust available at various conditions of flight. The matching of the aerodynamic configuration with the powerplant is accomplished by the manufacturer to provide maximum performance at the specific design condition (e.g., range,endurance,and climb).  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

All of theprincipal components of flight performance involve steady-state flight conditions and equilibrium of the aircraft. For the aircraft to remain in steady, level flight, equilibrium must be obtained by a lift equal to the aircraft weight and a powerplant thrust equal to the aircraft drag. Thus, the aircraft drag defines the thrust required to maintain steady, level flight. As presented in Chapter 4, Aerodynamics of Flight, all parts of an aircraft contribute to the drag, either induced (from lifting surfaces) or parasite drag.  

While parasite drag predominates at high speed, induced drag predominates at low speed. [Figure 11-5] For example,if an aircraft in a steady flight condition at 1o0 knots is then accelerated to 200 knots, the parasite drag becomes four times as great, but the power required to overcome that drag is eight times the original value. Conversely, when the  

![](images/7d68a15b7670980a7f5bd17523875edf95dc1e2dd61144834a4890cfea5f8dc3.jpg)  
Figure11-5.Dragversusspeed  

aircraft is operated in steady, level flight at twice as great a speed, the induced drag is one-fourth the original value, and the power required to overcome that drag is only one-half the originalvalue.  

When an aircraft is in steady, level flight, the condition of equilibriummust prevail.The un accelerated condition of flightis achievedwiththe aircraft trimmed for lift equal to weight and the powerplant set for athrust toequalthe aircraft drag.  

Themaximum level flight speed for the aircraft is obtained when the power or thrust required equals the maximum power or thrust available from the powerplant. [Figure 11-6] The minimumlevel flight airspeed is notusually defined by thrust or power requirement since conditions ofstall orstability and control problems generally predominate.  

# Climb Performance  

If an aircraft is to move,fly, and perform,work must act upon it. Work involves force moving the aircraft. The aircraft acquires mechanical energy when it moves. Mechanical  

![](images/f46391c3aaeb5b93a5758f9cfcd20f32249c2b78f6ed675f162ad40bc0e8a9d0.jpg)  
Figure11-6.Power versus speed.  

energy comes in two forms: (1) Kinetic Energy (KE), the energy of speed; (2) Potential Energy (PE), the stored energy ofposition.  

Aircraft motion (KE) is described by its velocity (airspeed) Aircraft position(PE)is described by its height(altitude)) Both KE and PE are directly proportional to the object's mass.KE is directly proportional to the square of the object's velocity (airspeed).PEis directly proportional to the object's height(altitude).The formulas below summarize these energy relationships:  

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\mathrm{KE}=\mathrm{1}\gamma_{2}\times\mathrm{m}\times\mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{2}}\quad\quad}}&{{\mathrm{m}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{mass}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{velocity}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{PE}=\mathrm{m}\times\mathrm{g}\times\mathrm{h}\quad\quad}}&{{\mathrm{g}=\mathrm{gravity}\;\mathrm{field}\;\mathrm{strength}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{h}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{height}}}\end{array}
$$  

We sometimes use the terms “power" and “thrust" interchangeably when discussing climb performance. This erroneously implies the terms are synonymous. It is important to distinguish between these terms.Thrust is a force or pressure exerted on an object. Thrust is measured in pounds (lb)or newtons(N).Power,however,is ameasurementof the rate of performing work or transferring energy (KE and PE). Power is typically measured in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw). We can think of power as the motion (KE andPE)aforce(thrust)creates when exerted on an object over aperiod oftime.  

Positive climb performance occurs when an aircraft gains PE by increasing altitude. Twobasic factors, or a combination of the twofactors,contribute topositive climb performance inmostaircraft:  

1。. The aircraft climbs(gainsPE)using excesspower above that required to maintain level flight,or 2 The aircraft climbs by converting airspeed (KE)to altitude(PE).  

As an example of factor 1 above,an aircraft with an engine capable of producing 200 horsepower(at a given altitude) is using only 130 horsepower to maintain level flight at that altitude.This leaves 7 O horsepower available to climb.The pilotholds airspeed constant and increases power to perform theclimb  

As an example of factor 2,an aircraft is flying level at 120 knots. The pilot leaves the engine power setting constant but applies other control inputs to perform a climb.The climb. sometimes called a zoom climb, converts the airspeed (KE)  

to altitude(PE);the airspeed decreases to something less than120knots asthe altitude increases.  

There are twoprimary reasons to evaluate climb performance First, aircraft must climb over obstacles to avoid hitting them. Second, climbing to higher altitudes can provide better weather,fueleconomy,and otherbenefits.Maximum Angle of Climb (AOC),obtained at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  ,mayprovideclimb performance to ensure an aircraft will clear obstacles. Maximum Rate of Climb (ROC), obtained at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  provides climb performance to achieve the greatest altitudegain over time.Maximum ROC may not be sufficient to avoid obstacles in some situations,while maximum AOC may be sufficient to avoid the same obstacles.[Figure11-7]  

# Angle of Climb (AoC)  

AOC is a comparison of altitude gained relative to distance traveled. AOC is the inclination (angle) of the flight path. For maximum AOC performance, a pilot flies the aircraft at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  

![](images/c092dcd2d4ad50d902f92c531a3fb159a15bec914c4d2603281fc22534c6fa44.jpg)  
Figure11-7.Maximum angleofclimb  $(A O C)$  versus maximum rate ofclimb (ROC).  

so as to achieve maximum altitude increase with minimum horizontaltravelovertheground.Agooduseofmaximum AOC is when taking off from a short airfield surrounded by highobstacles,such as trees or power lines.Theobjectiveis toga insufficient altitude to clear the obstacle while traveling the least horizontal distance over the surface.  

One method to climb (have positive AOC performance) is to have excess thrust available. Essentially, the greater the force that pushes the aircraft upward, the steeper it can climb. Maximum AOC occurs at the airspeed and angle of attack (AOA)combination which allows the maximum excess thrust.The airspeed and AO A combination where excess thrust exists varies amongst aircraft types. As an example, Figure11-8 provides a comparison between jet andpropeller airplanes as to where maximum excess thrust(formaximum AOC)occurs.In a jet,maximum excess thrust normally occurs at the airspeed where the thrust required is at a minimum(approximately  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  0. In a propeller airplane, maximum excess thrust normally occurs atan airspeed below  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  and frequently just above stall speed.  

# Rate of Climb (ROC)  

ROC is a comparison of altitude gained relative to the time needed to reach that altitude.ROC is simply the vertical component of the aircraft's flight path velocity vector.For maximum ROC performance, a pilot flies the aircraft at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  so astoachieve amaximumgainin altitudeover agiven periodoftime.  

Maximum ROC expedites a climb to an assigned altitude. Thisgains the greatest vertical distance over a period of time.For example,in a maximum AOC profile,a certain aircraft takes 30 seconds to reach 1,000feetAGL,but coversonly3,0 o 0 feet over the ground.Bycomparison, using its maximum ROC profile, the same aircraft climbs

to1,500 feet in 30 seconds but covers 6,000 feet across the ground.Note that both ROC and AOC maximum climb profilesuse the aircraft's maximum throttle setting.Any differences between max ROC and maxAOC lie primarily in the velocity (airspeed) and AOA combination the aircraft manualspecifies.[Figure1l-7]  

ROC performance depends upon excess power. Since climbing is work and power is the rate of performingwork. a pilot can increase the climb rate by using any power not used to maintain level flight.Maximum ROC occur satan airspeed and AO A combination that produces the maximum excess power.Therefore,maximumROC for a typical jet airplane occurs at an airspeed greater than  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  and at an AOA less than  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}\,A O A}$   In contrast, maximum ROC for atypical propeller airplane occur satan airspeed and AO A combination closer to  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  [Figure11-9]  

# ClimbPerformanceFactors  

Sinceweight,altitude and configuration changes affect excess thrust and power, they also affect climb performance. Climb performance is directly dependent upon the ability to produce either excess thrust or excess power.Earlier in the bookitwasshownthatanincreaseinweight,anincreasein altitude, lowering the landing gear, or lowering the flaps all decrease both excess thrust and excess powerfor all aircraft. Therefore,maximum AOC and maximum ROC performance decreases under any of these conditions.  

Weight has a very pronounced effect on aircraft performance. If weightis added toan aircraft,it mustfly at ahigherAOA to maintain a given altitude and speed.This increases the induced drag of the wings, as well as the parasite drag of the aircraft.Increased drag means that additional thrust is needed toovercomeit,which in turn means that less reserve thrust is available for climbing.Aircraft designers goto great lengths to minimize the weight, since it has such a marked effect on the factors pertaining to performance.  

A change in an aircraft's weight produces a twofold effect on climb performance.First,a change in weight changes the drag and the power required.This alters the reserve power available,whichinturn,affectsboththe climbangleand the climb rate. Secondly, an increase in weight reduces the maximumROC,but the aircraft must be operated atahigher climb speed to achieve the smaller peak climb rate.  

An increase in altitude also increases the power required and decreases the power available.Therefore,theclimb performance of an aircraft diminishes with altitude.The speeds for maximum ROC, maximum AOC, and maximum and minimum level flight airspeeds vary with altitude. As altitude is increased, these various speeds finally converge at the absolute ceiling of the aircraft. At the absolute ceiling, there is no excess of power and only one speed allows steady, level flight. Consequently, the absolute ceiling of an aircraft produceszeroROC.The service ceiling is the altitude at which the aircraft is unable to climb at a rate greater than 100 feet per minute (fpm). Usually, these specific performance reference points are provided for the aircraft at a specific design configuration.[Figure1l-10]  

The terms “power loading,“wing loading,”“blade loading, and “disk loading" are commonly used in reference to performance. Power loading is expressed in pounds per horsepower and is obtained by dividing the total weight of the aircraft by the rated horsepower of the engine. It is a significant factor in an aircraft's takeoff and climb capabilities. Wing loading is expressed in pounds per square foot and is obtained by dividing the total weight of an airplane in pounds by the wing area (including ailerons) in square feet. It is the airplane's wing loading that determines the landing

# Range Performance  

The ability of an aircraft to convert fuel energy into flying distanceisoneofthemostimportantitemsof aircraft performance. In flying operations,theproblem of efficient range operation of an aircraft appears in two general forms:  

1.To extract the maximum flying distance from a given fuelload 2. Toflya specified distance witha minimum expenditure of fuel  

A common element for each of these operating problems is the specific range; that is, nautical miles (NM) of flying distance versus the amount of fuel consumed.Rangemust be clearly distinguished from the item of endurance. Range involves consideration of flying distance, while endurance involves consideration of flying time. Thus, it is appropriate to define aseparateterm,specificendurance.  

![](images/8f2350569fbb0e3b2b19f3363661b446ab92fbf0ef6e852cddc86863e682e801.jpg)  

Fuel flowcanbe defined in either pounds or gallons.If maximum endurance is desired,theflight conditionmust provide a minimum fuel flow.InFigure1l-llatpointA, the airspeed is low and fuel flow is high. This would occur during ground operations or when taking off and climbing. As airspeed is increased, power requirements decrease due to aerodynamic factors,and fuel flow decreases to point B. This is the point of maximum endurance. Beyond this point, increases in airspeed come at a cost.Airspeed increases require additional power and fuel flow increases with additionalpower.  

Cruise flight operations for maximum range should be conducted so that the aircraft obtains maximum specific range throughout the flight. The specific range can be defined by the following relationship  

![](images/b3163e0ec90624b6b9e1fd5d98613dde01208e2e7776ba3de5b10c9178f471ed.jpg)  
Figure11-11.Airspeed for maximum endurance.  

specific range  $=$  

# NM/hour pounds of fuel/hour  

specific range  $=$  

# specific range  $=$  

If maximum specific range is desired, the flight condition must provide a maximum of speed per fuel flow. While the peak value of specific range would provide maximum range operation,long-rangecruise operation is generally recommended at a slightly higher airspeed. Most long-range cruise operations are conducted at the flight condition that provides 99 percent of the absolute maximum specific range. The advantage of such operation is that one percent of range is traded for three to five percent higher cruise speed. Since the higher cruise speed has agreatnumberof advantages,the small sacrifice of range is a fair bargain. The values of specific range versus speed are affected by three principal variables:  

1. Aircraft gross weight  

2.Altitude 3. The external aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft.  

These are the source of range and endurance operating data included in the performance section of theAFM/POH  

Cruise control of an aircraft implies that the aircraft is operated to maintain the recommended long-rangecruise condition throughout the flight. Since fuel is consumed during cruise,the gross weight of the aircraft varies and optimum airspeed,altitude,andpower setting can alsovary.Cruise control means the control of the optimum airspeed, altitude, and power setting tomaintain the 99 percent maximum specific range condition.At the beginning of cruiseflight,the relatively high initial weight of the aircraft requires specific values of airspeed, altitude, and power setting to produce the recommended cruise condition.As fuel is consumed and the aircraft's gross weight decreases,theoptimum airspeed and power setting may decrease, or the optimum altitude may increase. In addition, the optimum specific range increases. Therefore, the pilot must provide the proper cruise control procedure to ensure that optimum conditions are maintained.  

Total rangeis dependent onbothfuel available and specific range. When range and economy of operation are the principal goals,the pilot must ensure that the aircraft is operated at the recommendedlong-range cruise condition. By this procedure. the aircraft is capable of its maximum design-operating radius or can achieve flight distances less than the maximum with a maximum offuel reserve at thedestination.  

A propeller-driven aircraft combines the propeller with the reciprocating engine for propulsive power. Fuel flow is determined mainly by the shaft power put into the propeller rather than thrust. Thus, the fuel flow can be related directly to the power required to maintain the aircraft in steady,level flight, and on performance charts power can be substituted for fuel flow. This fact allows for the determination of range through analysis of power required versus speed.  

The maximum endurance condition would be obtained at the point of minimum powerrequired since thiswould require the lowest fuel flow to keep the airplane in steady, level flight Maximum range condition would occur where the ratio of speed to power required is greatest.[FigureIl-ll]  

The maximum range condition is obtained at maximum lift/ drag ratio  $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  , and it is important to note that for a given aircraft configuration, the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  occurs at a particular AOA and lift coefficient and is unaffected by weight or altitude.A variation in weight alters the values of airspeed and power required toobtain the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  ：[Figure11-12]Different theoriesexistonhowtoachievemaxrangewhenthereisa headwind or tailwind present. Many say that speeding up in a headwind or slowing down in a tail wind helps to achieve max range. While this theory may be true in a lot of cases, it is not always true as there are different variables to every situation. Each aircraft configuration is different, and there is not a rule of thumb that encompasses all of them as to how to achieve the max range.  

![](images/debf44bd349c4ff10912d5e0fe41660782a890fa145997436ac17d789ab6e48f.jpg)  
Figure 11-12. Effect of weight  

The variations of speed and power required must be monitored by the pilot as part of the cruise control procedure tomaintainthe  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  .When the aircraft's fuel weight is a small part of the gross weight and the aircraft's range is small, the cruise control procedure can be simplified to essentially maintaining aconstantspeed and power setting throughout the time of cruise flight. However, a long-range aircraft has a fuel weight that is a considerable part of the gross weight, and cruise control procedures must employ scheduled airspeed andpower changes tomaintain optimumrange conditions.  

The effect of altitude on the range of a propeller-driven aircraft is illustrated in Figure 11-13.A flight conducted at high altitude has a greater true airspeed(TAS),and thepower required is proportionately greater thanwhen conducted at sea level.Thedrag ofthe aircraft at altitude is thesame as the drag at sealevel,but thehigher TAS causes a proportionately greater power required.  

NOTE: The straight line that is tangent to the sea level power curve is also tangent to the altitude power curve.  

The effect of altitude on specific range can also be appreciated from the previous relationships. If a change in altitude causes identical changes in speed and power required, the proportion of speed to power required would be unchanged. The fact implies that the specific range of a propeller-driven aircraft would be unaffected by altitude.Actually,thisistruetothe extent that specific fuel consumption and propeller efficiency are theprincipal factors that could cause a variation of specific range with altitude. If compressibility effects are negligible, any variation of specific range with altitude is strictly a function of engine/propeller performance.  

An aircraft equipped with a reciprocating engine experiences very little,if any,variation of specific range up to its absolute altitude.Thereisnegligiblevariationofbrake  

![](images/a26a712f402deed1b6b0e384b42295253c9b30ffc534e818aa746f41c980e3ae.jpg)

specific fuel consumption for values of brake horsepower below the maximum cruise power rating of the engine that is the lean range of engine operation. Thus, an increase in altitude produces a decrease inspecific range only when the increased power requirement exceeds the maximum cruise power rating of the engine. One advantage of supercharging is that the cruise power may be maintained at high altitude. and the aircraft may achieve the range at high altitudewith the corresponding increase in TAs. The principal differences in the high altitude cruise and low altitude cruise are the T AS and climb fuel requirements.  

# Region ofReversed Command  

The aerodynamic properties of an aircraft generally determine thepower requirements at various conditions of flight, while thepowerplant capabilities generally determine thepower available at various conditions of flight.Whenanaircraft is in steady,level flight,a condition of equilibrium must prevail.An unaccelerated condition of flight is achieved whenlift equalsweight, and the powerplant is setfor thrust equal to drag. The power required to achieve equilibrium in constant-altitudeflight atvarious airspeedsis depicted on a power required curve.The power required curve illustrates the fact that at low airspeed s near the stall or minimum controllable airspeed, the power setting required for steady, level flight is quite high  

Flight in the region of normal command means thatwhile holding a constant altitude, a higher airspeed requires a higher power setting and a lower airspeed requires a lower power setting. The majority of aircraft flying (climb, cruise, and maneuvers)is conducted in the region of normal command.  

Flight in the region of reversed command means flight in which a higher airspeed requires alower power setting and a lower airspeed requires a higher power setting to holdaltitude.It does not imply that a decrease in power produces lower airspeed. The region of reversed commandis encountered in the low speed phases of flight. Flight speeds below the speed for maximum endurance (lowest point on the power curve) require higher power settings with a decreasein airspeed.Since the need to increase the required power setting with decreased speed is contrary to the normal command of flight, the regime of flight speeds between the speed for minimum required power setting and the stall speed (or minimum control speed) is termed the region of reversed command. In the region of reversed command, a decrease in airspeed must be accompanied by anincreased power setting in order tomaintain steadyflight  

Figure1l-14 shows themaximum power available as a curved line. Lower power settings, such as cruise power, would also appear in a similar curve. The lowest point on  

![](images/e99a24e135daba5a95b3ff42a8eeb813969843e4893ce2229005ef4c5ab3e587.jpg)  
Figure 11-14.Power required curve.  

the power required curve represents the speed at which the lowest brake horsepower sustainslevel flight. This is termed the best endurance airspeed.  

An airplane performing a low airspeed, high pitch attitude power approach for a short-field landing is an example of operating in the region of reversed command. If an unacceptably high sink rate should develop,it may be possiblefor the pilot to reduce or stop the descent by applying power. But without further use of power, the airplane would probably stall or be incapable of flaring for the landing. Merely lowering the nose of the airplane to regain flying speed in this situation,without the use of power,would result in a rapid sink rate and corresponding loss of altitude.  

If during a soft-field takeoff and climb, forexample, the pilot attempts to climb out of ground effect without first attaining normal climb pitch attitude and airspeed, the airplane may inadvertently enter the region of reversed command at a dangerously low altitude.Even with full power,theairplane may be incapable of climbing or even maintaining altitude. Thepilot's only recourse in this situation is to lower the pitch attitude in order toincrease airspeed,which inevitably results inalossof altitude.  

Airplane pilots must give particular attention to precise control of airspeedwhen operatingin thelowflight speeds of theregionof reversedcommand.  

# Takeoff and Landing Performance  

The majority of pilot-caused aircraft accidents occur during the takeoff and landing phase of flight.Because of thisfact, the pilot must be familiar with all the variables that influence the takeoff and landing performance of an aircraft and must strive for exacting,professional procedures of operation during these phases of flight  

Takeoff andlanding performance is a conditionof accelerated and decelerated motion.Forinstance,during takeoff an aircraft starts at zero speed and accelerates to the takeoff speed to become airborne.Duringlanding,the aircraft touches down at the landing speed and decelerates to zero speed. The important factors of takeoff or landing performanceare:  

The takeoff or landing speed is generally a function of the stall speed or minimum flying speed. The rate of acceleration/deceleration during the takeoff or landing roll. The speed (acceleration and deceleration)experiencedby any object varies directly with the imbalance of force and inversely with the massoftheobject.An airplane on the runway moving at 75 knots has four times the energy it has traveling at 37 knots. Thus,an airplane requires four times as much distance to stop as required at half the speed. The takeoff or landing roll distance is a function of both acceleration/deceleration andspeed.  

# Runway Surface and Gradient  

Runway conditions affecttakeoff and landing performance. Typically, performance chart information assumes paved, level,smooth,and dry runway surfaces.Since no two runways are alike,therunway surface differs from one runwaytoanother,as does the runway gradient or slope [Figure11-15]  

Runway surfacesvary widely from one airport to another. The runway surface encountered may be concrete, asphalt, gravel, dirt, or grass. The runway surface for a specific airport is noted in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory).Any surface that is not hard and smooth increases the ground roll during takeoff. This is due to the inability of the tires to roll smoothly along the runway. Tires can sink into soft, grassy, or muddy runways. Potholes or other ruts in thepavement canbe the cause of poor tire movement along the runway. Obstructions such as mud, snow, or standing water reduce the airplane's acceleration down the runway.Although muddy and wet surface conditions can reduce friction between the runway andthetires,they can also act as obstructions and reduce thelanding distance.[Figure11-16]Braking effectiveness is another consideration when dealing with various runway types. The condition of the surface affects the braking ability oftheaircraft.  

The amount of power that is applied tothebrakes without skidding the tires is referred to as braking effectiveness. Ensure that runways are adequate in length for takeoff acceleration and landing deceleration when less thanideal surface conditions are being reported.  

![](images/2e4ca2dc4b61afc3e7eb3c2471ada4369ae05c1e834314a0a7a399bac2976408.jpg)  
Figure11-15.Takeoff distance chart  

Thegradientorslopeof therunwayis theamountof change in runway height over the length of the runway. The gradient is expressed as a percentage, such as a 3 percent gradient.This means thatfor every1o0feet of runwaylength,the runway height changes by 3 feet. A positive gradient indicates the runway height increases,and a negative gradient indicates the runway decreases in height. An upsloping runway impedes acceleration and results in a longer ground run during takeoff. However, landing on an upsloping runway typically reduces thelandingroll.A down sloping runway aidsin acceleration on takeoff resulting in shorter takeoff distances. The opposite is true whenlanding,aslanding on a down sloping runway increases landing distances.Runway slope information is contained in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/ Facility Directory).[FigureIl-17]  

Water on theRunway and Dynamic Hydroplaning Water on the runways reduces the friction between the tires and the ground and can reduce braking effectiveness.The ability to brake can be completely lost when the tires are hydroplaning because a layer of water separates the tires from the runway surface.This is also true of braking effectiveness when runways are covered in ice.  

When the runway is wet, the pilot may be confronted with dynamic hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning is a condition inwhichtheaircrafttiresrideonathinsheetofwaterrather than on the runway's surface. Because hydroplaning wheels are not touching the runway, braking and directional control are almost nil. To help minimize dynamic hydroplaning. some runways are grooved to help drain off water; most runwaysarenot.

Figure11-17.Chart Supplement U.S.(formerlyAirport/Facility Directory)information  

Tire pressure is a factor in dynamic hydroplaning. Using the simple formula in Figure 11-18, a pilot can calculate the minimum speed, in knots, at which hydroplaning begins. In plain language, the minimum hydroplaning speed is determined by multiplying the square root of the main gear tire pressure in psi by nine. For example, if the main gear tire pressure is at 36 psi, the aircraft would begin hydroplaning at54knots.  

Landing at higher than recommended touchdown speeds exposes the aircraft to a greater potential for hydroplaning And once hydroplaning starts,it can continue well below the minimuminitial hydroplaning speed.  

On wet runways,directional control can be maximized by landing into the wind.Abrupt control inputs should be avoided.When the runway is wet, anticipate braking problems

# Takeoff Performance  

The minimum takeoff distance is of primary interest in the operation of any aircraft because it defines the runway requirements.The minimum takeoff distance is obtained by taking of fat some minimum safe speed that allows sufficient margin above stall and provides satisfactory control and initialROC.Generally,thelift-off speed is some fixed percentage of the stall speed or minimum control speed for the aircraft in the takeoff configuration.Assuch,thelift-offis accomplished at some particular value of lift coefficient and AOA. Depending on the aircraft characteristics, the lift-off speed is anywhere from 1.05 to 1.25 times the stall speed or minimum control speed.  

To obtain minimum takeoff distance at the specific lift-off speed, the forces that act on the aircraft must provide the maximum acceleration during the takeoff roll.Thevarious forces acting on the aircraft mayor may not be under the control of the pilot,and various procedures maybe necessary in certain aircraft to maintain takeoff acceleration at the highestvalue.  

The powerplant thrust is the principal force to provide the acceleration and,for minimum takeoff distance,the output thrust should be at a maximum. Lift and drag are produced as soon as the aircraft has speed, and the values of lift and drag depend on the AOA and dynamic pressure.  

As discussed in Chapter 6, engine pressure ratio (EPR)is the ratio between exhaust pressure(jetblast)andinlet(static) pressure on a turbo jet or turbo fan engine. An EPR gauge tells the pilot how much power the engines are generating. The higher the EPR, the higher the engine thrust. EPR is used to avoid over-boosting an engine and to set takeoff and go around power if needed. This information is important to know before taking off as it helps determine the performance oftheaircraft.  

In addition to the important factors of proper procedures, many other variables affect the takeoff performance of an aircraft.Anyitem that alters the takeoff speed or acceleration rate during the takeoff roll affects the takeoff distance.  

For example,theeffect ofgrossweight ontakeoff distance is significant, and proper consideration of this item must be made in predicting the aircraft'stakeoff distance.Increased gross weight can be considered to produce a threefold effect on takeoff performance:  

1。 Higher lift-off speed 2. Greatermasstoaccelerate 3. Increased retarding force (drag and ground friction)  

If thegross weight increases,a greater speed is necessary to produce the greater lift necessary to get the aircraft airborne at thetakeoffliftcoefficient.Asanexampleoftheeffectof a change in gross weight, a 21 percent increase in takeoff weight requires a 10percent increase in lift-off speed to support the greater weight  

A change in gross weight changes the net accelerating force and changes the mass thatis being accelerated.If the aircraft has a relatively high thrust-to-weight ratio, the change in the net accelerating force is slight and the principal effect on acceleration is due to the change in mass.  

For example,a 10percent increase in takeoff gross weigh wouldcause:  

A 5 percent increase in takeoff velocity Atleast a 9 percent decrease in rate of acceleration Atleasta21percentincreaseintakeoffdistance  

With ISA conditions, increasing the takeoff weight of the average Cessna 182from 2,400 pounds to2,700 pounds (11 percent increase) results in an increased takeoff distance from 440feet to575feet(23 percent increase).  

For the aircraft with a high thrust-to-weight ratio,theincrease in takeoff distance might be approximately 21 to 22 percent. but for the aircraft with a relatively low thrust-to-weight ratio,the increase in takeoff distance would be approximately 25to30percent.Such a powerful effect requires proper consideration of gross weight in predicting takeoff distance.  

Theeffectofwindontakeoffdistanceislarge,andproper consideration must also be provided when predicting takeoff distance.Theeffectof aheadwindistoallowtheaircraftto reachthelift-off speed at a lower ground speed,whilethe effectofatailwindistorequiretheaircrafttoachievea greater ground speed to attain thelift-offspeed.  

A headwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed reduces the takeoff distance approximately 19 percent. However, a tailwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed increases the takeoff distance approximately 21 percent.In the case where the headwind speed is 50 percent of the takeoff speed the takeoff distancewouldbe approximately 25percent of the zerowind takeoff distance (75 percent reduction).  

Theeffectofwindonlandingdistanceisidenticaltoits effect on takeoff distance.Figure11-19illustrates thegeneral effect of wind by the percent change in take of for landing distance as a function of the ratio of wind velocity to takeoff orlandingspeed.  

The effect of proper takeoff speed is especially important when runway lengths and takeoff distances are critical.The takeoff speedsspecified in theAFM/POH aregenerally the minimum safe speeds at which the aircraft can become airborne.Any attempt to takeoff below the recommended speed means that the aircraft could stall,bedifficultto control,or have a very low initial ROC.Insomecases,an  

![](images/eead61365ebf2e90ab0f60ba6f11ecd50f5c3ba3db71d0e3397383a227e7ae8d.jpg)  
Figure11-19.Effect ofwind ontakeoff and landing.  

excessive AO A may not allow the aircraft to climb out of groundeffect.Ontheotherhand,an excessive airspeed at takeoff may improve the initial ROC and "feel"' of the aircraft but produces an undesirable increase in takeoff distance. Assuming that the acceleration is essentially unaffected,the takeoff distance varies with the square of the takeoff velocity  

Thus,ten percent excess airspeed would increase the takeoff distance 21 percent.In most critical takeoff conditions,such an increase in takeoff distance would be prohibitive,andthe pilot must adhere to the recommended takeoff speeds  

The effect ofpressure altitude and ambient temperature is to define the density altitude and its effect on takeoff performance.While subsequent corrections are appropriate for the effect of temperature on certain items of powerplant performance,density altitude defines specific effects on takeoff performance.An increase in density altitude can produce a twofold effect on takeoff performance:  

1。 Greater takeoff speed 2. Decreased thrust and reduced net accelerating force  

If an aircraft of given weight and configuration is operated at greater heights above standard sealevel,the aircraft requires the same dynamic pressure to become airborne at the takeoff liftcoefficient.Thus,theaircraftataltitudetakesoffatthe same indicated airspeed(IAS)asatsealevel,butbecauseof the reduced air density,theTASisgreater.  

Theeffect of density altitude on powerplant thrustdepends much on the type of powerplant.An increase in altitude above standard sea level brings an immediate decrease in power output for the unsupercharged reciprocating engine. However, an increase in altitude above standard sealevel does not cause a decrease in power output for thesupercharged reciprocating engine until the altitude exceeds the critical operating altitude. For those powerplants that experience a decay in thrust with an increase in altitude,the effect on the net accelerating force and acceleration rate can be approximated by assuming a direct variation with density. Actually,this assumed variation would closely approximate the effect on aircraft with high thrust-to-weight ratios.  

Proper accounting of pressure altitude and temperature is mandatory for accurate prediction of takeoff roll distance. The most critical conditions of takeoff performance are the result of some combination of high gross weight, altitude, temperature, and unfavorable wind. In all cases, the pilot must make an accurate prediction of takeoff distance from the performance data of the AFM/POH, regardless of the runway available, and strive for a polished, professional takeoff procedure.  

In the prediction of takeoff distance from theAFM/POH data, the following primary considerations must be given:  

Pressure altitude and temperatureto define theeffect ofdensity altitude on distance Gross weight a large effect on distance Wind—a large effect due to the wind or wind component alongtherunway Runway slope and condition——the effect of an incline andretarding effect of factors such as snow or ice  

# Landing Performance  

Inmanycases,the landing distance of an aircraft defines the runway requirements for flight operations.Theminimum landing distance is obtained bylanding at some minimum safe speed,that allows sufficient margin above stall and provides satisfactory control and capability for a go-around. Generally, the landing speed is some fixed percentage of the stall speed or minimum control speed for the aircraft in the landing configuration. As such, the landing is accomplished at some particularvalueofliftcoefficient andAOA.Theexactvalues depend onthe aircraft characteristics but,oncedefined,the values are independent of weight, altitude, and wind.  

To obtain minimumlanding distance at the specified landing speed,the forces that act on the aircraft must provide maximum deceleration during the landing roll. The forces acting on the aircraft during thelanding roll may require various procedures to maintain landing deceleration at the peakvalue.  

A distinction should be made between the procedures for minimum landing distance and an ordinary landing roll with considerable excess runway available.Minimum landing distance is obtained by creating a continuous peak deceleration of the aircraft; that is, extensive use of the brakes for maximum deceleration. On the other hand, an ordinary landing roll with considerable excess runway may allow extensive use of aerodynamic drag to minimize wear and tear on the tires and brakes. If aerodynamic drag is sufficient to cause deceleration,it can be used in deference to the brakes in the early stages of the landing roll (i.e., brakes and tires suffer from continuous hard use, but aircraft aerodynamic drag is free and does not wear out with use). The use of aerodynamic drag is applicable onlyfor deceleration to 60 or 70 percent of the touchdown speed.At speeds less than 60 to 70 percent of the touchdown speed, aerodynamic drag is so slight as to be of little use, and braking must be utilized to produce continued deceleration.Since the objective during the landing roll is to decelerate, the powerplant thrust should be the smallest possible positive value (or largest possible negativevaluein the case of thrust reversers).  

In addition to the important factors of proper procedures, many other variables affect the landing performance.Any item that alters thelandingspeed or deceleration rate during thelanding roll affects thelanding distance.  

The effect of gross weight on landing distance is one of the principal items determining the landing distance. One effect of an increased gross weight is that a greater speed is required tosupport the aircraft at thelanding AOA and lift coefficient. For an example of the effect of a change in gross weight, a 21 percent increase in landing weight requires a ten percent increase in landing speed to support the greater weight  

When minimum landing distances are considered, braking friction forces predominate during the landing roll and, for the majority of aircraft configurations,braking friction is the main source of deceleration.  

The minimum landing distance varies indirect proportion to the gross weight. For example, a ten percent increase in grossweight at landingwould causea:  

Five percent increase in landing velocity Ten percent increase in landing distance  

A contingency of this is the relationship between weight and braking friction force.  

The effect of wind on landing distance is large and deserves proper consideration when predicting landing distance.Since the aircraft lands at a particular airspeed independent of the wind,the principal effect of wind on landing distance is the change in the groundspeed at which the aircraft touches down.Theeffectofwind on deceleration during the landing is identical to the effect on acceleration during the takeoff.  

The effect of pressure altitude and ambient temperature is to define density altitude and its effect on landing performance. An increase in density altitude increases thelanding speed but does not alter the net retarding force. Thus, the aircraft ataltitudelandsatthesameIASasatsealevelbut,because of the reduced density, the TAS is greater. Since the aircraft lands at altitude with the same weight and dynamic pressure, the drag and braking friction throughout thelanding roll have the same values as at sea level.As long as the condition is within the capability of the brakes,the net retarding force isunchanged,and the deceleration is the same as with the landing atsealevel.Since an increase in altitudedoesnot alter deceleration, the effect of density altitude on landing distanceisduetothegreaterTAS  

The minimum landing distance at 5,000 feet is 16 percent greater than the minimum landing distance at sea level. The approximateincreaseinlandingdistancewithaltitudeis approximately three andone-half percent for each 1,oo0feet of altitude.Proper accounting of density altitudeis necessary to accurately predict landing distance.  

The effect of properlanding speed is important when runway lengths and landing distances are critical.The landing speeds specified in theAFM/POH aregenerally theminimumsafe speeds at which the aircraft can be landed.Anyattemptto land at below the specified speed may mean that the aircraft maystall,be difficult to control,or develop high rates of descent. On the other hand, an excessive speed at landing may improve the controllability slightly(especiallyin crosswinds) but causes an undesirable increase inlanding distance.  

A ten percent excesslanding speed causes at least a 21 percent increase in landing distance. The excess speed places a greater working load on the brakes because of the additional kinetic energy to be dissipated.Also, the additional speed causes increased drag and lift in the normal ground attitude,and the increased lift reduces the normal force on the braking surfaces.The deceleration during this range of speed immediately after touchdown may suffer, and it is more probable for a tire to be blown out from braking at this point.  

The most critical conditions of landing performance are combinations of high gross weight,high density altitude and unfavorable wind.These conditions produce the greatest required landing distances and critical levels of energy dissipation on the brakes. In all cases, it is necessary to make an accurate prediction of minimum landing distance to compare with the available runway. A polished, professional landing procedure is necessary because the landing phase of flight accounts for more pilot-caused aircraft accidents than anyother single phase of flight.  

In the prediction of minimum landing distance from the AFM/POH data,the following considerations must be given:  

Pressure altitude and temperature to define theeffect of density altitude Gross weight—which defines the CAS for landing Wind—a large effect due to wind or wind component alongtherunway Runway slope and condition—relativelysmall correction for ordinary values of runway slope, but a significant effect of snow,ice,orsoftground  

A tail wind of ten knots increases the landing distance by about 21 percent. Anincrease oflanding speed by tenpercent increases the landing distance by 20 percent. Hydroplaning makes braking ineffective until a decrease of speed that can be determined by using Figure 1 l-18  

Forinstance,a pilot is downwind for runway 18,andthe tower asks if runway 27 could be accepted. There is a light rain and the winds are out of the east at ten knots. The pilot accepts because he or she is approachingthe extended centerline of runway 27.Theturn is tight and the pilot must descend (dive) to get to runway 27. After becoming aligned with the runway and at50feet AGL, thepilotis already1,000 feet down the 3,500 feet runway. The airspeed is still high by about ten percent (should be at 70 knots and is at about 80 knots). The wind of ten knots is blowing from behind.  

First,the airspeed being high by about tenpercent(80knots versus 70 knots), as presented in the performance chapter, results in a 20 percent increase in the landing distance. In performance planning, the pilot determined that at 70 knots the distance would be 1,600feet.However,nowit is increased by 20 percent and the required distance is now 1,920feet.  

The newly revised landing distance of 1,920feetisalso affected by the wind.In looking at Figure 11-19,theaffect of the wind is an additional 20 percent for every ten miles perhour(mph)inwind.Thisiscomputednotontheoriginal estimate but on the estimate based upon the increased airspeed. Now the landing distance is increased by another 320feet for a total requirement of 2,240 feet toland the airplane after reaching 50 feet AGL  

That is the original estimate of 1,600 under planned conditions plusthe additional 640 feet for excess speed and the tailwind. Given the pilot overshot the threshhold by 1,o00feet, the total length required is 3,240ona3,500footrunway;260 feet to spare.But this is in a perfect environment. Most pilots become fearful as the end of the runway is facing them just ahead. A typical pilot reaction is to brakeand brake hard. Because the aircraft does not have antilock braking features like a car, the brakes lock, and the aircraft hydroplanes on thewetsurfaceof the runway until decreasing to a speed of about 54 knots(the square root of the tire pressure  $(\sqrt{3}6)\ \times$  9). Braking is ineffective when hydroplaning.  

The 260 feet that a pilot might feel is left over has long since evaporated as the aircraft hydroplaned thefirst 300-500feet when the brakes locked. This is an example of a true story, but one which only changes from year to year because of new participants and aircraftwith different N-numbers.  

In this example,the pilot actually mademanybad decisions. Bad decisions, when combined, have a synergy greater than the individual errors. Therefore,the corrective actions become larger and larger until correction is almost impossible.Aeronautical decision-making is discussed more fully in Chapter 2,Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)  

# Performance Speeds  

True airspeed (TAS)—the speed of the aircraft in relation to the air mass in which it is flying.  

Indicated airspeed (IAS)—the speed of the aircraft as observed on the AS I.It is the airspeed without correction for indicator,position(orinstallation),or compressibility errors  

Calibrated airspeed (CAS)—the ASI reading corrected for position(or installation) and instrument errors.(CAS is equal to TAS at sea level in standard atmosphere.) The color coding for various design speeds marked onASIsmaybe IASorCAS.  

Equivalent airspeed(EAS)—the AS I reading corrected for position (or installation), for instrument error, and for adiabatic compressible flow for the particular altitude.(EAs is equal to CAS at sea level in standard atmosphere.)  

$\mathrm{V_{S0}}$  the calibrated power-off stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed at which the aircraft is controllablein the landing configuration.  

$\mathrm{V_{S1}}$  the calibrated power-off stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed at which the aircraft is controllable in a specified configuration.  

$\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  thespeed atwhich the aircraftobtains themaximum increase in altitude per unit of time. This best ROC speed normally decreases slightly with altitude  

$\mathrm{V_{X}}$  thespeed at which the aircraft obtains the highest altitude in a given horizontal distance.This best AOC speed normally increases slightly with altitude  

$\mathrm{V_{LE}}$  the maximum speed at which the aircraft can be safely flown with the landing gear extended. This is a problem involving stability and controllability.  

$\mathrm{V_{LO}}$  the maximum speed at which the landing gear can be safely extended or retracted. This is a problem involving the air loads imposed on the operating mechanism during extension or retraction of the gear.  

$\mathrm{V_{FE}}$  the highest speed permissible with the wing flaps in a prescribed extended position.This is because of the air loads imposed on the structure of the flaps.  

$\mathrm{V_{A}}$  the calibrated design maneuvering airspeed.This is the maximum speed at which the limit load can be imposed (either by gusts or full deflection of the control surfaces) without causing structural damage.Operating at orbelow maneuvering speed does not provide structural protection against multiple full control inputs in one axis or full control inputs in more than one axis at the same time.  

$\mathrm{V_{N0}}$  the maximum speed for normal operation or the maximum structural cruising speed.This is the speed at which exceeding the limit load factor may cause permanent deformation of the aircraft structure.  

$\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  the speed that should never be exceeded.If flight is attempted above this speed, structural damage or structural failure may result.  

# Performance Charts  

Performance charts allow a pilot to predict the takeoff,climb cruise, andlanding performance of an aircraft.These charts, provided by the manufacturer, areincluded in theAFM/POH. Informationthemanufacturerprovidesonthesechartshas been gathered from test flights conducted in a new aircraft, under normal operating conditions while using average piloting skills, and with the aircraft and engine in good workingorder.Engineers record the flight data and create performance charts based on the behavior of the aircraft during the test flights. By using these performance charts, a pilot can determine the runway length needed to takeoff and land, the amount of fuel to be used during flight, and the time required to arrive at the destination. It is important to remember that the data from the charts will not be accurate if the aircraft is not in good working order or when operating under adverse conditions.Always consider the necessity to compensate for the performance numbers if the aircraft is not in good working order or piloting skills are below average Each aircraft performs differently and, therefore,has different performance numbers.Compute the performance of the aircraft prior to every flight,as every flight is different.(See appendixfor examples of performance charts for a Cessna Model172RandChallenger605.)  

Every chart is based on certain conditions and contains notes on how to adapt the information for flight conditions. It is important to read every chart and understand how to use it. Read the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For an explanation on how to use the charts, refer to the example provided by the manufacturer for that specific chart. [Figure1l-20]  

The information manufacturers furnish is not standardized. Information maybe contained in a table format and other information maybe contained in a graph format. Sometimes combined graphs incorporate two or more graphs into one chart tocompensatefor multiple conditions of flight. Combined graphs allow the pilot to predict aircraft performance for variations in density altitude,weight. and winds all on one chart.Because of the vast amount of information that canbe extractedfrom thistype ofchart,it is important to be very accurate in reading the chart.Asmall error in the beginning can lead to a large error at the end.  

The remainder of this section covers performance information for aircraft in general and discusses what information the chartscontain and how to extract information from the charts by direct reading and interpolation methods.Every chart contains a wealth of information that should be used when flight planning. Examples of the table, graph, and combined graph formats for all aspects of flight are discussed.

# Interpolation  

Not all of the information on the charts is easily extracted. Some charts require interpolation to find the information for specific flight conditions.Interpolating information means thatby taking the known information,a pilot can compute intermediate information.However,pilots sometimesround off values from charts to a more conservative figure.  

Using values that reflect slightly more adverse conditions provides a reasonable estimate of performance information andgives a slight margin ofsafety.Thefollowing illustration is an example of interpolating information from a takeoff distancechart.[Figure11-21]  

# Density Altitude Charts  

Use a density altitude chart to figure the density altitude at the departing airport. Using Figure 11-22, determine the density altitude based on the given information.  

# SampleProblem 1  

Airport Elevation. 5,883 feet OAT.  $.70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Altimeter. 30.10 "Hg  

First,compute the pressure altitude conversion.Find30.10 under the altimeter heading.Read across to the second column. It reads“-165."Therefore, it is necessary to subtract 165from the airport elevation giving a pressure altitude of 5,718 feet. Next, locate the outside air temperature on the scale along the bottom of the graph. From  $70^{\circ}$  ,drawalineup tothe5,718 feet pressure altitude line,whichis abouttwo- thirds of the way up between the 5,000and6,000footlines. Draw a line straight across to the far left side of the graph and read the approximate density altitude. The approximate densityaltitudeinthousandsoffeetis7,7o0feet.  

# Takeoff Charts  

Takeoff charts are typically provided in several forms and allow a pilot to compute the takeoff distance of the aircraft with noflaps or with a specificflap configuration. A pilot can also compute distances for an of lap takeoff over a 50 foot obstacle scenario,as well as with flaps over a 50 foot obstacle. The takeoff distance chart provides for various aircraft weights, altitudes, temperatures, winds, and obstacle heights.  

# SampleProblem 2  

Pressure Altitude. .2,000 feet OAT.  $.22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  TakeoffWeight. 2,600 pounds Headwind. .6 knots ObstacleHeight. 50footobstacle  

RefertoFigure11-23.Thischartisanexampleofacombined takeoff distance graph. It takes into consideration pressure altitude, temperature, weight, wind, and obstacles all on one chart. First, find the correct temperature on the bottom left side of thegraph.Follow the line from  $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  straightupuntil it intersects the 2,0o0 foot altitude line. From that point, draw a line straight across to the first dark reference line. Continue to draw the line from the reference point in a diagonal direction following the surrounding lines until it intersects the corresponding weight line.From the intersection of 2,600 pounds,draw a line straight across until it reaches the second reference line. Once again, follow the lines in a diagonal manner until it reaches the six knothead wind mark.Follow

straight across to the third reference line andfromhere,draw a lineintwo directions.First,draw a line straight across to figure the ground roll distance. Next, follow the diagonal lines again until they reach the corresponding obstacle height. In this case, it is a 50 foot obstacle. Therefore, draw the diagonal line to the far edge of the chart. This results in a 7oo foot ground roll distance and a total distance of 1,400 feet over a 50 foot obstacle. To find the corresponding takeoff speeds atlift-off and over the 50 foot obstacle,refer to the table on the top of the chart. In this case, the lift-off speed at 2,600 pounds would be 63 knots and over the 50foot obstacle wouldbe68knots.  

# SampleProblem3  

Pressure Altitude. 3,000 feet OAT.  $.30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Takeoff Weight. 2,400 pounds Headwind. .18 knots  

RefertoFigure11-24.Thischartisanexampleofatakeoff distance table for short-fieldtakeoffs.Forthistable,firstfind the takeoff weight. Once at 2,400 pounds, begin reading from left to right across the table. The takeoff speed is in the second column and, in the third column under pressure altitude, find the pressure altitude of 3,Ooofeet.Carefully follow that line to the right until it is under the correct temperature column of  $30\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$   The ground roll total reads 1,325 feet and the total required to clear a 50foot obstacleis 2,480feet.At this point, there is an18 knot headwind.According to the notes section under point number two, decrease the distances by ten percent foreach9knots of headwind.With an18knot headwind,it is necessary to decrease the distance by 20 percent.Multiply 1,325 feet by 20 percent (  $^{1,325\ \times}$   $20=265.$  ),subtractthe product from the total distance( $\left\lbrace1,325-265=1,060\right\rbrace$ ).Repeatthis process for the total distance over a 50 foot obstacle.The ground roll distance is 1,060 feet and the total distance over a 50foot obstacle is 1,984feet.  

# Climb and Cruise Charts  

Climb and cruise chart information is based on actualflight tests conducted in an aircraft of the same type.Thisinformation is extremely useful when planning a cross-country flight to predict the performance and fuel consumption of the aircraft. Manufacturers produce several different charts for climb and cruise performance. These charts include everything from fuel,time,and distance to climb to best power setting during cruise to cruise range performance.  

The first chart to check for climb performance is a fuel, time, and distance-to-climb chart. This chart gives the fuel amount used during the climb,the time it takes to accomplish the climb, and the ground distance that is covered during theclimb.Tousethischart,obtain the information for the departing airport and for the cruise altitude. Using Figure 11-25, calculate the fuel, time,and distance to climb based on the information provided.

Figure11-25.Fuel,time,and distanceclimbchart.  

First, find the information for the departing airport. Find the OAT for the departing airport along the bottom, left side of the graph. Follow the line from  $25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  straight up until it intersects the line corresponding to the pressure altitude of 6,000feet. Continue this line straight across until it intersects all three lines for fuel, time, and distance. Draw a line straight down fromtheintersectionofaltitudeandfuel,altitudeandtime,and athirdlineataltitudeanddistance.Itshouldreadthreeand one-halfgallons offuel,6 minutes of time,and nineNM.Next, repeat thestepstofind the information for the cruise altitude. It should read six gallons of fuel,1o.5minutesof time,and  $15\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  .Takeeachsetof numbersforfuel,time,and distance and subtract them from one another(  $6.0\,{-}\,3.5\,{=}\,2.5$  gallonsof fuel).It takes two and one-half gallons of fuel and 4 minutes of time to climb to 10,000feet.Duringthatclimb,thedistance covered is six NM. Remember, according to the notes at the topofthechart,thesenumbersdonottakeintoaccountwind, and it is assumed maximum continuous power is being used.  

The nextexampleis a fuel,time,and distance-to-climbtable. For thistable,use the same basic criteria asfor theprevious chart.However, it is necessary tofigure the information in a different manner.RefertoFigure11-26 to work the following sampleproblem.

Figure11-26.Fuel time distance climb  

twosets of numbersfrom one another,but giventhefact that the numbers read zero at sea level,it is known that the time to climb from sea level to 8,000 feet is 10 minutes.Itis also knownthat 21 pounds of fuel is used and  $20\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  is covered during the climb.However, the temperature is  $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  whichis  $7^{\circ}$  above the standard temperature of  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  Thenotessection of this chart indicate that the findings must be increased by ten percentforeach  $7^{\circ}$  above standard. Multiply thefindings by ten percent or .10 (  $10\times.10=1$   $1+10=11$  minutes). After accountingfor the additional ten percent, the findings should read 11 minutes, 23.1 pounds of fuel, and 22 NM.Notice that the fuel is reported in pounds of fuel, not gallons.Aviation fuel weighs six pounds per gallon, so 23.1 pounds of fuel is equalto3.85gallonsoffuel  $(23.1\div6=3.85)$  

The next example is a cruise and range performance chart. This type of table is designed to give TAS, fuel consumption endurance in hours,and rangein milesat specific cruise configurations.UseFigureIl-27 to determine the cruise and can ge performance under the given conditions.  

# Sample Problem 6  

Pressure Altitude 5,000feet RPM. 2,400 rpm Fuel Carrying Capacity. 38gallons,noreserve  

Find 5,oo0 feet pressure altitude in the first column on the left side of the table. Next, find the correct rpm of 2,400 in the second column. Follow that line straight across and readtheTASof  $116\,\mathrm{mph}$  and a fuelburn rate of 6.9 gallons per hour.As per the example, the aircraft is equipped with a fuel carrying capacity of 38 gallons. Under this column, read that the endurance in hours is 5.5 hours and the range inmilesis635miles.  

Cruise power setting tables are useful when planning cross- countryflights.The table gives the correct cruise power settings, as well as thefuel flow and airspeed performance numbers at that altitude and airspeed.  

# Sample Problem 7  

PressureAltitudeat Cruise. .6,000feet OAT.  $.36\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  above standard  

Refer toFigure 11-28for this sample problem.First,locate the pressure altitude of 6,oo 0 feet on the far left side of the table.Follow that line across to thefar right side of the table underthe  $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (or  $36~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) column. At 6,000 feet, the rpm settingof2,450 will maintain 65 percent continuous power at  $21.0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{Hg}$  with a fuel flow rate of 11.5 gallons per hour and airspeed of 161 knots.

Another type of cruise chart is a bestpower mixture range graph. This graph gives the best range based on power setting and altitude.Using Figure 11-29, find the range at 65 percent power with and without a reservebased on the provided conditions.  

# SampleProblem 8  

OAT. .Standard PressureAltitude 5,000 feet  

First, move up the left side of the graph to 5,0o0 feet and standard temperature.Follow the line straight across the graph until it intersects the 65 percent line under both the reserve and no reserve categories. Draw a line straight down from both intersections to the bottom of the graph. At 65 percent power with a reserve, the range is approximately 522 miles. At 65 percent power with no reserve, the range should be 581 miles.  

Thelast cruise chart referenced is a cruise performance graph This graph is designed to tell the TASperformance of the airplane depending on the altitude, temperature, and power setting.UsingFigure11-30,find the T AS performance based on the given information.

However, it is necessary to subtract 8 knots from the speed since there are no wheel fairings.This note is listed under the title and conditions. The T AS is 132 knots.  

# Crosswind and Headwind Component Chart  

Every aircraft is tested according to Federal Aviation Administration(FAA)regulations prior to certification.The aircraft is tested by a pilot with average piloting skills in  $90^{\circ}$  crosswinds with a velocity up to  $0.2~\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S0}}$  ortwo-tenths of the aircraft's stalling speed with power off, gear down, and flaps down. This means that if the stalling speed of the aircraft is 45knots,it must be capable oflanding in a 9-knot,  $90^{\circ}$  crosswind.The maximum demonstrated crosswind component is published in the AFM/POH.Thecrosswindand headwind component chart allows for figuring the headwind and crosswind component for any given wind direction and velocity.  

# Sample Problem 10  

Runway... Wind.  $140^{\circ}$  at 25 knots  

RefertoFigure11-31 tosolvethis problem.First,determine how many degrees difference there is between the runway and the wind direction. It is known that runway 17 means adirectionof  $170^{\circ}$  ;from that subtract the wind direction Oof  $140^{\circ}$  .This gives a  $30^{\circ}$  angular difference or wind angle. Next,locatethe  $30^{\circ}$  mark and draw a line from thereuntil it intersects the correct wind velocity of 25 knots. From

Figure 11-30.Cruise performance graph  

there, draw a line straight down and a line straight across. The headwind component is 22 knots and the crosswind component is 13 knots.This information is important when taking off and landing so that, first of all, the appropriate runway can be picked if more than one exists at a particular airport,but also so that the aircraft is not pushed beyond its testedlimits.  

# Landing Charts  

Landing performance is affected by variables similar to those affecting takeoff performance.It is necessary to compensate for differences in density altitude, weight of the airplane, and headwinds. Like takeoff performance charts, landing distance information is available as normal landing information, as well as landing distance over a 50 foot obstacle.As  

![](images/285cd9f316ff9271e068ec2f75c8181ac58f528b3853d1438f5e71945da55245.jpg)  
Figure 10-31.Crosswind component chart.  

usual,read the associated conditions and notes in order to ascertain thebasis ofthe chart information.Remember,when calculating landing distance that the landing weight is not the same as the takeoff weight. The weight must be recalculated to compensatefor thefuel that was used during theflight

Refer to Figure 10-32. This example makes use of alanding distancetable.Notice that the altitude of 1,250feetisnot on this table.It is, therefore,necessary to interpolate to find the correct landing distance. The pressure altitude of 1,250 is halfway between sea level and 2,500feet.First,find the column for sea level and the column for 2,500feet.Takethe total distance of 1,O 75 for sea level and the total distance off 1,135for2,500and add themtogether.Dividethetotal by two to obtain the distance for 1,250feet.Thedistanceis1,105 feet total landing distance to clear a 50 foot obstacle.Repeat this process to obtain the ground roll distance for the pressure altitude.The ground roll should be 457.5feet.

# Chapter Summary  

Performance characteristics and capabilities varygreatly among aircraft. As transport aircraft become more capable and more complex, most operators find themselves having to rely increasingly on computerized flight mission planning systems. These systems may be on board or used during the planning phase of the flight. Moreover, aircraft weight. atmospheric conditions,and external environmental factors can significantly affect aircraft performance. It is essential that a pilot become intimately familiar with themission planning programs,performance characteristics,and capabilities of the aircraft being flown, as well as all of the onboard computerized systems in today's complex aircraft. Theprimary source of this information is theAFM/POH.

# Chapter 12 Weather Theory  

# Introduction  

Weather is an important factor that influences aircraft performance and flyingsafety.Itis thestate ofthe atmosphere at a given time and place with respect to variables, such as temperature (heat or cold), moisture (wetness or dryness), wind velocity (calm or storm),visibility (clearness or cloudiness), and barometric pressure (high or low). The term "weather" can also apply to adverse or destructive atmospheric conditions,such ashighwinds.  

This chapter explains basic weather theory and offers pilots background knowledge of weather principles. It is designed to help them gain a good understanding of how weather affects daily flying activities. Understanding the theories behind weather helps a pilot make sound weather decisions based on the reports and forecasts obtained from a Flight ServiceStation(FSS)weather specialist and other aviation weatherservices.  

Be it a local flight or a long cross-country flight, decisions based on weather can dramatically affect thesafety of theflight.  

# Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is a blanket of air made up of a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth and reaches almost 350 miles from the surface of the Earth.This mixture is in constant motion.If the atmosphere were visible,itmightlooklike an ocean with swirls and eddies,rising andfalling air,and waves that travel for great distances.  

Life on Earth is supported by the atmosphere, solar energy, andtheplanet'smagneticfields.The atmosphere absorbs energy from the sun, recycles water and other chemicals, and workswith theelectrical and magnetic forces toprovide a moderate climate. The atmosphere also protects life on Earth from high energy radiation and the frigid vacuum of space.  

# Composition of the Atmosphere  

In any given volume of air, nitrogen accounts for 78 percent of the gases that comprise the atmosphere,while oxygen makes up21 percent.Argon,carbondioxide,and traces of other gases make up the remaining one percent. This volume of air also contains some water vapor, varying from zero to about five percent by volume. This small amount of water vapor is responsible for major changes in the weather. [Figure12-1]  

The envelope of gases surrounding the Earth changes from theground up.Four distinct layers or spheres of the  

![](images/9fcec36955c9940c260a7560bd0cef81616a481bddc6dc68cd955047a54db047.jpg)

atmosphere have been identified usingthermal characteristics (temperature changes), chemical composition, movement, anddensity.[Figure12-2]  

The first layer,knownas the troposphere,extends from 6 to 20kilometers(km) (4 to12miles)over thenorthern and southern poles and up to 48,000feet(  $14.5\ \mathrm{km})$  overthe equatorial regions.The vast majority of weather,clouds, storms,and temperature variances occur within this first layer of the atmosphere. Inside the troposphere, the average temperature decreases at a rate of about  $2\,^{\circ}$  Celsius(C)every  

![](images/008e6d8a8b03b47d181c3c394b0e0f48eaa50bc1af6d4d25859bc99cde4ce852.jpg)  
Figure12-2.Layers of the atmosphere.  

1,000 feet of altitude gain, and the pressure decreases at a rate of about one inch per 1,ooofeetof altitudegain  

At the top of the troposphere is a boundaryknown as the tropopause,which traps moisture and the associated weather in the troposphere. The altitude of the tropopause varies with latitude and with the season of the year;therefore,ittakes on an elliptical shape as opposed to round. Location of the tropopauseis important because it is commonly associated with the location of the jetstream and possible clear air turbulence.  

Above the tropopause are three more atmospheric levels.The firstis the stratosphere,which extends from the tropopause to a height of about 160,000feet  $(50\,\mathrm{km})$  .Little weather exists in this layer and the air remains stable, although certain types of clouds occasionally extend in it.Above the stratosphere are the mesosphere and thermosphere,whichhavelittle influence over weather.  

# Atmospheric Circulation  

Asnotedearlier,the atmosphere is in constant motion. Certain factors combine to set the atmosphere in motion, but a major factoris the uneven heating of the Earth's surface. This heating upsets the equilibrium of the atmosphere, creating changes in air movement and atmospheric pressure. The movement of air around the surface of the Earth is called atmospheric circulation.  

Heating of the Earth's surface is accomplished by several processes,but in the simple convection-only model used for this discussion, the Earth is warmed by energy radiating from thesun.The process causes a circular motion that results whenwarm air rises and is replaced by cooler air.  

Warm air rises because heat causes air molecules to spread apart.Astheairexpands,it becomes less dense and lighter than the surrounding air.Asaircools,the molecules pack together more closely, becoming denser and heavier than warm air.As aresult,cool,heavy airtends tosink and replace warmer,rising air.  

Because the Earth has a curved surface that rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the sun, the equatorial regions of theEarth receive a greater amount of heat from the sun than the polar regions. The amount of solar energy that heats the Earth depends on thetime of year and thelatitude of the specific region.All of these factors affect the length of time and the angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.  

Solar heating causes higher temperatures in equatorial areas, which causes the air to be less dense and rise.Asthewarm air flows toward the poles,itcools,becoming denserand sinks back toward the surface.Figure12-3]  

![](images/6a2dba4c70b46ee2562251ab671936d6c1d137d3e25940cedf5c9de5a06f2408.jpg)  
Figure12-3.Circulation pattern in a static environment  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

The unequal heating of the Earth's surface not only modifies air density and creates circulation patterns; it also causes changes in air pressure or the force exerted by the weight of air molecules. Although air molecules are invisible, they still have weight and take up space  

Imagineasealedcolumnofairthathasafootprintofone squareinch and is 350 miles high.It wouldtake14.7pounds ofefforttolift that column.This represents the air'sweight; if the column is shortened,thepressure exerted atthebottom (anditsweight)wouldbeless.  

Theweightof the shortened column of airat18,000feetis approximately 7.4 pounds; almost 50 percent that at sealevel. Forinstance,if abathroomscale(calibrated for sea level) were raised to 18,000 feet, the column of air weighing 14.7 pounds at sea level would be 18,0o0 feet shorter and would weigh approximately 7.3 pounds (50 percent) less than at sealevel.[Figure12-4]  

The actual pressure at a given place and time differs with altitude, temperature, and density of the air. These conditions also affect aircraft performance, especially with regard to takeoff,rate of climb,andlandings.  

# Coriolis Force  

In general atmospheric circulation theory,areasoflow pressure exist over the equatorial regions and areas of high pressure exist over the polar regions due to a difference in temperature.The resulting low pressure allows the high- pressure air at the poles to flow along the planet's surface toward the equator.While this pattern of air circulation is  

![](images/c3a4089aee86ee9c4a111b6a8d4f52ad478faa12decd935c7737ddb32535fc7e.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.Atmosphere weights  

correct in theory, the circulation of air is modified by several forces, the mostimportant of which is the rotation of the Earth.  

The force created by the rotation of the Earth is known as the Coriolis force. This force is not perceptible to humans as they walk around because humans move slowly and travel relatively short distances compared to the size and rotation rate of the Earth. However, the Coriolis force significantly affects motion over large distances, such as an air mass or bodyofwater.  

The Coriolis force deflects air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing it to follow a curved path instead of a straight line. The amount of deflection differs depending on thelatitude.It is greatest at the poles and diminishes to zero at the equator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs with the speed of the moving bodythe greater the speed, the greater the deviation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the rotation of the Earth deflects moving air to the right and changes the general circulation pattern of the air.  

TheCoriolisforcecauses thegeneralflow tobreakupinto three distinct cells in each hemisphere. [Figure 12-5] In the Northern Hemisphere,the warm air at the equator rises upward from the surface,travels northward,andisdeflected eastward by the rotation of the Earth.Bythetimeithas traveled one-third of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward. Thisaircoolsandsinksinabelt-likeareaatabout  $30^{\circ}$  latitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks toward  

![](images/0e855795a6cec989593dccce00aae92d31b3829311045600966ad0b9d5b79839.jpg)  
Figure12-5.Three-cell circulation pattern due to the rotation of theEarth.  

the surface. Then, it flows southward along the surface back toward theequator.Coriolis force bends theflowtothe right thuscreating the northeasterly tradewinds thatprevailfrom  $30^{\circ}$  latitude to the equator.Similar forces create circulation cells that encircle the Earth between  $30^{\circ}$  and  $60^{\circ}$  latitudeand between  $60^{\circ}$  and the poles. This circulation pattern results in the prevailing upper level westerly winds in the con term i nous UnitedStates.  

Circulation patterns are further complicated by seasonal changes,differences between the surfaces of continents and oceans, and other factors such as frictional forces caused by the topography of the Earth's surface that modify the movement of the air in the atmosphere. For example, within 2,000 feet of the ground, thefriction between the surface and the atmosphere slows the moving air. The wind is diverted from its pathbecause of the frictional force.Thus,the wind direction at the surface varies somewhat from the wind direction just a few thousand feet above the Earth.  

# Measurement of Atmosphere Pressure  

Atmospheric pressure historically was measured in inches of mercury  $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$  by a mercurial barometer.[Figure12-6]The barometer measures the height of a column of mercury inside a glass tube.Asection of themercuryis exposed to thepressure of the atmosphere, which exerts a force on the mercury. An increaseinpressureforcesthemercurytoriseinsidethetube. When the pressure drops, mercury drains out of the tube decreasing theheight of thecolumn.Thistype ofbarometeris typically used in a laboratory or weather observation station, is not easily transported,anddifficult toread.  

![](images/525ccccd5aed415289a8e3f5689486b1e2217647588c13cc400b8f415ea160bb.jpg)  
Figure12-6.Although mercurial barometers are no longer used intheU.S.,they are still a good historical reference for where the altimeter setting came from(inchesofmercury).  

An a nero id barometer is the standard instrument used tomeasurepressure;itiseasiertoreadandtransport. [Figure12-7]The a nero id barometer contains a closed vessel called an aneroid cell that contracts orexpands with changes in pressure. The aneroid cell attaches to a pressure indicator with a mechanical linkage to provide pressure readings. The pressure sensingpart of an aircraft altimeter is essentially an a nero id barometer.It is important to note that due to  

![](images/6d99eb64f53c6799c74f54d4b647f0621dacdb7abed8d79d65a89c5ffdad7f15.jpg)  
Figure12-7.A nero id barometer.  

the linkage mechanism of an aneroid barometer, it is not as accurate as a mercurial barometer.  

To provide a common reference, the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) has been established. These standard conditions are the basis for certain flight instruments and most aircraft performance data. Standard sea level pressure is defined as  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  and a standard temperature of  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  .Atmospheric pressure is also reported in millibars (mb),with  $1\,^{\mathrm{"Hg}}$  equalto approximately  $34\,\mathrm{mb}$  .Standard sea levelpressureis  $1{,}013{.}2~\mathrm{mb}$  .Typical mb pressure readings rangefrom950.0to  $1{,}040{.}0\,\mathrm{mb}$  .Surfacecharts,highandlow pressurecenters,and hurricane data arereportedusing mb.  

Since weather stations arelocated around theglobe,alllocal barometric pressure readings are converted to a sea level pressure to provide a standard for records and reports. To achievethis,each station converts its barometric pressure by adding approximately  $1\,^{\mathrm{"Hg}}$  forevery1,000feet ofelevation. Forexample,astation at5,0 o 0 feet above sea level,witha readingof  $24.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  , reports a sea level pressure reading of  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .[Figure 12-8] Using common sea level pressure readings helps ensure aircraft altimeters aresetcorrectly based on the current pressure readings.  

By tracking barometric pressure trends across a large area weather forecasters can more accurately predict movement of pressure systems and the associated weather.Forexample tracking a pattern of rising pressure at a single weather station generally indicates the approach of fair weather.Conversely, decreasing or rapidly falling pressure usually indicates approaching bad weather and,possibly,severestorms.  

# Altitude and Atmospheric Pressure  

As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. On average,withevery1,o 0 of eet of increase in altitude,the atmospheric pressure decreases  $1\,^{\mathrm{"Hg}}$  .As pressure decreases, the air becomes less dense or thinner. This is the equivalent of being at a higher altitude and is referred to as density altitude. As pressure decreases, density altitude increases and has a pronounced effect on aircraft performance.  

Differences in air density caused by changes in temperature result in a change in pressure. This, in turn, creates motion in the atmosphere, both vertically and horizontally, in the form of currents and wind. The atmosphere is almost constantly in motion as it strives to reach equilibrium.These never-ending air movements setup chain reactions thatcause acontinuing variety in the weather.  

![](images/b9f70334dada18cbd13e2c0c81bdb65634615c5d788540c5bcf0c98a2a25f90b.jpg)  
Figure12-8.Station pressure is converted to and reported in sea level pressure.  

# Altitude and Flight  

Altitude affects every aspect of flight from aircraft performance to human performance.At higher altitudes. with a decreased atmospheric pressure,takeoff and landing distances are increased,while climb rates decrease.  

When an aircrafttakesoff,lift iscreatedby theflowof air around the wings. If the air is thin, more speed is required to obtain enough lift for takeoff; therefore, the ground run is longer.An aircraft that requires 745feet of ground run at sea level requires more than double that at a pressure altitude of8,000feet.[Figure12-9].It is also true that at higher altitudes,due to the decreased density of the air,aircraft engines and propellers are less efficient. This leads toreduced rates of climb and a greater ground run for obstacle clearance.  

# Altitudeand theHumanBody  

As discussed earlier, nitrogen and other trace gases make up 79 percent of the atmosphere, while the remaining 21  

![](images/57b11d96ad961022b2eda60014c26421e85b190f48b110a1e4fe1faf2769e3bc.jpg)  
Figure12-9.Takeoff distances increase with increased altitude.  

percent is life sustaining atmospheric oxygen. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is great enough to support normal growth, activity, and life.By 18,000 feet, the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced and adversely affects the normal activities andfunctionsof thehumanbody.  

The reactions of the average person become impaired at an altitude of about 10,000feet, but for some people impairment can occur at an altitude as low as 5,000 feet. The physiological reactions to hypoxia or oxygen deprivation are insidious and affect people in different ways. These symptoms range from mild disorientation to total incapacitation, depending on body tolerance and altitude. Supplemental oxygen or cabin pressurization systems help pilots fly at higher altitudes and overcome the effects of oxygen deprivation  

# Wind and Currents  

Air flows from areas of high pressure into areas of low pressure because air always seeks out lower pressure.The combination of atmospheric pressure differences,Coriolis force, friction, and temperature differences of the air near the earth cause two kinds of atmospheric motion:convective currents(upward and downward motion)andwind (horizontal motion). Currents and winds are important as they affect takeoff,landing, and cruise flight operations.Most importantly,currents and winds or atmospheric circulation cause weather changes.  

# WindPatterns  

In the Northern Hemisphere, the flow of air from areas of high to low pressure is deflected to the right and produces a clockwise circulation around an area of high pressure. This is known as anticyclonic circulation. The opposite is true of low-pressure areas; the air flows toward a low and is deflected to create a counterclockwise or cyclonic circulation.[Figure12-1o]  

High-pressure systems are generally areas of dry, descending air.Good weather is typically associated with high-pressure systems for this reason.Conversely,air flows into a low- pressure area to replace rising air. This air usually brings increasing cloudiness and precipitation. Thus, bad weather is commonly associated with areas of low pressure.  

A good understanding ofhigh-and low-pressure wind patterns can be of great help when planning a flight because a pilot can take advantage of beneficial tailwinds.[Figure12-11/When planning a flight from west to east, favorable winds would be encountered along the northern side of a high-pressure system or the southern side of a low-pressure system. On the return flight, the most favorable winds would be along the southern side of the same high-pressure system or the northern side of a low-pressure system. An added advantage  

![](images/4c32645705965ec2c9bdfb20f01411ba0fcf085d2e1c12564d33e547dcf00807.jpg)  
Figure12-10.Circulation pattern about areas of high and low pressure.  

is a better understanding of what type of weather toexpect in a given area along a route of flight based on the prevailing areas of highs and lows.  

Whilethe theory of circulation and wind patterns is accuratefor largescale atmospheric circulation,it doesnot takeintoaccount changes to the circulation on a local scale. Local conditions, geological features,and other anomaliescan changethewind direction and speed close to theEarth's surface.  

# Convective Currents  

Plowed ground,rocks,sand,and barrenland absorb solar energy quickly and can therefore give off a large amount of heat; whereas, water, trees, and other areas of vegetation tendtomoreslowlyabsorbheatandgiveoffheat.The resulting uneven heating of the air creates small areas off local circulation called convective currents.  

Convective currents cause the bumpy,turbulent air sometimes experienced when flying at lower altitudes during warmer weather. On a low-altitude flight over varying surfaces, updrafts are likely to occur over pavement or barren places, and downdrafts often occur over water or expansive areas of vegetation like a group of trees.Typically, these turbulent conditions can be avoided by flying at higher altitudes, even above cumulus cloud layers.[Figure12-12]  

Convective currents are particularly noticeable in areaswith a land mass directly adjacent to a large body of water, such as an ocean, large lake, or other appreciable area of water. During the day,land heats faster than water, so the air over the land becomes warmer and less dense. It rises and is replaced by  

![](images/441d950e0fbe50b3cd8b77f9c7d07e5183ef630a55d58062a14ad28fff3ac613.jpg)

Figure12-12.Convective turbulence avoidance.  

cooler,denser air flowing in from over the water.Thiscauses an onshore wind called a sea breeze.Conversely, at night land cools faster than water, as does the corresponding air.In this case,the warmer air over the water rises and is replaced by the cooler,denser airfromtheland,creating anoffshorewind called a land breeze.This reverses the local wind circulation pattern. Convective currents can occur anywhere there is an uneven heating of the Earth'ssurface.[FigureI2-/3]  

Convective currents close to the ground can affect a pilot's ability to control the aircraft.Forexample, onfinal approach, the rising air from terrain devoid of vegetation sometimes produces a ballooning effect that cancause a pilot toovershoot the intended landing spot. On the other hand, an approach over a largebody of water or an area of thickvegetation tends to create a sinking effect that can cause an unwary pilot to land short of the intended landing spot.[Figure12-14]  

# Effect of Obstructions on Wind  

Another atmospheric hazard exists that can create problems for pilots.Obstructions on the ground affect the flow of wind and can be an unseen danger.Ground topography and large buildings can breakup the flow of the wind and create wind gusts that change rapidly in direction and speed. These obstructions range from man-made structures, like hangars, to large natural obstructions, such as mountains, bluffs, or canyons.It is especially important to be vigilant when flying in or out of airports that have large buildings or natural obstructions located near therunway.[Figure12-15]  

The intensity of theturbulence associated with ground obstructions depends onthesize of the obstacle and the primary velocity of thewind.Thiscan affect the takeoff and landing performance of any aircraft and can present a very serious hazard. During the landing phase of flight, an aircraft  

![](images/286f1a9b039c125cba07a59be957aaa9fb98528874278165cf74236884c9f0eb.jpg)

Figure12-15.Turbulence caused by manmade obstructions  

may“drop in' due to the turbulent air and be too low to clear obstacles during the approach  

This same condition is even more noticeable when flying in mountainous regions.[Figure12-16]While thewindflows smoothlyup thewindward sideof the mountain and the upward currents help to carry an aircraft over thepeak of the mountain, the wind on the leeward side does not act in asimilarmanner.As the air flows down the leeward side off themountain,the air follows the contour of the terrain and is increasingly turbulent. Thistends topush an aircraft into the side of a mountain.The stronger the wind,thegreaterthe downward pressure and turbulence become.  

Due to the effect terrain has on the wind invalleys or canyons, downdrafts can be severe. Before conducting a flight in or  

![](images/a02f877cdb8483260a025a55f52ed09b1c98e8befb3c5f7724a1a429ce8f4169.jpg)  
Figure12-16.Turbulencein mountainous regions  

near mountainous terrain, it is helpful for a pilot unfamiliai with a mountainous area to get a checkout with a mountain qualified flight instructor.  

# Low-Level Wind Shear  

Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in wind speed and/or direction over a very small area. Wind shear can subject an aircraft to violent updrafts and downdrafts,aswellasabrupt changes to the horizontal movement of the aircraft.While wind shear can occur at any altitude, low-level wind shear is especially hazardous due totheproximity of an aircraftto the ground. Low-level wind shear is commonly associated with passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, temperature inversions, and strong upper level winds (greater than 25 knots).  

Wind shear is dangerous to an aircraft. It can rapidly change theperformance of the aircraft and disrupt thenormal flight attitude.For example, a tailwind quickly changing to a headwind causes an increase in airspeed and performance. Conversely, a headwind changing to a tailwind causes a decrease in airspeed and performance. In either case, a pilot must be prepared to react immediately to these changes to maintain control of the aircraft.  

The most severe type of low-level wind shear, a microburst, is associated with convective precipitation into dry air at cloud base.Microburst activity may be indicated by an intense rain shaft at the surface but vi rg a at cloud base and a ring of blowing dust is often the only visible clue. Atypical micro burst has a horizontal diameter of 1-2 miles and a nominal depth of 1,ooo feet. The lifespan of a microburst is about 5-15 minutes during which time it can produce downdrafts of up to 6,ooo feet per minute (fpm)  

and headwind losses of 30-90 knots,seriously degrading performance. It can also produce strong turbulence and hazardous wind direction changes. Consider Figure 12-17: During an inadvertent takeoff into a microburst, the plane mayfirst experience a performance-increasing headwind (1), followed by performance-decreasing downdrafts (2), followed by a rapidly increasing tailwind (3). This can result in terrain impact or flight dangerously close to the ground (4). An encounter during approach involves the same sequence of wind changes and could force the plane to the ground short of the runway.  

The FAA has made a substantial investment in micro burst accident prevention.The totally redesigned LL WAS-NE,the TDWR, and the ASR-9 WSP are skillful microburst alerting systems installed at major airports.These three systems were extensively evaluated over a 3-yearperiod.Eachwasseen to issue very few false alerts and to detect micro bursts well above the 90percent detection requirement established by Congress. Many flights involve airports that lack microburst alert equipment, so the FAA has also prepared wind shear training material: Advisory Circular (AC) 00-54,FAA Pilot WindS hear Guide.Include disinformation on how to recognize the risk of a micro burst encounter,howtoavoid an encounter, and the best flight strategy for successful escape should an encounter occur.  

It is important to remember that wind shear can affect any flight and any pilot at any altitude.While wind shear may be reported, it often remains undetected and is a silent danger toaviation.Always be alert to the possibility of winds hear. especially when flying in and around thunderstorms and frontalsystems.

# Wind and Pressure Representation on Surface WeatherMaps  

Surface weather maps provide information about fronts,areas of high and low pressure, and surface winds and pressures foreachstation.This type of weather map allows pilots to see the locations of fronts and pressure systems, but more importantly, it depicts the wind and pressure at the surface for each location. For more information on surface analysis and weather depiction charts,seeChapter13,Aviation WeatherServices.  

Wind conditions are reported by an arrow attached to the station location circle./FigureI2-/8/The station circle represents the head of the arrow, with the arrow pointing in the direction from which the wind is blowing. Winds are described by the direction from which they blow,thus a northwest wind means that the wind is blowing from the northwest toward the southeast. The speed of the wind is depicted by barbs or pennants placed on the wind line. Each barb represents a speed of ten knots, while half a barb is equal to five knots, and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.  

Thepressurefor each station is recorded on the weather chart andisshowninmb.Isobars are lines drawn on the chart to depict lines of equal pressure. These lines result in a pattern that reveals the pressure gradient or change in pressure over distance.[Figure12-19]Isobars are similar to contour lines on a topographic map that indicate terrain altitudes and slopesteepness.Forexample,isobarsthat are closely spaced indicate a steep pressure gradient and strong winds prevail. Shallow gradients,on the other hand,are representedby isobars that are spaced far apart and are indicative of light winds. Isobars help identify low- and high-pressure systems, as well as the location of ridges and troughs. A high is an area of high pressure surrounded by lower pressure;alow is an area of low pressure surrounded by higher pressure. A ridge is an elongated area of high pressure, and a trough is an elongated area of lowpressure.  

Isobars furnish valuable information about winds in the first fewthousandfeet abovethesurface.Close to the ground

wind direction is modified by the friction andwindspeed decreases due to friction with the surface.At levels 2,0o0 to 3,000 feet above the surface, however, the speed is greater and the direction becomes more parallel to the isobars.  

Generally,thewind2,000 feet aboveground level(AGL)is  $20^{\circ}$  to  $40^{\circ}$  to the right of surface winds,and the wind speed is greater. The change of wind direction is greatest over rough terrainandleastoverflatsurfaces,suchasopenwater.In the absence of winds aloft information,this rule of thumb allows for a rough estimate of the wind conditions a few thousand feet abovethesurface.  

# Atmospheric Stability  

The stability of the atmosphere depends on its ability to resistvertical motion.A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult,and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear. In an unstable atmosphere,small vertical air movementstend tobecomelarger, resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity.Instability can lead to significant turbulence,extensive vertical clouds,and severe weather  

Rising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air pressure as altitude increases.The opposite istrue of descending air;as atmospheric pressure increases,the temperature of descending air increases as it is compressed. Adiabatic heating and adiabatic cooling are termsused to describe this temperature change.  

The adiabatic processtakes place in all upward and downward moving air.When airrises intoan area oflower pressure,it expands to a larger volume.Asthemolecules of air expand, the temperature of the air lowers.As a result, when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume increases,and temperature decreases.Whenairdescends, the oppositeis true.Therate at which temperature decreases with an increase in altitude is referred to as its lapse rate. As air ascends through the atmosphere, the average rate of temperature change is  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  per1,ooofeet.  

Since water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases air density,causing it to rise.Conversely,as moisture decreases, air becomes denser and tends to sink.Since moist air cools ataslowerrate,it is generally less stable than dry air since the moist air must rise higher before its temperature cools to that of the surrounding air.The dry adiabatic lapse rate (unsaturated air)is  $3\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(5.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  per1,000feet.Themoist adiabatic lapse rate varies from  $1.1~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $2.8\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   $2\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  to  $5\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   per 1,000 feet.  

The combination ofmoisture and temperature determine the stability of the air and the resulting weather.Cool,dry air is very stable and resists vertical movement,whichleadsto good and generally clear weather.The greatest instability occurs when the air is moist and warm, as it is in the tropical regions in the summer. Typically, thunderstorms appear on a daily basis in these regions due to the instability of the surroundingair.  

# Inversion  

As air rises and expands in the atmosphere, the temperature decreases. There is an atmospheric anomaly that can occur; however, that changes this typical pattern of atmospheric behavior. When the temperature of the air rises with altitude, a temperature in version exists.Inversionlayers are commonly shallow layers of smooth, stable air close to the ground. The temperature of the air increaseswith altitude to a certain point, which is the top of the inversion. The air at the top of the layer acts as a lid, keeping weather and pollutants trapped below.If the relative humidity of the air is high,it can contribute to the formation of clouds,fog,haze,or smoke resulting in diminished visibility in the inversion layer.  

Surface-based temperature inversions occur on clear,cool nights when the air close to the ground is cooled by the lowering temperature of theground.The air within a few hundred feet of the surface becomes cooler than the air above it.Frontal inversions occur when warm air spreads over a layerofcoolerair,orcoolerairisforcedunderalayerof warmerair.  

# Moisture and Temperature  

The atmosphere, by nature, contains moisture in the form of water vapor. The amount of moisture present in the atmosphere is dependent upon the temperature of the air. Every  $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  increasein temperature doubles the amount of moisture the air can hold. Conversely, a decrease of  $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  cuts the capacity in half  

Water is present in the atmosphere in three states: liquid, solid, and gaseous.All three forms can readily change to another, and all are present within the temperature ranges of theatmosphere.As water changes from one state to another, an exchange of heat takes place. These changes occur through the processes of evaporation,sublimation,condensation, deposition, melting, or freezing. However, water vapor is added into theatmosphere onlyby theprocesses of evaporation and sublimation.  

Evaporation is the changing of liquidwater towater vapor. As water vapor forms, it absorbs heat from the nearest available source. This heat exchange is known as the latent heat of evaporation.A good example is the evaporation of human perspiration.The net effect is a cooling sensation as heat is extracted from the body. Similarly, sublimation is the changing of ice directly to water vapor, completely bypassing the liquid stage. Though dry ice is not made of water, but rather carbon dioxide,it demonstrates the principle ofsublimationwhenasolidturnsdirectlyintovapor.  

# Relative Humidity  

Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere at a given time. Relative humidity is the actual amount of moisture in the air compared to the total amount of moisture the air could hold at that temperature. For example. if the current relative humidity is 65 percent, the air is holding 65 percent of the total amount of moisture that it is capable of holding at that temperature and pressure. While much of the western United States rarely sees days of high humidity, relative humidity readings of 75 to 90 percent are not uncommon in the southern United States during warmer months.[Figure12-20]  

# Temperature/DewPoint Relationship  

The relationship between dew point and temperature defines the concept of relative humidity. The dew point, given in degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no moremoisture.When the temperature of theairisreduced to the dewpoint,the airis completely saturated and moisture beginstocondenseoutoftheairintheformoffog,dew, frost,clouds,rain,orsnow.

Figure12-20.Relationship between relative humidity,temperature,anddewpoint  

Asmoist,unstable air rises,clouds often format the altitude wheretemperatureanddewpointreachthesamevalue.When lifted,unsaturatedaircools atarateof  $5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  per1,000feet and the dew point temperature decreases at a rate of  $1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  per 1,000 feet. This results in a convergence of temperature and dewpoint at a rate of  $4.4\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  Apply the convergence rate to the reported temperature and dew point to determine the height of the cloud base.  

Given:  

Temperature  $(\mathrm{T})=85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Dew point  $(\mathrm{DP})=71~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Convergence Rate  $\mathrm{(CR)}=4.4^{\circ}$   $\mathrm{T-DP=}$  Temperature Dew Point Spread (TDS)  $\mathrm{TDS}\div\mathrm{CR}=\mathrm{X}$   $\mathrm{X}\times1{,}000$  feet  $=$  heightof cloudbaseAGL  

Example:

Explanation:  

With an outside air temperature (OAT) of  $85\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  at the surface anddewpoint atthesurfaceof  $71\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  thespreadis  $14^{\circ}$  .Divide the temperature dew point spread by the convergencerate of  $4.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , and multiply by 1,000 to determine the approximate height of the cloud base.  

# Methods by Which Air Reaches the Saturation Point  

If air reaches the saturation point while temperature and dew point are close together, it is highly likely that fog, low clouds, and precipitation will form. There are four methods bywhich air can reach the saturation point.First,whenwarm air moves over a cold surface,the air temperature drops and reaches the saturation point. Second, the saturation point may be reachedwhen cold air andwarm airmix.Third,when air cools at night through contact with the cooler ground,air reaches its saturation point.The fourth method occurs when air is lifted or is forced upward in the atmosphere.  

As air rises, it uses heat energy to expand. As a result, the rising air loses heat rapidly. Unsaturated air loses heat at a rate of  $3.0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,(5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  for every 1,000feet of altitude gain. No matter what causes the air to reach its saturation point, saturated air brings clouds, rain, and other critical weather situations.  

# Dew and Frost  

On cool, clear, calm nights, the temperature of the ground and objects on the surface can cause temperatures of the surrounding air to drop below the dew point. When this occurs, the moisture in the air condenses and deposits itself on the ground, buildings, and other objects like cars and aircraft. Thismoisture isknown as dew and sometimes canbe seen on grass and other objects in the morning. If the temperature is below freezing, the moisture is deposited in the form of frost.While dew poses no threatto an aircraft,frostposes a definite flight safety hazard.Frostdisrupts theflow of air over the wing and can drastically reduce the production of lift.It also increases drag,which when combined with lowered lift production,can adversely affect the abilitytotake off.An aircraft must be thoroughly cleaned and free of frost prior tobeginning aflight.  

# Fog  

Fog is a cloud that is on the surface.It typically occurs when the temperature of air near the ground is cooled to the air's dew point. At this point, water vapor in the air condenses and becomes visible in the form of fog. Fog is classified according to the manner in which it forms and is dependent upon the current temperature and the amount of water vapor in the air  

On clear nights, with relatively little to no wind present. radiationfogmay develop./Figure12-21/Usually,it forms in low-lying areas like mountain valleys. This type of fog occurs when the ground cools rapidly due to terrestrial radiation, and the surrounding air temperature reaches its dew point. As the sun rises and the temperature increases, radiation fog lifts and eventually burns off.Anyincreasein wind also speeds the dissipation of radiation fog.Ifradiation fog is less than 20 feet thick, it is known as ground fog.  

When a layer of warm, moist air moves over a cold surface, advection fog is likely to occur. Unlike radiation fog, wino is required to form advection fog. Winds of up to 15 knots  

![](images/508020d16df1d8f14aa3f34f162d24dafa81d4e1817a0645bc5145465e7dde82.jpg)  
Figure 12-21. Radiation fog.  

allowthefogtoformandintensify;aboveaspeedof15knots the fog usually lifts and form slow stratus clouds.Advection fog is common in coastal areas where sea breezes can blow the air over cooler landmasses.  

Upslope fog occurs when moist, stable air is forced up sloping land features like a mountain range. This type of fog also requires wind for formation and continued existence.Upslope and advectionfog,unlike radiationfog,may not burn off with the morning sun but instead can persist for days. They can also extend to greater heights than radiation fog  

Steamfog,orseasmoke,forms when cold,dry air moves over warmwater.As the water evaporates,it rises and resembles smoke.This type of fog is common over bodies of water during the coldest times of the year.Low-level turbulence and icing are commonly associated with steam fog  

Icefog occurs incoldweather when thetemperature is much below freezing and water vapor forms directly into ice crystals.Conditions favorable for its formation are the same as for radiationfog except for cold temperature,usually  $-25$   $\mathrm{{}^{\circ}F}$  or colder. It occurs mostly in the arctic regions but is not unknown in middle latitudes during the cold season.  

# Clouds  

Clouds are visible indicators and are often indicative of future weather.For clouds toform, theremust be adequate watervaporandcondensationnuclei,aswellasamethodby which the air can be cooled.When the air cools and reaches its saturation point,the invisible water vapor changes into a visiblestate.Through the processes of deposition(also referred to as sublimation)and condensation,moisture condensesorsublimatesontominisculeparticlesofmatter likedust,salt,andsmokeknownascondensationnuclei.The nuclei are important because they provide a means for the moisture to change from one state to another.  

Cloud type is determinedby its height,shape,and characteristics.They are classified according to the height of their bases as low, middle, or high clouds, as well as clouds with vertical development.[Figure12-22]  

Low clouds are those that form near the Earth'ssurfaceand extend up to about 6,500feet AGL.They are madeprimarily ofwaterdropletsbutcanincludesupercooledwaterdroplets that induce hazardous aircraft icing. Typical low clouds are stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus. Fog is also classified as a type of low cloud formation.Clouds in this family create low ceilings,hamper visibility,andcanchange rapidly.Becauseof this,they influence flight planning and can make visual flight rules (VFR) flight impossible  

![](images/5579bf050e65dbc97e678695f7ca5dcd72012b2332b495e7dc3671f3b3cfd4d4.jpg)  
Figure 12-22.Basic cloud types.  

Middle clouds form around 6,500feetAGL andextend up to 20,0o0feet AGL.They are composed ofwater,icecrystals and supercooled water droplets.Typical middle-level clouds includealtostratusandaltocumulus.Thesetypesofclouds maybe encountered on cross-country flightsat higher altitudes.Altostratus clouds can produce turbulence and may contain moderate icing. Altocumulus clouds, which usually form when alto stratus clouds are breaking apart,alsomay containlight turbulence and icing.  

Highcloudsform above20,000feetAGL andusuallyform onlyinstable air.They are made up of ice crystals andpose no real threat of turbulence or aircraft icing.Typical high level clouds are cirrus,cirrostratus,and cirrocumulus.  

Clouds with extensive vertical development are cumulus clouds that build vertically into towering cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds.The bases of these clouds form in thelow tomiddle cloud base region but can extendintohigh altitude cloud levels.Towering cumulus clouds indicate areas of instability in the atmosphere, and the air around and inside them is turbulent. These types of clouds often develop into cumulonimbus clouds or thunderstorms.Cumulonimbus clouds contain large amounts of moisture and unstable air and usually produce hazardous weather phenomena,such as lightning, hail, tornadoes, gusty winds, and wind shear. These extensive vertical clouds can be obscured by other cloudformations and arenot always visible from theground or while in flight. When this happens, these clouds are said tobeembedded,hencetheterm,embedded thunderstorms.  

To pilots,the cumulonimbus cloud is perhaps the most dangerous cloud type. It appears individually or in groups and is known as either an air mass or orographic thunderstorm. Heating of the air near the Earth's surface creates an air mass thunderstorm; the upslope motion of air in the mountainous regions causes orographic thunderstorms.Cumulonimbus clouds that form in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands of thunderstorms or squall lines.  

Since rising air currents cause cumulonimbus clouds,they are extremely turbulent and pose a significant hazard toflight safety. For example, if an aircraft enters a thunderstorm, the aircraft could experience updrafts and downdrafts that exceed  $3{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}$  . In addition, thunderstorms can produce large hailstones, damaging lightning, tornadoes, and large quantities of water, all of which are potentially hazardous toaircraft.  

Cloud classification canbefurther broken downinto specific cloud types according to the outward appearance and cloud composition.Knowing these terms canhelp a pilot identify visibleclouds.  

Thefollowing is a list of cloud classifications:  

Cumulus-heaped or piled clouds Stratus—formed inlayers Cirrus——-ringlets, fibrous clouds, also high level clouds above20,000feet Castellanus—commonbase with separate vertical development, castle-like Lenticularus—lens-shaped, formed over mountains in strong winds Nimbus-—-rain-bearingclouds Fracto—-ragged or broken Alto—middle level clouds existing at 5,000 to 20,000 feet  

# Ceiling  

For aviation purposes,a ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds reported as being broken or overcast,or the vertical visibility into an obscura tion like fog or haze.Clouds are reported as broken when five-eighths to seven-eighths of the sky is covered with clouds.Overcast means the entire sky is covered with clouds. Current ceiling information is reported by the aviation routine weather report(METAR)andautomated weather stations of various types.  

# Visibility  

Closelyrelatedtocloudcoverandreportedceilingsis visibility information.Visibility refers to the greatest horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be viewed with the naked eye. Current visibilityis also reported in METAR and other aviation weather reports, as well as by automated weather systems.Visibility information,as predicted by meteorologists,is availablefor apilotduring a preflightweatherbriefing  

# Precipitation  

Precipitation refers to any type of water particlesthat form in the atmosphere and fall to the ground. It has a profound impact onflight safety. Depending on theform of precipitation,it can reduce visibility,create icing situations, and affect landing and takeoff performance of an aircraft.  

Precipitation occurs because water or ice particles in clouds grow in size until the atmosphere can nolonger support them.It can occur in severalforms as it falls toward the Earth, including drizzle, rain,ice pellets,hail, snow,and ice.  

Drizzle is classified as very small water droplets,smaller thanO.o 2 inches in diameter.Drizzle usually accompanies fogorlowstratusclouds.Waterdropletsoflargersizeare referred to as rain.Rain that falls through the atmosphere but evaporates prior to striking the ground is known as virga. Freezing rain and freezing drizzle occur when the temperature of the surface is below freezing;the rain freezes on contact with the cooler surface.  

If rain falls through a temperature inversion, it may freeze as it passes through the underlying cold air and fall to the ground in the form ofice pellets. Icepellets are an indication of a temperature inversion and that freezing rain exists at a higher altitude. In the case of hail, freezing water droplets are carried up and downby drafts inside cumulonimbus clouds, growing larger in size as they come in contact with more moisture. Once the updrafts can no longer hold the freezing water, it falls to the Earth in the form of hail. Hail can be peasized,or it can grow as large as five inches in diameter, larger than asoftball.  

Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that falls at a steady rate or in snow showers that begin, change in intensity, and end rapidly. Snow also varies in size, from very small grains to large flakes.Snowgrains are theequivalent ofdrizzleinsize.  

Precipitation in any form poses a threat to safety of flight Often, precipitation is accompanied by low ceilings and reduced visibility. Aircraft that have ice, snow, or frost on their surfaces must be carefully cleaned prior to beginning a flight because of the possible air flow disruption and loss of lift. Rain can contribute to water in the fuel tanks. Precipitation can create hazards on the runway surface itself making takeoffs and landings difficult, if not impossible. due to snow, ice, or pooling water and very slick surfaces.  

# Air Masses  

Air masses are classified according to the regions where they originate. They are large bodies of air that take on the characteristics of the surrounding area or source region.A source region is typically an area in which the airremains relatively stagnant for a period of days or longer. During this time of stagnation,the air mass takes on the temperature and moisture characteristics of the source region.Areas of stagnation can be found in polar regions, tropical oceans, and dry deserts. Air masses are generally identified as polar or tropical based on temperature characteristics and maritime or continental based on moisture content.  

A continental polar air massforms over apolarregion and brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air masses form over warm tropical waters like the Caribbean Sea and bring warm, moist air. As the air mass moves from its source region andpasses overland orwater,the air mass is subjected to the varying conditions of theland or water which modify the nature of the air mass.[Figure12-23]  

An air masspassing over awarmer surface is warmed from below,and convective currents form,causing the air to rise. This creates an unstable air mass with good surface visibility. Moist,unstable air causes cumulus clouds,showers,and turbulence to form.  

Conversely,an air masspassing over a colder surface does not form convective currents but instead creates as table air mass with poor surface visibility.The poor surface visibility is due to the fact that smoke,dust,and other particles cannot rise outofthe airmass and are instead trapped near thesurface. A stable air mass can produce low stratus clouds and fog  

# Fronts  

As an air mass moves across bodies of water and land, it eventuallycomes in contact with another air mass with different characteristics.The boundary layer between two types of air masses is known as a front. An approaching front of any type always means changes to the weather areimminent.  

There arefour types of fronts that arenamed according tothe temperature of the advancing airrelativeto thetemperature of the air it is replacing: [Figure 12-24]  

Warm Cold Stationary Occluded  

Any discussion of frontal systems must be tempered with the knowledge that no two fronts are the same. However, generalized weather conditions are associated with a specific type of front that helps identify the front.  

# Warm Front  

A warm front occurs when a warm mass of air advances and replaces a body of colder air.Warm fronts move slowly, typically10 to 25 miles per hour(mph).Theslopeofthe advancing front slides over the top of the cooler air and gradually pushes it out of thearea.Warm fronts contain warm air that often has very high humidity.Asthewarm airislifted,the temperature drops and condensation occurs.  

Generally, prior to the passage of a warm front, cirriform or stratiform clouds,along withfog,canbe expected to form along the frontal boundary. In the summer months, cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) are likely to develop.

Symbols for surface fronts and other significant lines shownonthesurfaceanalysischart  

Light to moderate precipitation is probable, usually in the form of rain, sleet, snow, or drizzle, accentuated by poor visibility. The wind blows from the south-southeast,and the outside temperature is cool orcoldwith anincreasingdew point.Finally,as the warm front approaches, the barometric pressure continues to fall until thefrontpasses completely.  

During the passage of a warm front, stratiform clouds are visible and drizzle may be falling. The visibility is generally poor, but improves with variable winds. The temperature rises steadily from the in flow of relatively warmer air.Forthemost part, the dew point remains steady and the pressurelevels off. Afterthepassageofawarmfront,stratocumulusclouds predominate and rain showers are possible.Thevisibility eventually improves,but hazy conditions may exist for a short period after passage. The wind blows from the south- southwest.With warming temperatures,the dewpoint rises and then levels off. There is generally a slight rise in barometric pressure, followed by a decrease of barometric pressure.  

# Flight Toward an Approaching Warm Front  

By studying a typical warm front,much canbe learned about the general patterns and atmospheric conditions that exist when a warm front is encountered in flight Figure12-25 depicts a warm front advancing eastward from St. Louis, Missouri, toward Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during a flight fromPittsburgh toSt. Louis.  

At the time of departure from Pittsburgh, the weatheris good VFR with a scattered layer of cirrus clouds at 15,000feet. As the flight progresses westward toColumbus and closer to the oncoming warm front,the clouds deepen and become increasingly stratiform in appearance with a ceiling of 6,000 feet.The visibility decreases to six miles in hazewith a falling  

![](images/026f6e7d19310a607fd98141e4c2443d1518f4a2b6b5ca539f1058545f458d46.jpg)  
Figure 12-25. Warm front cross-section with surface weather chart depiction and associated METAR.  

barometric pressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather deteriorates to broken clouds at 2.000 feet with three miles visibility and rain. With the temperature and dew point the same, fog is likely to develop.At St. Louis, the sky is overcast withlow clouds and drizzle and the visibility is one mile. Beyond Indianapolis, the ceiling and visibility are too low tocontinueVFR.Therefore,it would be wise to remain in Indianapolisuntilthewarmfrontpasses,whichmaytake uptotwodays.  

# Cold Front  

A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air.  

Cold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, progressing atarateof25to  $30~\mathrm{{mph}}$  .However,extreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at speeds of up to  $60\ \mathrm{mph}$  A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that of a warm front. It is so dense,it stays close to the ground and actslikeasnowplow,slidingunderthewarmerairand forcing the less dense air aloft. The rapidly ascending air causes the temperature to decrease suddenly,forcingthe creation of clouds. The type of clouds that form depends on the stability of the warmer air mass.Acoldfrontinthe Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented in a northeast to southwest manner and can be several hundred miles long, encompassing a large area of land.  

Prior to the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform or towering cumulus clouds are present,and cumulonimbus clouds may develop. Rain showers may also develop due to the rapid development of clouds.A high dew point and falling barometric pressure are indicative of imminent cold frontpassage.  

As the cold front passes,towering cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds continue to dominate the sky. Depending on the intensity of the cold front,heavy rain showersform and may be accompanied by lightning, thunder, and/or hail. More severe cold fronts can also produce tornadoes.Duringcold front passage, the visibility is poor with winds variable and gusty, and the temperature and dew point drop rapidly. A quickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out during frontal passage,thenbegins a gradual increase.  

After frontal passage,the towering cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds begin to dissipate to cumulus clouds with a corresponding decrease in the precipitation.Good visibility eventually prevails with the winds from thewest- northwest.Temperatures remain cooler and the barometric pressure continues to rise.  

# Fast-MovingColdFront  

Fast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure systems far behind the actual front.The friction between theground and the cold front retards the movement of the front and creates a steeper frontal surface. This results in a very narrow band of weather, concentrated along theleading edge of the front.If the warm air being overtaken by the cold front is relatively stable, overcast skies and rain may occur for some distance behind the front. If the warm air is unstable, scattered thunderstorms and rain showers may form. A continuous line of thunderstorms, or squall line, may form along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present a serious hazard to pilots as squall-type thunderstorms are intense and move quickly. Behind a fast-moving cold front, the skies usually clear rapidly, and the front leaves behind gusty, turbulent winds and colder temperatures.  

# Flight Toward an Approaching Cold Front  

Like warm fronts, not all cold fronts are the same. Examining a flight toward an approaching cold front, pilots can get a better understanding of thetypeof conditions that can be encountered in flight. Figure 12-26 depicts a flight from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, toward St. Louis,Missouri.  

At the time of departure from Pittsburgh,theweatherisVFR with three miles visibility in smoke and a scattered layer of clouds at 3,500 feet. As the flight progresses westward to Columbus and closer to the oncoming cold front, the clouds show signs of vertical development with a broken layer at 2,500 feet. The visibility is six miles in haze with a falling barometric pressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather has deteriorated to overcast clouds at 1,ooo feet and three miles visibility with thunderstorms and heavy rain showers. AtSt.Louis,the weather gets better with scattered clouds at 1,0oofeet and a ten milevisibility.  

A pilot using sound judgment based on the knowledge of frontal conditions willlikely remain in Indianapolis until the front has passed. Trying to fly below a line of thunderstorms or a squall line is hazardous, and flight over the top of or around the storm is not an option. Thunderstorms can extend uptowell over the capability of small airplanes and can extend in alinefor300 to500miles.  

# Comparisonof Cold and Warm Fronts  

Warm fronts and cold fronts are very different in nature as are the hazards associated with each front. They vary in speed, composition, weather phenomenon, and prediction.Cold fronts, whichmoveat20to  $35~\mathrm{mph}$  ,travelfaster thanwarmfronts, which move at only 10 to  $25\;\mathrm{mph}$  .Cold fronts alsopossess a

Figure12-26.Coldfrontcross-section with surface weather chart depiction and associated META R.  

steeper frontal slope.Violent weather activity is associated with coldfronts,and the weather usually occurs along the frontal boundary,notinadvance.However,squall lines can form during the summer months as far as 2 o 0 miles in advance of a strong cold front. Whereas warm fronts bring low ceilings, poor visibility, and rain, cold fronts bring sudden storms,gusty winds,turbulence,and sometimes hail or tornadoes.  

Cold fronts are fast approaching with little or no warning, andtheybringaboutacompleteweatherchangeinjusta few hours.The weather clears rapidly after passage and drier air with unlimited visibilities prevail.Warmfronts, on the otherhand,provide advance warning of their approach and can take days to pass through a region  

# Wind Shifts  

Wind around a high-pressure system rotates clockwise,while low-pressurewindsrotatecounter-clockwise.Whentwo high pressure systems are adjacent, the winds are almost in direct opposition to each other at thepoint of contact.Fronts are the boundaries between two areas of high pressure,and therefore,wind shifts are continually occurring within a front Shifting wind direction is most pronounced in conjunction withcoldfronts.  

# StationaryFront  

When the forces of two air masses are relatively equal, the boundary or front that separates them remains stationary and influences the local weather for days.This front is called a stationaryfront.The weather associated with a stationary front is typically a mixture that canbefound inbothwarm andcoldfronts.  

# Occluded Front  

An occluded front occurs when a fast-movingcoldfront catches up with a slow-moving warm front.As the occluded front approaches,warm front weather prevails but is immediately followed by cold front weather.Therearetwo types of occluded fronts that can occur, and the temperatures of the colliding frontal systems play a largepart in defining the type of front and the resulting weather.Acoldfront occlusion occurs when a fast moving cold front is colder than the air ahead of the slow moving warm front.When thisoccurs,thecold air replaces the cool air andforcesthe warm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the cold front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found in both warm andcoldfronts,providingthe air is relatively stable A warm front occlusion occurs when the air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of the cold front.Whenthis isthecase,the cold front rides up and over the warm front.If the air forced aloft by the warm front occlusion is unstable, the weather is more severe than the weather found in a cold frontocclusion.Embedded thunderstorms,rain,andfogare likelytooccur.  

Figure12-27depicts a cross-sectionof atypicalcold front occlusion. The warm front slopes over the prevailing cooler air and produces the warm front type weather. Prior to the passage of the typical occluded front,cirriformand stratiform clouds prevail, light to heavy precipitation falls, visibilityis poor,dewpointis steady,and barometric pressure drops. During the passage of the front, nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds predominate, and towering cumulus clouds may also form. Light to heavy precipitation falls, visibility is poor, winds are variable, and the barometric pressure levels off.After the passage of the front,nimbostratus and altostratus clouds are visible, precipitation decreases, and visibility improves.  

# Thunderstorms  

A thunderstorm makes its way through three distinct stages before dissipating.It begins with the cumulus stage,in which lifting action of the air begins.If sufficient moisture and instability are present,the clouds continue to increase in vertical height. Continuous, strong updrafts prohibit moisture from falling. Within approximately 15 minutes, the thunderstorm reaches the mature stage,whichisthemost violent time period of the thunderstorm's life cycle. At this point, drops of moisture, whether rain or ice, are too heavy for the cloud to support and begin falling in the form of rain orhail.This creates a downward motion of the air.Warm, rising air; cool, precipitation-induced descending air; and violent turbulence all exist within and near the cloud.Below thecloud,thedown-rushing air increases surface winds and decreases the temperature. Once the vertical motion near the top of the cloud slows down,the top of the cloud spreads out and takes on an anvil-likeshape.Atthispoint,thestorm enters the dissipating stage.This is when the downdrafts spread out and replace the updrafts needed to sustain the storm.[Figure12-28]  

It is impossible to fly over thunderstorms in light aircraft. Severe thunderstorms can punch through the tropopause and reach staggering heights of 50,000 to60,000feet depending onlatitude.Flyingunder thunderstorms can subject aircraft to rain, hail, damaging lightning, and violent turbulence. A good rule of thumbis to circumnavigate thunderstorms identified as severe or giving an extreme radar echo by at

least 20 nautical miles (NM) since hail may fall for miles outside of the clouds. If flying around a thunderstorm is not an option,stay on theground until it passes.  

Forathunderstormtoform,the airmusthavesufficientwater vapor, an unstable lapse rate, and an initial lifting action to start thestormprocess.Somestormsoccur atrandomin unstable air, last for only an hour or two, and produce only moderate wind gusts and rainfall. These are known as air mass thunderstorms and are generally a result of surface heating.Steady-state thunderstorms are associated with weather systems. Fronts, converging winds, and troughs aloft force upward motionspawning thesestorms that often form into squall lines. In the mature stage, updrafts become stronger andlast muchlonger thanin air mass storms,hence the name steady state.[Figure12-29]  

Knowledge of thunderstorms and the hazards associated with them is critical to thesafety of flight  

# Hazards  

All thunderstorms have conditions that are a hazard to aviation. These hazards occur in numerous combinations.Whilenot every thunderstorm contains all hazards, it is not possible to visually determine which hazards a thunderstorm contains.  

# Squall Line  

A squall line is a narrow band of active thunderstorms.Often it develops on or ahead of a cold front in moist, unstable air, but it may develop in unstable air far removed from any front. The line may be toolong to detour easily and too wide andsevere topenetrate.It often containssteady-state thunderstorms and presents the single most intense weather hazard to aircraft. It usually forms rapidly, generally reaching maximum intensity during the late afternoon and the first few hours of darkness.  

# Tornadoes  

The most violent thunderstorms draw air into their cloud bases withgreat vigor.If theincoming air has any initial rotating motion, it often forms an extremely concentrated vortex from the surface well into the cloud. Meteorologists have estimated that wind in such a vortex can exceed 200 knots with pressure inside the vortex quite low. The strong winds gather dust and debris and the low pressure generates afunnel-shaped cloud extending downward from the cumulonimbus base.If the cloud does not reach the surface, itis a funnel cloud;ifittouches aland surface,itis a tornado; and if it touches water, it is a “waterspout."  

![](images/d47bf3ce8b73bbd855a6223c900a189d9b97a2e7ccc5422bc55416acd8f342e4.jpg)  
Figure12-29.Movement and turbulence of a maturing thunderstorm  

Tornadoes occur with both isolated and squall line thunderstorms. Reports for forecasts of tornadoes indicate that atmospheric conditions are favorable for violent turbulence. An aircraft entering a tornado vortex is almost certain to sufferloss ofcontrol and structural damage.Since the vortex extends well into the cloud, any pilot inadvertently caught oninstruments ina severe thunderstorm could encounter a hidden vortex.  

Familiesof tornadoes have been observed as appendages of themain cloud extending several miles outward from the area of lightning and precipitation. Thus,any cloud connected to a severe thunderstorm carries a threat ofviolence.  

# Turbulence  

Potentially hazardous turbulence ispresent inall thunderstorms, and a severe thunderstorm can destroy an aircraft. Strongest turbulence within the cloud occurs with shear between updrafts and downdrafts.Outsidethecloud, shear turbulence has been encountered several thousand feet above and 20 miles laterally from a severe storm. A low-level turbulent area is the shear zone associated with the gust front. Often, a“roll cloud"on the leading edge of a storm marks the topoftheeddiesinthisshear,anditsignifiesanextremely turbulent zone. Gust fronts often move far ahead (up to 15 miles)of associated precipitation.The gust front causes a rapid, and sometimes drastic, change in surface wind ahead of an approaching storm.Advisory Circular(AC)00-54,Pilot Windshear Guide,explains gust front hazards associatedwith thunderstorms.Figure 2 in the AC shows a cross section of a mature stage thunderstorm with agust front area where very serious turbulence may be encountered.  

# Icing  

Updrafts in a thunderstorm support abundant liquid water with relatively large droplet sizes.When carried above the freezing level,the water becomes supercooled.When temperature in the upward current cools to about  $-15\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  much of the remaining water vapor sublimates asice crystals. Above this level,at lower temperatures, the amount of supercooled water decreases.  

Supercooled water freezes on impact with an aircraft.Clear icingcanoccur atany altitude above the freezing level,but at high levels, icing from smaller droplets may be rime or mixed rimeandclearice.The abundance of large,supercooled water droplets makes clear icing very rapid between  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $-15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and encounters can be frequent in a cluster ofcells Thunderstorm icing can be extremely hazardous.  

Thunderstorms are not the only area where pilots could encounter icing conditions. Pilots should be alert for icing anytime the temperature approaches  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and visible moisture ispresent.  

# Engine Water Ingestion  

Hail competes with turbulence as the greatest thunderstorm hazard to aircraft.Supercooled drops above the freezing level begin to freeze. Once a drop has frozen, other drops latch on and freeze to it, so the hailstone grows—sometimes into a hugeiceball.Large hail occurs with severe thunderstorms with strong updrafts that have built to great heights. Eventually, the hailstones fall,possibly some distance from the storm core. Hail may be encountered in clear air several miles from thunderstorm clouds.  

Ashailstonesfallthroughairwhosetemperatureisabove0  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  , they begin to melt and precipitation may reach the ground aseitherhailorrain.Rainatthesurfacedoesnotmeanthe absence of hail aloft.Possible hail should be anticipated with any thunderstorm, especially beneath the anvil of a large cumulonimbus.Hailstones larger than one-halfinch in diameter can significantly damage an aircraft in a few seconds.  

# Ceiling andVisibility  

Generally,visibility is near zero within a thunderstorm cloud.Ceilingand visibility alsomaybe restricted in precipitation and dust between the cloud base and the ground. The restrictions create the same problem as all ceiling and visibility restrictions;but the hazards are multiplied when associated with the other thunderstorm hazards of turbulence, hail, and lightning  

Turbine engines have a limit on the amount of water they can ingest. Updrafts are present in many thunderstorms, particularly those in the developing stages. If the updraft velocity in the thunderstorm approaches or exceeds the terminal velocity of thefalling raindrops,very high concentrations of water may occur. It is possible that these concentrations canbe in excess of the quantity of water turbine engines are designed to ingest. Therefore, severe thunderstorms may contain areas of high water concentration, which could result inflame out and/or structural failure of one or more engines.  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of the atmosphere and the forces acting within ittocreateweatherisessentialtounderstandhowweather affects a flight. By understanding basic weather theories, a pilot canmake sound decisions during flight planning after receiving weather briefings.For additional information on the topics discussed in this chapter, see the following publications asamended:AC00-6,Aviation Weather For Pilots and Flight Operations Personnel; AC 00-24, Thunderstorms; AC 00-45, Aviation Weather Services;AC91-74,PilotGuide:Flightin IcingConditions; and chapter 7,section 2of theAeronautical Information Manual (AIM)  

# Effect on Altimeters  

Pressure usually falls rapidly with the approach of a thunderstorm,rises sharply with the onset of the first gust and arrival of the cold downdraft and heavy rain showers, and then falls back to normal as the storm moves on.This cycle of pressure change may occurin15 minutes. If the pilot does notreceive a corrected altimeter setting,the altimeter may be more than 1o0feet in error.  

# Lightning  

Alightning strike can puncture the skin of an aircraft and damage communications and electronic navigational equipment. Although lightning has been suspected of igniting fuel vapors and causing an explosion, serious accidents due to lightning strikes are rare. Nearby lightning can blind the pilot, rendering him or her momentarily unable to navigate either by instrument or by visual reference. Nearby lightning can also induce permanent errors in the magnetic compass. Lightning discharges,even distant ones, can disrupt radio communications on low and medium frequencies. Though lightning intensity and frequency have no simple relationship to other storm parameters, severe storms, as a rule, have a highfrequency oflightning.  

# Chapter 13 Aviation Weather  

# Introduction  

Inaviation,weather service isa combinedeffort ofthe National Weather Service (NWS),Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),Departmentof Defense (DOD),other aviation groups, and individuals. Because of the increasing need for worldwide weather services,foreign weather organizations also provide vital input.  

While weather forecasts are not 1o0 percent accurate. meteorologists,through careful scientific study and computer modeling, have the ability to predict weather patterns, trends. and characteristics with increasing accuracy. Through complex system of weather services, government agencies, and independent weather observers, pilots and other aviation professionals receive the benefit of this vast knowledge base in the form of up-to-date weather reports and forecasts. These reports and forecasts enable pilots to make informed decisions regarding weather and flight safety before and during a flight.

# Observations  

The data gathered from surface and upper altitude observations form the basis of all weather forecasts, advisories, and briefings. There are four types of weather observations: surface, upper air, radar, and satellite.  

# Surface Aviation Weather Observations  

Surface aviation weather observations(METARs)area compilation of elements of the current weather at individual ground stations across theUnited States.The network is made upof government and privately contracted facilities that provide continuous up-to-date weather information. Automatedweathersources,suchastheAutomatedWeatherObserving Systems(AWOS),Automated Surface Observing Systems (AsOS),as well as other automated facilities,also play a major rolein thegathering of surface observations.  

Surface observations provide local weather conditions and other relevant information for a specific airport. This information includes the type of report, station identifier, date and time,modifier(as required),wind,visibility, runway visual range(RVR),weather phenomena,sky condition, temperature/dew point, altimeter reading, and applicable remarks. Theinformation gathered for the surface observation may be from a person, an automated station, or an automated station that isupdated or enhancedby a weather observer. In any form, the surface observation provides valuable information aboutindividual airports around the country. Although the reports cover only a small radius, the pilotcangenerateagoodpictureoftheweatheroverawide area when many reporting stations a reviewed together.  

# Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)  

The Air Route Traffic Control Center(ARTCC)facilities areresponsible for maintaining separation between flights conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR) in the en routestructure.Centerradars(Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR)) acquire and track transponder returns using the same basic technology as terminal radars.Earlier center radars displayed weather as an area of slashes (light precipitation) and Hs (moderate rainfall). Because the controller could not detect higher levels of precipitation, pilots had to be wary of areas showing moderate rainfall.Newer radar displays show weather as three shades of blue.Controllers can select the level of weather to be displayed.Weather displays of higher levels of intensity make it difficult for controllers to see aircraft data blocks,so pilots should not expect air traffic control (ATC) tokeep weather displayed continuously  

# Upper Air Observations  

Observations of upper air weather are more challenging than surface observations. There are several methods by which upper air weather phenomena can be observed:  

radiosonde observations, pilot weather reports (PIREPs), Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay(AMDAR）and the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS).A radios on de is a small cubic instrumentation package that is suspended below a six foot hydrogen- or helium-filledballoon.Oncereleased,the balloon rises at a rate of approximately 1,0o0 feet per minute (fpm). As it ascends. the instrumentation gathers various pieces of data, such as air temperature,moisture,andpressure,aswell as windspeed and direction. Once the information is gathered, it is relayed toground stationsvia a 300 milliwatt radio transmitter.  

The balloon flight can last as long as 2 hours or more and can ascend to altitudes as high as 115,000 feet and drift as far as 125 miles. The temperatures and pressures experienced during the flight can be as low as  $-130\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  andpressures as lowas afewthousandths ofwhatis experienced at sea level.  

Since the pressure decreases as the balloon rises in the atmosphere, the balloon expands until it reaches the limits ofitselasticity.This point is reached when the diameterhas increased to over 20 feet.Atthispoint,the balloon pops and the radios on de falls back to Earth.The descent is slowed by means of a parachute. The parachute aids in protecting people and objects on the ground.Eachyearover75,000balloons are launched. Of that number, 20 percent are recovered and returned for reconditioning. Return instructions are printed on the side of each radios on de  

Pilots also provide vital information regarding upper air weather observations and remain the only real-timesource of information regarding turbulence, icing, and cloud heights. This information is gathered and filed by pilots in flight. Together, PIREPs and radiosonde observations provide information on upper air conditions important for flight planning. Many domestic and international airlines have equipped their aircraft with instrumentation that automatically transmits in flight weather observations through the Data Link system.  

The Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay(AMDAR） is an international program utilizing commercial aircraft to provide automated weather observations.TheAMDAR program provides approximately 220,000-230,000 aircraft observationsper dayon a worldwide basis utilizing aircraft onboard sensors and probes that measure wind, temperature, humidity/watervapor,turbulence and icing data.AMDAR vertical profiles and en route observations provide significant benefits to the aviation community by enhancing aircraft safety and operating efficiency through improved weather analysis and forecasting.The AMDAR program also contributes toimproved short and medium term numerical weather forecastsfor awide range of services including severeweather,defense,marine,public weather and environmental monitoring. The information is down linked either via Very High Frequency（VHF）communications through the Aircraft Communications Addressing and ReportingSystem(ACARS)orvia satellitelink through the Aircraft to Satellite Data Acquisition andRelay(ASDAR)  

The Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS)is an automated airborne weather observation program that is used in the U.S. This program collects and disseminates real-time upper-air weather observations from participating airlines. The weather elements are down linked via A CARS and are managed by Aeronautical Radio,Inc. (ARINC)who then forwards them in Binary Universal Form for the Representation of Meteorological Data (BUFR) format to theNwS and in raw dataform to theEarthScience Research Laboratory (ESRL) and the participating airline. More than 1,5o0 aircraft report wind and temperature data with some of these same aircraft also providing turbulence andhumidity/water vapor information.In conjunction with avionics manufacturers, each participating airline programs their equipment toprovide certainlevels of meteorological data.Themonitoring and collection of climb,enroute,and descent datais accomplished through the aircraft's Flight Data Acquisition and Monitoring System (FDAMS) and is then transmittedviaACARS.WhenaircraftareoutofACARS range, reports can be relayed through ASDAR. However, in most cases, the reports are buffered until the aircraft comes within ACARS range, at which point they are downloaded.  

# Radar Observations  

There are four types of radars which provide information about precipitation and wind  

TheWSR-88DNEXRADradar,commonlycalled Doppler radar, provides in-depth observations that inform surrounding communities of impending weather. Doppler radar has two operational modes: clear air and precipitation.Inclearairmode,theradar is in its most sensitive operational mode because a slow antenna rotation allowstheradar tosample the atmosphere longer.Images are updated about every 10minutesinthismode.  

Precipitation targets provide stronger return signals: therefore, the radar is operated in the Precipitation mode when precipitation ispresent.Afaster antenna rotation in thismode allowsimages toupdate at a faster rate, approximately every 4 to 6 minutes. Intensity values in both modes are measured in dBZ (decibels of Z) and are depicted in color on the radar image.[Figure 13-1] Intensities are correlated to intensity terminology(phraseology）for ATC purposes.[Figures13-2and13-3]

2. FAA terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR), installed at some major airports around the country, also aids in providing severe weather alerts and warningstoATC.Terminal radar ensures pilots are aware of wind shear, gust fronts, and heavy precipitation, all of which are dangerous to arriving and departing aircraft. 3. The third type of radar commonly used in the detection of precipitation is the FAA airport surveillance radar This radar is used primarily to detect aircraft, but it alsodetects thelocation and intensity of precipitation, which is used to route aircraft traffic around severe weather in an airport environment. 4 Airborne radar is equipment carried by aircraft to generallyoperateintheCor  $\mathrm{X}$  bands(around6 GHz or around  $10\ \mathrm{GHz}$  ,respectively)permitting both penetration of heavy precipitation, required for determining the extent of thunderstorms,andsufficient reflection from less intense precipitation  

# Satellite  

Advancement in satellite technologies has recently allowed for commercial use to include weather uplinks. Through the use of satellite subscription services,individuals are now able to receive satellite transmitted signals that provide near real- time weather information for theNorth American continent.  

# Service Outlets  

Service outlets are government,government contract,or private facilities that provide aviation weather services.Several different government agencies, including the FAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA),andthe NWS work in conjunction with private aviation companies to provide different means of accessing weather information.  

# Flight Service Station (FSS)  

TheFSSistheprimarysourceforpreflightweather information.A pre flight weather briefing from a nFS S can be obtained24hoursadaybycalling1-800-WXBRIEFfrom anywhere in the United States and PuertoRico.Telephone numbers for FS S can be found in the Chart Supplement U.S (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) or in the United States Government section of the telephone book  

The FSS also provides inflight weather briefing services and weather advisories to flights within the FS S area of responsibility.  

# Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS)  

TheTelephoneInformationBriefingService(TIBS) provided by FSS,is a system of automated telephone recordings of meteorological and aeronautical information. TIBS provides area and route briefings, airspace procedures, and special announcements. The recordings are automatically updated as changes occur. It is designed to be a preliminary briefing tool and is not intended to replace a standard briefing from a FSSspecialist.The TIBS service can only be accessed by a touchtone phone. The phone numbers for the TIBS service are listed in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory)  

# Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS)  

Hazardous In flight Weather Advisory Service(HIWAS) availableinthe48conterminousstates,isanautomated continuous broadcast of hazardous weather information over selected VOR navigational aids (NAVAIDs).The broadcasts include advisories such as AIR METS,SIGMETS, convective SIG METS,andurgentPIREPs.Thebroadcasts are automatically updated as changes occur. Pilots should contact aFSS orEFAS for additional information.VORs that have HI WAS capability are depicted on aeronautical charts with an “H" in the upper right corner of the identification box.[Figure13-4]

in the Alaska Chart Supplement U.S.(formerly Airport) Facility Directory).Thesebroadcasts aremade available primarily for preflight and inflight planning, and as such, should not be considered as a substitute for specialist- provided preflight briefings.  

# Weather Briefings  

Prior toeveryflight,pilots should gather allinformation vital to the nature of the flight. This includes an appropriate weatherbriefingobtainedfromaspecialistataFSS  

For weather specialists to provide an appropriate weather briefing,they need to know which of the three types of briefings is needed standard,abbreviated,oroutlook.Other helpful information iswhether the flight is visual flight rules (VFR) or IFR,aircraft identification and type,departure point, estimated time of departure (ETD),flight altitude,route of flight,destination,and estimated time en route(ETE)  

This information is recorded in the flight plan system and a note is made regarding the type of weather briefing provided. If necessary, it can be referenced later to file or amend a flight plan. It is also used when an aircraft is overdue or is reportedmissing.  

# Standard Briefing  

A standard briefing provides themost complete information and a more complete weather picture.This type of briefing should be obtained prior to thedepartureof anyflightand should be used during flight planning. A standard briefing provides the following information in sequential order if it is applicable to the route of flight.  

Adverse conditions-this includes information about adverse conditions that may influence a decision to cancel or alter the route of flight.Adverse conditions include significant weather, such as thunderstorms or aircraft icing, or other important items such as airport closings. 2. VFR flight not recommended if the weather for the routeof flight isbelowVFR minimums,or if it is doubtful the flight could be made under VFR conditions due to the forecast weather,thebriefer may state "VFR flight not recommended." It is the pilot's decision whether or not to continue the flight under VFR,but this advisory should beweighed carefully. 3. Synopsisan overview of thelarger weather picture. Fronts and major weather systems that affect the general area areprovided. 4. Current conditions—the current ceilings, visibility, winds, and temperatures. If the departure time is more than 2 hours away, current conditions are not included in the briefing.  

5. En routeforecastasummary of theweatherforecast for the proposed route of flight. 6. Destination forecast a summary of the expected weather for the destination airport at the estimated time of arrival (ETA). 7. Forecast winds and temperatures aloft—a forecast of the winds at specific altitudes for the route of flight. The forecast temperature information aloft is provided onlyuponrequest. 8. Notices to Airmen(NOTAM)—information pertinent to the route of flight that has not been published in the NOT AM publication.Published NOT AM information is provided during the briefing only when requested. 9. ATC delays-an advisory of anyknown ATC delays that may affect the flight. 10. Other information—at the end of the standard briefing the FS S specialist provides the radio frequencies needed to open a flight plan and to contact EFAS.Any additional information requested is alsoprovided at thistime.  

# Abbreviated Briefing  

An abbreviated briefing is a shortened version of the standard briefing. It should be requested when a departure has been delayed or when weather information is needed to update the previous briefing. When this is the case, the weather specialistneeds toknow the time and source of theprevious briefing so the necessary weather information is not omitted inadvertently.It is always a good idea for the pilot to update the weather information whenever he/she has additional time.  

# Outlook Briefing  

An outlook briefing should be requested when a planned departure is 6 hours or more away. It provides initial forecast information that is limited in scope due to the timeframe of the planned flight. This type of briefing is a good source of flight planning information that can influence decisions regarding route of flight, altitude, and ultimately the go/no-go decision. A prudent pilot requests a follow-up briefing prior to departure since an outlook briefing generally only contains informationbasedonweathertrendsandexistingweatherin geographical areas at or near the departure airport. A standard briefingnear the time of departure ensures that the pilot has the latest information available prior to his/her flight.  

# AviationWeather Reports  

Aviationweather reports are designed to give accurate depictions of current weather conditions.Eachreport provides current information that is updated atdifferent times. Some typical reports are METARs andPIREPs.  

# Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)  

AMET ARis an observation of current surface weather reported in a standard international format.Whilethe META R code has been adopted worldwide,eachcountryis allowed to make modifications to the code.Normally,these differences are minor but necessary to accommodate local procedures or particular units of measure.This discussion of META R covers elements used in the United States.  

METARs are issued on a regularly scheduled basis unless significant weather changes have occurred.Aspecial METAR(SPECI)can be issued at anytime between routine METARreports.  

Example: MET ARK GG G 161753 Z AUTO 14021 G 26 KT 3/4SM  $+\dot{}$  TSRABRBKN008OVC012CB18/17A2970RMK PRESFR  

A typical METAR report contains the following information in sequential order:  

Type of report there are two types of META R reports. The first is the routine METAR report that is transmittedonaregular timeinterval.Thesecondis the aviation selected SPECI. This is a special report that canbe given at any time to update theMETAR for rapidlychanging weather conditions,aircraft mishaps Or other critical information.  

2.S Station identifier-afour-letter code as established by the International Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO) In the 48 contiguous states, a unique three-letter identifier is preceded by the letter "K."For example. Gregg County Airport in Longview，Texas,is identified by the letters “KGGG,”K being the country designation and GG G being the airport identifier. In other regions of the world, including Alaska and Hawaii, the first two letters of the four-letter ICAO identifier indicate the region, country, or state. Alaska identifiers always begin with the letters“PA"and Hawaii identifiers always begin with the letters"PH." Station identifiers can be found by calling the FS S,a NWS office,or by searching various websites such asDUATSandNOAA's Aviation Weather Aviation DigitalDataServices(ADDS)  

3. Date and time of reportdepicted in a six-digit group (161753Z).Thefirst two digits are the date.Thelast four digits are the time of theME TAR/SPECI,which is always given in coordinated universal time (UTC). A “Z"is appended to the end of the time to denote the time is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed to localtime.  

4. Modifier denotes that theME TAR/SPECIcamefrom an automated source or that the report was corrected. If the notation“AUTO"is listed in the METAR/SPECI, the report came from an automated source.Italsolists “AO1"(for no precipitation discriminator) or“AO2" (with precipitation discriminator) in the “Remarks" section to indicate the type of precipitation sensors employed at the automated station.  

When the modifier “COR"is used,it identifies a corrected report sent out to replace an earlier report that contained an error (for example: METAR KGGG 161753ZCOR).  

5. Wind—reported with five digits(14021KT) unless the speed is greater than 99 knots,inwhichcasethe wind is reported with six digits. The first three digits indicatethe direction the truewindis blowingfrom in tensofdegrees.If the wind is variable,itisreported as"VRB."Thelast two digits indicate the speed of the wind in knots unless the wind is greater than99 knots, in which case it is indicated by three digits. If the winds are gusting, the letter “G' follows the wind speed (G26KT). After the letter “G," the peak gust recorded is provided.If the wind direction varies more than  $60^{\circ}$  and the wind speed is greater than six knots, a separate group of numbers,separatedbya"V,”will indicate the extremes of the wind directions.  

6. Visibility-the prevailing visibility  $\sqrt[3]{4}$  SM)isreported in statute miles as denoted by theletters“SM."It is reported in both miles and fractions of miles. At times, runway visual range (RVR) is reported following the prevailing visibility. RVR is the distance a pilot can see down the runwayin a moving aircraft.When RVR is reported, it is shown with an R, then the runway number followed by a slant, then the visual range in feet.For example,when the RVR is reported as R17L/1400FT, it translates to a visual range of 1,400 feet on runway 17 left  

7. Weather—canbebrokendownintotwodifferent categories:qualifiers and weather phenomenon  $^+$  TSRA BR).First, the qualifiers of intensity, proximity, and the descriptor of the weather are given. The intensity may be light  $(-)$  ,moderate (),orheavy  $(+)$  .Proximity only depicts weather phenomena that are in the airport vicinity. The notation"VC" indicates a specific weather phenomenon is in the vicinity of five to ten miles from the airport. Descriptors are used to describe certain types of precipitation andobscurations.Weather phenomena maybe reportedasbeing precipitation,obscurations,and other phenomena, such as squalls or funnel clouds. Descriptions of weather phenomena as theybegin or end and hailstone size are alsolistedin the“Remarks' sections of the report.[Figure13-5]  

8. Sky condition—always reported in the sequence of amount, height, and type or indefinite ceiling/height (vertical visibility）(BKN008OVC012CB,VV003). The heights of the cloud bases are reported with a three-digit number in hundreds of feet AGL. Clouds above12,000feet arenot detected or reportedby an automated station. The types of clouds, specifically towering cumulus (TCU) or cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, are reported with their height. Contractions are used to describe the amount of cloud coverage and obscuring phenomena.The amount ofsky coverageis reported in eighths of the sky from horizon to horizon. [Figure13-6]  

Temperature and dew point—the air temperature and dew point are always given in degrees Celsius (C) or (18/17).Temperatures below  $0\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  areprecededby the letter “M" to indicate minus.  

10. Altimeter setting—reported as inches of mercury  $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  in a four-digit number group (A2970). It is always preceded by the letter“A."Rising orfalling pressure may also be denoted in the “Remarks' sections as"PRESRR"or"PRESFR,”respectively.  

11. Zulu timea term used in aviation for UTC, which places the entire world on one time standard.

12.Remarksthe remarks section always begins with the letters "RMK."Comments may or may not appear in this section of theME TAR.The information contained in this section may include wind data,variable visibility, beginning and ending times of particular phenomenon, pressure information, and various other information deemed necessary.An example of a remark regarding weather phenomenon that does not fit in any other category would be: OCNL LTGICCG. This translates as occasional lightning in the clouds and from cloud to ground.Automated stations also use theremarks section toindicate the equipment needs maintenance.

# Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)  

PIREPsprovidevaluableinformationregardingthe conditions as they actually exist in the air,whichcannotbe gathered from any other source. Pilots can confirm the height of bases and tops of clouds,locations of winds hear and turbulence, and the location of inflight icing. If the ceiling is below 5,000 feet, or visibility is at or below five miles,ATC facilities are required to solicit PIREPs from pilots in the area. When unexpected weather conditions are encountered, pilots are encouraged to make a report to a FSS or ATC.When a pilot weather report is filed, the ATC facility or FSS adds it to the distribution system to brief other pilots and provide in flight advisories.  

PIR EPs are easy to file and a standard reporting form outlines the mannerin which they should befiled.Figure13-7shows the elements of a PIREP form.Item numbers1 through5 are required information when making a report,aswellas atleast oneweather phenomenon encountered.A PIREPis normally transmitted as anindividual report but maybe appended to a surface report. Pilot reports are easily decoded, and most contractions used in the reports are self-explanatory.

# Aviation Forecasts  

Observed weather condition reports are often used in the creation of forecasts for the same area.A variety of different forecast products are produced and designed to be used in the preflight planning stage. The printed forecasts that pilots need to be familiar with are the terminal aerodrome forecast(TAF), aviation area forecast(FA),in flight weather advisories (SIGMET,AIRMET),andthewindsandtemperaturesaloft forecast(FB).  

# Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts(TAF)  

AT A Fisa report established for the five statute mile radius around an airport. TAF reports are usually given for larger airports.Each TAF is valid for a 24or30-hour time period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z,and1800Z.The TAF utilizes the same descriptors and abbreviations as used in theME TAR report.TheTAF includes the following information in sequential order:  

1. Type of report—a TAF can be either a routine forecast (TAF)or an amended forecast (TAF AMD) 2.ICAO station identifier—the station identifier is the same as that used i naME TAR. 3. Date and time of origin—time and date (081125Z) of TAF origination is given in the six-number code with the first twobeing the date, the last four being the time. Time is always given in UTC as denoted by the Z following the time block. 4. Valid period dates and times—The TAF valid period (0812/0912)followsthedate/time of forecast origin group. Scheduled 24 and 30 hour TAFs are issued four times per day, at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800Z. The first two digits (O8) are the day of the month for the start of the TAF. The next two digits (12) are the starting hour (UTC). O9 is the day of the month for the end of the TAF, and the last two digits (12) are theendinghour(UTC)of the valid period.Aforecast period that begins at midnight UTC is annotated as O0. If the end time of a valid period is at midnight UTC, it is annotated as 24.Forexample,aO0ZTAFissued on the 9th of the month and valid for 24 hours would have a valid period of 0900/0924. 5.Forecast wind—the wind direction and speed forecast are coded in a five-digit number group. An example would be 15011KT. The first three digits indicate the direction of the wind in reference to true north. The last two digits state the windspeed in knots appended with “KT." Like the METAR, winds greater than 99 knots are given in three digits. 6. Forecast visibility——given in statute miles and may be in whole numbers or fractions. If the forecast is greater than six miles, it is coded as “P6SM."  

Forecast significant weather—weather phenomena are coded in the TAF reports in the same format as theMETAR 8. Forecast sky condition—given in the same format as the METAR.Only cumulonimbus(CB)clouds are forecast in this portion of the TAF report as opposed to CBs and towering cumulus in theME TAR. 9. Forecast change group——for any significant weather changeforecast tooccur duringtheTAF timeperiod, the expected conditions and time period are included in this group. This information may be shown as from (FM), and temporary (TEMPO). "FM" is used when a capid and significant change, usually within an hour, is expected."TEMPO"is used for temporary fluctuations of weather, expected to last less than 1 hour. 10. PROB30—a given percentage that describes the probability of thunderstorms and precipitation occurring in the coming hours. This forecast is not used for the first 6 hours of the 24-hour forecast.

# AreaForecasts(FA)  

The FA gives a picture of clouds,general weather conditions, and visual meteorological conditions(VMC)expectedover a large area encompassing several states.There aresixareas for which area forecasts are published in the contiguous 48 states.Area forecasts are issued three times a day and are valid for 18 hours. This type of forecast gives information vital to en route operations,as well as forecast information forsmaller airports that do not have terminal forecasts.  

Areaforecasts are typically disseminated in four sections and include the following information:  

1. Header—gives the location identifier of the source of the FA,the date and time ofissuance,the valid forecast time,and the area of coverage.  

Example: DFWCFA120945 SYNOPSIS AND VFR C LDS/WX SYNOPSISVALIDUNTIL130400 CLDS/WXVALIDUNTIL122200...OTLKVALID 122200-130400 OK TX AR LAMS A LAND CST LW TRS  

Explanation:  

The area forecast shows information given by Dallas Fort Worth,for the region of Oklahoma, Texas,Arkansas, Louisiana,Mississippi,andAlabama,as well as a portion of the Gulf coastal waters.It was issued on the 12th day of the month at 0945. The synopsis is valid from the time of issuance until 0400 hours on the 13th.VFR clouds and weather information on this area forecast are valid until 2200 hoursonthe12thandtheoutlookisvalidfrom2200Zonthe 12 th to 0400 Zon the 13 th  

2. Precautionary statements—IFR conditions, mountain obscurations,and thunderstorm hazards are described in this section.Statements made here regarding height are given in MSL, and if given otherwise, AGL or ceiling(CIG)isnoted.  

Example:  

SEE AIR MET SIERRA FOR IFR COND S AND MTN  

OBSCN. TSIMPLYSEVORGTRTURBSEVICELLWSAND IFRCONDS. NON MSL HGT S DENOTED BY A GL OR CIG  

# Explanation:  

The area forecast covers VFR clouds and weather, so the precautionary statement warns that AIR MET Sierra should be referenced for IFR conditions and mountain obscuration. The code TS indicates the possibility of thunderstorms and implies there maybe occurrences of severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, low-level wind shear, and IFR conditions. Thefinalline of the precautionary statement alerts the user that heights, for the most part, are MSL. Those that are not MSL will state A GL or CIG  

3. Synopsis gives a brief summary identifying the location and movement of pressure systems, fronts, and circulation patterns.

Explanation:  

In south central and southeastern Texas, there is a scattered to broken layer of clouds from 1,oo0 feet AGL with tops at 3,000feet,visibility is 3 to 5 SM in mist.Between1400Zand 1600Z, the cloud bases are expected to increase to 3,000feet AGL.After1900Z,the cloud bases are expected to continue toincreaseto5,Oo 0 feet A GLand the outlook is VFR.  

InnorthwesternOklahomaandpanhandle,thecloudsare scattered at3,000feetwith another scattered tobrokenlayer at 10,000feetAGL,with the topsat20,000feet.At1500 Z,the lowest cloud base is expected to increase to 4,000 feet A GL with a scattered layer at10,000feetAGL.After 200oZ,theforecast callsfor scattered thunderstorms with rain developingand a few becoming severe;theCBcloudshave tops at flight level (FL) 450 or 45,000 feet MSL.  

Itshouldbenoted that when information is given in the area forecast, locations may be given by states, regions, or specific geological features such as mountain ranges.Figure13-8 shows an area forecast chart with six regions of forecast, states, regional areas, and common geographical features.  

# InflightWeather Advisories  

Inflight weather advisories, which are provided to en route aircraft,are forecasts that detail potentially hazardous weather. These advisories are also available to pilots prior to departure for flight planning purposes.An inflight weather advisoryis issuedin theform ofeither anAIRMET, SIGMET,or convective SIG MET.  

# AIRMET  

AIRMETs(WAs)are examples of in flight weather advisories that are issued every 6 hours with intermediate updates issued as needed for a particular area forecastregion.The information contained in an AIRMET is of operational interest to all aircraft,but the weather section concerns phenomena considered potentially hazardous to light aircraft and aircraft with limited operational capabilities.  

An AIR MET includes forecast of moderate icing,moderate turbulence,sustained surface winds of 30 knots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,oo0 feet and/or visibilities less than three miles,and extensive mountain obscure ment.  

EachAIRMETbulletinhasafixedalphanumericdesignator numbered sequentially for easy identification,beginningwith the first issuance of the day.Sierra is the AIR MET code used todenoteIFR and mountain obscura tion;Tangoisused to denote turbulence,strong surface winds,andlow-level wind shear;andZuluisused to denote icing and freezing levels

Within an area bounded by: Caribou, ME; toSaintJohns,NewBrunswick;to 150 nautical miles east of Nantucket,MA;toNewark,NJ;to Ottawa,Ontario; toCaribou,ME.TheeffectedstateswithinCaribou,ME to Millinocket,ME to Concord, NH to Slate Run,PA to Syracuse, NY to Caribou, ME will experience ceilings below 1,000 feet/visibility below 3 SM, precipitation/mist. Conditions will continue beyond 0200Z through 0800Z.  

# SIGMET  

SIGMETs（WSs）are in flight advisories concerning non- convective weather that is potentially hazardous to all aircraft.They report weather forecasts that include severe icing not associated with thunderstorms,severeorextreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with thunderstorms,dust storms or sandstorms thatlower surface or in flight vi sibi li ties to below three miles,andvolcanicash. SIG METs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid for 4 hours unlesstheSIGMETrelatestoahurricane,inwhichcaseit is valid for 6 hours.  

A SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier, from November throughYankee.The first issuance of a SIGMET is designated as an Urgent Weather SIGMET (UWS). Reissued SIG METs for the same weather phenomenon are sequentially numbered until the weather phenomenon ends.  

Example: SFORWS100130 SIGMETROME02VALIDUNTIL100530 ORWA FROM SEA TO PDT TO EUG TO SEA OC N LSE VC AT BT NFL 280 AND FL 350 EXP CD DUETOJTSTR CONDSBGNGAFT0200ZCONTGBYD0530Z

# Convective Significant Meteorological Information (WST)  

A Convective SIG MET（WST）is an in flight weather advisory issued for hazardous convective weather that affects the safety of every flight.Convective SIG METs are issued for severe thunderstorms with surface winds greater than 50 knots, hail at the surface greater than or equal to  $\%$  inch in diameter, or tornadoes. They are also issued to advise pilots of embedded thunderstorms,lines of thunderstorms,or thunderstorms with heavy or greater precipitation that affect 40 percent or more of a 3,0o0 square mile or greater region.  

Convective SIG METs are issued for each area of the contiguous 48 states but not Alaska or Hawaii.Convective SIGMETs are issued for the eastern(E),western(W),and central (C) United States.Each reportis issued at 55minutes past the hour, but special Convective SIGMETs can be issued during the interim for any reason.Eachforecast is validfor 2hours.They arenumbered sequentiallyeach day from 1-99, beginning at 00Z time. If no hazardous weather exists,the convective SIG METis still issued;however,it states"CONVECTIVE SIG MET...NONE."

# Explanation:  

Convective SIGMET was issued for the central portion of the United States on the  $22\mathrm{nd}$  at1855Z.Thisisthe20th Convective SIG MET issued on the 22 nd for the central United States as indicated by“20C"and is valid until 2055Z. The affected states are North and South Dakota,from 90 nautical miles west of Minot, ND; to Grand Forks, ND; to Aberdeen, SD; to 9O nautical miles west of Minot, ND.An intensifying area of severe thunderstorms moving from 240 degrees at 45 knots(tothenortheast).Thunderstorm topswill be above FL 450. Wind gusts up to 60 knots were reported.  

Also reported were tornadoes,hail to 2 inches in diameter, and wind gusts to65knots possible in theNorth Dakota portion  

# Windsand TemperatureAloftForecast(FB)  

Winds and temperatures aloft forecasts (FB) provide wind and temperature forecasts for specific locations throughout the United States,including network locations in Hawaii and Alaska.The forecasts are made twice a daybased on the radiosondeupper air observations taken at0000Zand1200Z  

Altitudes through 12,000 feet are classified as true altitudes while altitudes 18,oo 0 feet and above are classified as altitudes and are termed flight levels.Wind direction is always in reference to true north,and wind speed is given in knots.The temperature is given in degrees Celsius.Nowinds areforecast when a given level is within 1,500feet of the station elevation.Similarly,temperatures are notforecastfor any station within 2,500 feet of the station elevation.  

If the wind speed is forecast to be greater than 99 knots but less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the direction and subtracts 1o0from the speed. To decode this type of data group,the reverse must be accomplished.Forexample,when thedata appears as“731960’"subtract50from the73and add 100 to the 19, and the wind would be  $230^{\circ}$  at 119knots with a temperatureof  $-60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  If the wind speed is forecast to be 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded as 99 knots. For example, when the data appears as “7799,” subtract 50 from 77 and add 100 to 99, and the wind is  $270^{\circ}$  at 199knots orgreater.When the forecast wind speed is calm,orless than 5 knots, the data group is coded "9900," which means light andvariable.[Figure13-9]  

# Explanation of Figure 13-9.  

The heading indicates that this FB was transmitted on the 15th of themonth at1640Z and isbased on the1200Zupper air data.The valid time is 1800 Zon the same day and should be used for the period between 1400Z and 2100Z. The heading also indicates that the temperatures above FL 240 arenegative.Therefore,the minus sign will be omitted fon all forecast temperatures above FL 240  

A four-digit datagroupshows thewind directionin reference to true north and the wind speed in knots.The elevation at Amarillo,Texas(AMA)is3,605feet,so the lowest report able  

![](images/502fe30b5ecce2fa7082ab369bf665a74ab11b01c83c8adbe70a5f89707f5e3d.jpg)  

altitude is 6,0oo feet for the forecast winds. In this case. "2714"means the wind is forecast tobe from  $270^{\circ}$  ataspeed of14knots.  

Asix-digit group includes the forecast temperature aloft The elevation at Denver (DEN) is 5,431 feet, so the lowest reportable altitude is 9,oo0feet for the winds and temperature forecast. In this case, "2321-04"indicates the wind is forecast to befrom  $230^{\circ}$  at aspeed of21knotswith a temperatureof  $-4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  

# Weather Charts  

Weather charts are graphic charts that depict current or forecast weather. They provide an overall picture of the UnitedStates and shouldbeusedin the beginning stages of flight planning. Typically, weather charts show the movement of major weather systems and fronts.Surfaceanalysis weather depiction, and significant weather prognostic charts aresourcesofcurrentweatherinformation.Significant weatherprognosticchartsprovideanoverallforecastweather picture.  

# Surface Analysis Chart  

Thesurface analysis chart depicts an analysis of the current surfaceweather.[Figure13-1o] This chart is transmitted every3hoursandcoversthecontiguous48statesand adjacentareas.A surface analysis chart shows the areas of high and low pressure, fronts, temperatures, dew points, wind directions and speeds, local weather, and visual obstructions. Surface weather observations for reporting points across the United States are also depicted on this chart. Each of these reporting points is illustrated by a station model. [Figure13-ll]A station model includes:  

Sky cover the station model depicts total sky cover and is shown as clear, scattered, broken, overcast, or obscured/partially obscured. Sea level pressure——given in three digits to the nearest tenth of a millibar (mb). For   $1{,}000~\mathrm{{mbs}}$  or greater, prefix a 10 to the three digits. For less than  $1{,}000\,\mathrm{mbs}$  prefix a 9 to the three digits. Pressure change/tendency——pressure change in tenths of mb over the past 3 hours. This is depicted directly below the sea level pressure. Dewpointgivenin degreesFahrenheit Present weather over 1 o 0 different standard weather symbols are used to describe the currentweather. Temperature—given in degrees Fahrenheit. Wind—true direction of wind is given by the wind pointer line,indicating the direction from which the windisblowing.A short barb is equal to 5 knots of wind, a long barb is equal to 10 knots of wind, and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.

# Weather Depiction Chart  

A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as derived from META Rand other surface observations.The weather depiction chart is prepared and transmitted by computer every 3 hours beginning at 0100Z time and is valid data for the forecast period.It is designed to be used for flight planning by giving an overall picture of theweather across theUnitedStates.[Figure13-12]  

The weather depiction chart also provides a graphic display of IFR,VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather.Areas of IFR conditions (ceilings less than 1,ooo feet and visibility less than three miles) are shown by a hatched area outlined by a smooth line. MVFR regions (ceilings 1,000 to 3,000 feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles) are shown by a nonhatched area outlined by a smooth line. Areas of VFR (no ceiling or ceiling greater than 3,000 feet and visibility greater than five miles) are not outlined. Also plotted are fronts, troughs, and squall linesfrom theprevioushourssurface analysischart.  

Weather depiction charts show a modified station model that provides sky conditions in theform of totalskycover, ceiling height, weather, and obstructions to visibility,but does not include winds or pressure readings like the surface analysis chart.Abracket(])symbol to theright ofthe station indicates the observation was made by an automated station.  

# Significant Weather Prognostic Charts  

Significant weather prognostic charts are available for low- level significant weather from the surface to FL 240(24,000 feet),also referred to as the  $400~\mathrm{mb}$  level and high-level significant weather from FL 250 to FL 630 (25,000 to 63,000 feet).Theprimary concern of this discussionis thelow-level significant weather prognostic chart.  

Thelow-level chart is is a forecast of aviation weather hazards,primarilyintendedtobeusedasaguidanceproduct for briefing the VFR pilot. The forecast domain covers the 48 contiguous states,southern Canada and the coastal waters for altitudes below 24,000ft.Low altitude Significant Weather charts are issued four times daily and are valid at fixed times: 0000,0600,1200, and 1800 UTC.Each chart is divided on the left and right into 12 and 24 hour forecast intervals(based onthecurrentNAMmodelavailable).

Effective September 1,2015,thefour-panelLowLevel SFC-240chartwasreplacedwithatwo-panelchart.Thenew two-panel chart willbe thesame as thetop twopanels in the former four-panel chart, depicting the freezing level and areas of IFR, MVFR, and moderate or greater turbulence. The bottom twopanels of the chart havebeen removed. In lieu of these bottom two panels, an enhanced surface chart that includes fronts, pressure, precipitation type, precipitation intensity, and weather type,is displayed.The green precipitation polygons will be replaced by shaded precipitation areas using the National Digital Forecast Database(NDFD) weather grid.  

Figure13-13 depicts the new two-panel significant weather prognosticchart,as well as the symbols typically used to depict precipitation. The two panels depict freezing levels, turbulence,and low cloud ceilings and/or restrictions to visibility(shown as contoured areas of MVFR and IFR conditions). These charts enable the pilot to pictorially evaluate existing and potential weather hazards they may encounter.Pilots canbalance weather phenomenawith their aircraft capability and skill set resulting in aeronautical decision-making appropriate to the flight. Prognostic charts are an excellent source of information for preflight planning; however, this chart should be viewed in light of current conditions and specific local area forecasts.  

The36-and 48-hour significant weather prognostic chart is anextensionof the12-and24-hourforecast.Thischartis issued twice a day. It typically contains forecast positions and characteristics of pressure patterns, fronts, and precipitation Anexampleofa36-and48-hour surface prognostic chart is showninFigure13-14  

# ATCRadarWeather Displays  

Although ATC systems cannot always detect the presence or absence of clouds, they can often determine the intensity of a precipitation area,but thespecific character of that area (snow, rain, hail, VIRGA, etc.) cannot be determined. For this reason, ATC refers to all weatherareas displayed on ATC radar scopes as"precipitation.  

ARTCCfacilities normally use a Weather andRadar Processor(WARP)to displaya mosaicof dataobtained from multiple NEXRADsites.Thereis a time delaybetween actual conditions and those displayedto thecontroller. The precipitation data on the ARTCC controller's display couldbeupto6minutesold.TheWARPprocessorisonly used in ARTCC facilities.All ATC facilities using radar weather processors with the ability to determine precipitation intensity, describe the intensity to pilots as:  

Light Moderate Heavy Extreme  

When the WARP is not available, a second system, the narrowband Air Route Surveillance Radar(ARSR）can display two distinct levels of precipitation intensity that is described to pilots as"MODERATE and“HEAVY TO EXTREME."  

ATC facilities that cannot display the intensity levels of precipitation due to equipment limitations describe the location of the precipitation area by geographic position or position relative to the aircraft.Since the intensity level is not available, the controller states"INTENSITY UNKNOWN."  

ATC radar is not able todetect turbulence.Generally, turbulence can be expected to occur as the rate of rainfall or intensity of precipitation increases.Turbulence associated with greater rates of precipitation is normally more severe than  

![](images/d6b7b52247f80111e9c7383a448d8bb51e83ed65673d755776a68fad60b73232.jpg)

any associated with lesser rates of precipitation.Turbulence should be expected to occur near convective activity,even inclear air.Thunderstorms area form of convective activity that imply severe or greater turbulence. Operation within 20 miles of thunderstorms should be approached with great caution,astheseverityofturbulencecanbemuchgreaterthan the precipitation intensity might indicate.  

# WeatherAvoidanceAssistance  

To the extentpossible,controllers will issue pertinent information on weather and assist pilots in avoiding such areas when requested.Pilots should respond to a weather advisory by either acknowledging theadvisoryor by acknowledging the advisory and requesting an alternative course of action as follows:  

Request to deviate off course by stating the num bei of miles and the direction of the requested deviation Request a new route to avoid the affected area. Request a change of altitude Request radar vectors around the affected areas  

The controller's primary function is to provide safe separation betweenaircraft.Any additional service,suchasweather avoidance assistance, can only be provided to the extent that it does not detract from the primary function. It's also worth noting that the separation workloadis generally greater than normal when weather disrupts the usual flow of traffic. ATC radar limitations and frequency congestion may also be a factor in limiting the controller's capability to provide additional service.  

# Electronic Flight Displays (EFD) /Multi- FunctionDisplay(MFD)Weather  

Many aircraft manufacturers now include data link weather services with new electronic flight display(EFD)systems. EF Ds give a pilot access to many of the data link weather services available.  

Products available to a pilot on the display pictured in Figure13-15 arelisted asfollows.The letters in parentheses indicate the soft key to press in order toaccess the data.  

Graphical NEXRAD data (NEXRAD) Graphical METAR data (METAR) Textual MET ARdat a Textual terminal aerodrome forecasts (TAF) Cityforecast data Graphical wind data (WIND) Graphical echo tops (ECHO T.,OPS)  

Graphical cloud tops (CLD TOPS) Graphical lightning strikes (LTNG) Graphical storm cell movement (CELL MOV) NEXRAD radar coverage (information displayed with theNEXRADdata) SIGMETs/AIRMETs (SIG/AIR) Surface analysis to include city forecasts (SFC) County warnings (COUNTY) Freezing levels (FRZ LVL) Hurricane track (CYCLONE) Temporary flight restrictions (TFR)  

Pilots must be familiar with anyEFDorMFDused and the data link weather products available on the display.  

# Weather Products Age and Expiration  

The information displayed using a data link weather link is near realtime but should not be thought of as instantaneous, up-to-dateinformation.Eachtypeofweatherdisplayis stamped with the age information on the MFD.The time is referenced from Zulu when the information was assembled at the ground station.The age should not be assumed to be the time when the F IS received the information from the data link.  

Two types of weather are displayed on the screen:“current" weather and forecast data.Current information is displayed by an age while the forecast data has a data stamp in the form of“—/ —:_."[Figure13-16]  

# The Next Generation Weather Radar System (NEXRAD)  

TheNEXRADsystemiscomprisedofaseriesof159Weather Surveillance Radar-1988Doppler(WSR-88D) sites situated throughout the United States, as well as selected overseas sites. The NEXRAD system is a joint venture between the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), the United States DOD, as well as the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). The individual agencies that have control over the system are the NwS,Air Force Weather Agency(AFWA)and theFAA.[FigureI3-17]  

NEXRAD data for up to a 2,0o0 mile range can be displayed. It is important to realize that the radar image is not realtime and can be up to 5 minutes old.TheN TSB has reported on 2 fatal accidents where in-cockpit NEXRAD mosaic imagery was available to pilots operating near quickly-developingand fast-moving convective weather. In one of these accidents, the images were from 6 to8 minutes old.In some cases, NEXRAD data can age significantly by the time the mosaic imageiscreated.In some extreme latency cases,theactual

Figure 13-15. Information page.  

ageof the oldest NEXRADdata in themosaic can exceed the age indication in the cockpit by 15 to 20 minutes.Even small-time differences between the age indicator and actual conditionscanbeimportantforsafetyofflight,especially when considering fast-moving weather hazards, quickly developing weather scenarios, and/or fast-moving aircraft. At no time should the images be used as storm penetrating radar nor to navigate through a line of storms.The images display should onlybeused as areference.  

NEXRAD radar is mutually exclusive of Topographic (TOPO),TERRAIN and STORM SCOPE.WhenNEXRAD is turned on,TOPO,TERRAIN,and STORMSCOPE are turned off because the colors used to display intensities are verysimilar.  

Lightning information is available to assist when NEXRAD is enabled. This presents a more comprehensive picture of the weather in the surrounding area.  

In addition to utilizing the soft keys to activate theN EX RAD display,thepilot alsohasthe option of setting the desired range.It ispossible tozoom in on a specific area of the display in order to gain a more detailed picture of the radar display.[Figure13-18]  

# What CanPilots Do?  

Remember that the in-cockpit NEXRAD display depicts where the weather WAS, not where it IS. The age indicaton does not show the age of the actual weather conditions, but rather the age of the mosaic image. The actual weather conditions couldbe up to 15 to 20 minutes OLDER than the age indicated on the display. You should consider this

potential delay when using in-cockpit NEXRAD capabilities. as the movement and/or intensification of weather could adversely affectsafetyof flight.  

Understand that the common perception of a"5-minute latency"with radar data is not always correct. Get your preflight weather briefing! Having in-cockpit weather capabilities does not circumvent theneed fon a complete weather briefing before takeoff. Use all appropriate sources of weather information to make in-flight decisions. Let your fellow pilots know about the limitations of in-cockpitNEXRAD  

# NE X RAD Abnormalities  

Although NE X RAD is a compilation of stations across thecountry,there can be abnormalities associated with the system.Some of the abnormalities arelisted below.  

Groundclutter Strobes and spurious radar data Sun strobes, when the radar antenna points directly at thesun Interference from buildings or mountains that may causeshadows Military aircraft that deploy metallic dust and may reflect theradar signature  

# NEXRADLimitations  

In addition to the abnormalities listed,theNEXRADsystem does have some specific limitations.  

Base Reflectivity  

TheN EX RAD base reflectivity does not provide adequate information from which to determine cloud layers or type of precipitation with respect tohail versus rain. Therefore, a pilot may mistake rain for hail.  

In addition,the base reflectivity is sampled attheminimum antenna elevation angle. With this minimum angle, an individual site cannot depict high altitude storms directly over the station. This leaves an area of null coverage if an adjacent site does not also cover the affected area.  

# Resolution Display  

The resolution of thedisplayed data poses additional concerns when therange is decreased.Theminimum resolution for NEXRADreturns is 1.24 miles.This means that when the display range is zoomed in to approximately ten miles, the individual square return boxes are more prevalent.Each square indicates the strongest display return within that 1.24 milesquarearea.  

# AIRMET/SIGMETDisplay  

AIRMET/SIG MET information is available for the displayed viewing range on the MFD. Some displays are capable of displaying weather information for a 2,0o0 mile range. AIRMETS/SIGMETS are displayed by dashed lines on the map.[Figure13-19]  

The legend box denotes the various colors used to depict the AIRMETs,suchasicing,turbulence,IFRweather,mountain obscuration,and surface winds.[Figure13-20] The great advantage of the graphically displayed AIR MET/SIGMET boundary box is the pilot can see the extent of the area that the advisory covers. The pilot does not need to manually plot the points to determine thefull extentof thecoverage area  

# Graphical METARs  

METARs can be displayed on the MFD.Each reporting station thathas a METAR/TAF available is depicted by aflag from the center of the airport symbol.Each flag is color coded to depict the type of weather that is currently reported at that station.A legend is available to assist users in determining whateachflag color represents.[Figure13-21]  

The graphical METAR display shows all available reporting stations within the set viewing range. By setting the range knob up to a 2,0o0 mile range, pilots can pan around the display map to check the current conditions of various airports along the route of flight.  

By understanding what each colored flag indicates, a pilot can quickly determine where weather patterns display marginal weather,IFR,or areas of VFR.These flags make it easy to determine weather at a specific airport should the need arise to divert from the intended airport of landing.  

# Data LinkWeather  

Pilots now have the capability of receiving continuously updated weather across the entire country at any altitude. No longer are pilots restricted by radio range or geographic isolations,such as mountains or valleys.  

In addition,pilots no longer have to request specific information from weather briefing personnel directly. When the weather becomes questionable, radio congestion often increases, delaying the timely exchange of valuable inflight weather updates for a pilot's specific route of flight. Flight ServiceStation(FSS)personnelcancommunicatewith only one pilot at a time, which leaves other pilots waiting and flying in uncertain weather conditions. Data link weather

provides the pilot with a powerful resource for enhanced situational awareness at any time.Dueto continuous datalink broadcasts, pilots can obtain a weather briefing bylooking at a displayscreen.Pilotshave a choice between FAA-certified devicesorportablereceiversasasourceofweatherdata.  

# Data Link Weather Products  

# Flight Information Service-Broadcast(FIS-B)  

Flight Information Service-Broadcast(FIS-B)isaground broadcast service provided through the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast(ADS-B)Services network over the  $978\,\mathrm{MHz}$  UAT data link.The FAA FIS-B system provides pilots and flight crews of properly-equipped aircraft with a flight deck display of certain aviation weather and aeronautical information which are listed below.  

Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) Special Aviation Reports(SPECIs) Terminal Area Forecasts(TAFs)and their amendments NEXRAD (regional and CONUS)precipitation maps Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Distant and Flight Data Center Airmen's Meteorological Conditions (AIRMET)  

Significant Meteorological Conditions (SIGMET) and Convective SIG MET Status of Special Use Airspace (SUA) Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) Winds and Temperatures Aloft. PilotReports (PIREPS) TIS-Bservicestatus  

The weather products provided by FIS-B are forinformation only.Therefore,these products do not meet the safety and regulatory requirements of official weather products.The weather products displayed on FIS-B should not be used as primary weather products (i.e., aviation weather to meet operational and safety requirements). Each aircraft system is different and some of the data that is rendered can be up to 20 or 30 minutes old and not current.Pilots should consult the individual equipment manuals for specific delay times.  

# Pilot Responsibility  

It is important for pilots to understand the realization that the derived safety benefits of data link depends heavily upon the pilot's understanding of the specific system's capabilities and limitations which arelistedbelow.  

Product latency—be aware of the time stamp or“valid until’ time on the particular data link information displayed in the flightdeck. For example, since initial processing and transmission of NEXRAD data can take several minutes, pilots must assume that data link weather information will always be a minimum of seven to eight minutes older than shown on the time stamp and only use data link weather radar images for broad strategic avoidance of adverseweather. Product update cycles——be aware of when and how often a product is updated as well as the Data Link Service Providers (DLSP) update rate for particular products. Indication of system failure—-be aware of partial or total system failure indications. Coverage areas/service volume coverage limitations are associated with the type of data link network being used. For example, ground-based systems that require a line-of-sight may have relatively limited coveragebelow5,000feetAGL.Satellite-baseddata link weather systems can have limitations stemming from whether the network is in geosynchronous orbit or low earth orbit. Also, NWS NEXRAD coverage has gaps, especially in the western states. Content/format—since service providers often refine or enhance data link products for flightdeck display, pilots must be familiar with the content, format, and meaning of symbols and displays (i.e., the legend) in the specific system. Data integrity/limitations to use—reliability of information depicted.Be aware of any applicable disclaimer provided by the serviceprovider. Use of equipment/avionics display——-pilots remain responsiblefor theproperuseof an electronic flight bag(EFB)or installed avionics.Pilotsshouldbe cognizant that, per the FAA Practical Test Standards. they may be evaluated on the use and interpretation of an EFB or installed avionics on the aircraft. Overload of Information—most DLSPs offer numerous products with information that can be layered on top of each other. Pilots need to be aware that too much information can have a negative effect on their cognitive work load. Pilots need to manage the amount of information to a level that offers the most pertinent information to that specific flight without  

creating a distraction. Pilots may need to adjust the amountofinformationbasedonnumerousfactors including,butnot limited to,thephase of flight,single pilotoperation, autopilot availability,class of airspace, and the weather conditions encountered.  

# Chapter Summary  

While no weather forecast is guaranteed to be 1o0 percent accurate,pilots have access to a myriad of weather information on which to base flight decisions.Weather products available for preflight planning to en route information received over the radio or via data link provide the pilot with the most accurate and up-to-date information available. Each report provides a piece of the weather puzzle.Pilots must use several reports to get an overall picture and gain an understanding of theweather that affects the safe completion of a flight  

# Airport perations  

# Introduction  

Each time a pilot operates an aircraft, the flight normally begins and ends at an airport. An airport may be a small sod field or a large complex utilized by air carriers. This chapter examines airport operations,identifies features of an airport complex, and provides information on operating on orin the vicinity of an airport.  

# Airport Categories  

The definition for airports refers to any area of land or water used or intended for landing or takeoff of aircraft. This includes, within the five categories of airports listed below, special types of facilities including seaplane bases, heliports, and facilities to accommodate tilt rotor aircraft. An airport includes an area used or intended for airport buildings, facilities, as well as rights of way together with the buildings and facilities.  

![](images/726640305f516ca22393ea0dcefef4c0408a12eb1321c7d023a104b1257521fb.jpg)  

The law defines airports by categories of airport activities, including commercial service,primary,cargoservice. reliever, and general aviation airports, as shown below:  

Commercial Service Airports—publicly owned airports that have at least 2,500 passenger boardings each calendar year and receive scheduled passenger service.Passenger boarding s refer to revenue passenger boardings on an aircraft in service in air commerce whetherornotinscheduledservice.Thedefinition also includes passengers who continue on an aircraft in international flight that stops at an airport in any of the 50 States for a non-traffic purpose, such as refueling or aircraft maintenance rather than passenger activity. Passenger boardings at airports that receive scheduled passenger service are also referred to as Enplanements. Cargo Service Airports—-airports that, in addition to any other air transportation services that may be available, are served by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargowith a total annual landed weight of more than1o0 million pounds.Landed weightmeans the weight of aircraft transporting only cargo in intra state, interstate, and foreign air transportation. An airport maybe both a commercial service and a cargo service airport. Reliever Airports—airports designated by the FAA to relieve congestion at Commercial Service Airports and to provide improved general aviation access to the overall community. These may be publicly or privately- owned. General Aviation Airports — the remaining airports are commonly described as General Aviation Airports. This airport type is the largest single group of airports in the U.S. system. The category also includes privately owned, public use airports that enplane 2500 or more passengers annually and receive scheduled airline service.  

# Types of Airports  

There are two types of airportstowered and nontowered. These types can be further subdivided to:  

Civil Airports airports that are open to the general public. Military/Federal Government airports airports operated by the military, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), or other agencies of the Federal Government. Private Airports airports designated for private or restricted use only, not open to the general public  

# Towered Airport  

A towered airport has an operating control tower.Air traffic control (ATC) is responsible for providing the safe, orderly. and expeditious flow of air traffic at airports where the type of operations and/or volume of traffic requires such a service. Pilots operating from a towered airport are required tomaintaintwo-way radio communication with ATC and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions.Pilots must advise ATC if they cannot comply with the instructions issued andrequest amended instructions.A pilot may deviate from an air traffic instruction in an emergency, but must advise ATCof thedeviation assoon aspossible  

# Nontowered Airport  

An on towered airport does not have an operating control tower. Two-way radio communications are not required, although it is a good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the specified frequency for the benefit of other traffic in the area.The key to communicating at an airportwithout an operating control tower is selection of the correct common frequency.The acronym CTAF, which stands for Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, is synonymous with this program.A CTAF is a frequency designated for the purpose of carrying out airport advisory practices while operating to or from an airport without an operating control tower.The CTAF maybe a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency and is identified in appropriate aeronautical publications. UNICOM is a nongovernment air/ground radio communication station that may provide airport information at public use airports where there is no tower or FSS. On pilot request,UNICOM stations may provide pilots with weather information, wind direction, the recommended runway, or other necessary information. If the UNICOM frequency is designated as the CTAF, it is identified in appropriate aeronautical publications.Figure14-1 lists recommended communication procedures. More information regarding radio communications is provided later in this chapter.  

Nontowered airport traffic patterns are always entered at pattern altitude.Howyouenter the pattern depends upon the direction of arrival.Thepreferred methodfor enteringfrom the downwind side of the pattern is to approach the pattern onacourse45degreestothedownwindlegandjointhe pattern atmidfield.  

There are several ways to enter the pattern if you're coming from the up wind leg side of the airport.Onemethod of entry from the opposite side of thepattern is toannounceyour intentionsandcrossovermidfieldatleast5o0feet above  

![Figure14-1.Recommended communication procedures. ](images/48d4923d40d6978d8192b2b0a6f4f73b5c2b55cceb880027203cd24692074a83.jpg)  

pattern altitude(normally1,500feet AGL.) However, iflarge or turbine aircraft operate at your airport,it is best to remain 2,000 feet AGL so you are not in conflict with their traffic pattern. When well clear of the pattern—approximately 2 miles-scan carefully for traffic,descend to pattern altitude,thenturnright toenterat  $45^{\circ}$  to the downwind leg at midfield.[Figure14-2]  

An alternate method is to enter on a midfield cross wind at pattern altitude, carefully scan for traffic, announce your intentions, and then turn downwind.[Figure 14-3] This technique should not be used if the pattern is busy. Always remember to give way to aircraft on the preferred  $45^{\circ}$  entry and to aircraft already established on downwind.  

Ineithercase,it is vital to announce your intentions,and remember to s can outside.Before joining the downwind leg,adjust your course or speed to blend into the traffic. Adjust power on the downwind leg,orsooner,tofitinto the flow of traffic.Avoid flying to of astor too slow.Speeds recommended by the airplane manufacturer should be used. They will generally fall between 70 to 80 knots for fixed-gear singles and 80 to 90 knots for high-performance retractable.  

# Sources for Airport Data  

When a pilot flies into a different airport, it is important to review the current data for that airport.This data provides the pilot with information,such as communication frequencies services available, closed runways, or airport construction. Threecommonsourcesofinformationare:

When the ATIS is recorded,it is given a code.This code is changed with everyATIS update.Forexample,ATIS Alpha is replaced by ATIS Bravo. The next hour, ATIS Charlie is recorded,followed by AT IS Delta and progresses down the alphabet.  

Prior to calling ATC, tune to the ATIS frequency and listen to the recorded broadcast. Thebroadcast ends with a statement containing the AT IS code.Forexample,“Adviseoninitial contact, you have information Bravo." Upon contacting the towercontroller,state information Bravo was received.This allows the tower controller toverify thepilothas the current local weather and airport information without having to state it all to each pilot who calls. This also clears the tower frequency from being overtaken by the constant relay of the same information,which would result without an AT IS broadcast.The use of AT IS broadcasts atdeparture and arrival airports is not only a sound practice but awisedecision.  

# Airport Markings and Signs  

There are markings and signs used at airports that provide directions and assist pilots in airport operations. It is important for you to know the meanings of the signs, markings, and lights that are used on airports as surface navigational aids.Allairport markings are painted on the surface,whereas some signs are vertical and some are painted on thesurface.An overview of the most common signs and markings are described on the following pages. Additional information may be found in Chapter 2, “Aeronautical Lighting and Other Airport Visual Aids,” of the Aeronautical Information Manual(AIM)  

# Runway Markings and Signs  

Runway markings vary depending on the type of operations conducted at the airport.AbasicVFR runwaymayonly have centerline markings and runway numbers. Refer to Appendix C of this publication for an example of the most common runway markings that are found at airports.  

Since aircraft are affected by the wind during takeoffs and landings,runways arelaid out according to thelocal prevailing winds.Runwaynumbers are in reference to magnetic north. Certainairportshavetwooreventhreerunwayslaidoutinthe same direction. These are referred to as parallel runways and are distinguished by a letter added to the runway number (e.g., runway 36L (left),36C (center),and 36R (right)).  

# RelocatedRunwayThreshold  

It is sometimes necessary,due to construction or runway maintenance,toclose onlyaportionof a runway.When a portion of a runway is closed,the runway threshold is relocated asnecessary.It is referred to as are located threshold and methods for identifying there located threshold vary.A common way for there located threshold to be marked is aten foot wide white bar across the width of the runway. [Figure14-5AandB]  

When the threshold is relocated, the closed portion of the runway is not available for use by aircraft for take of for landing, but it is available for taxi. When a threshold is relocated,it closes not only a set portion of the approach end of a runway, but also shortens the length of the opposite direction runway.Yellow arrowheads are placed across the width of the runway just prior to the threshold bar.  

# Displaced Threshold  

A displaced threshold is a threshold located at a point on the runway other than the designated beginning of the runway.Displacement of a threshold reduces the length of runway available for landings. The portion of runway behind a displaced threshold is available for takeoffs in either direction, or landings from the opposite direction. A ten feet widewhitethresholdbarislocatedacrossthewidthofthe runway at the displaced threshold,and white arrows are located along the centerline in the area between the beginning of the runway and displaced threshold.White arrowheads are located across the width of the runway just prior to the thresholdbar.[Figure14-6A and  $B J$

Figure 14-5. (A) Relocated runway threshold drawing. (B) Relocated threshold for Runway 36 at Joplin Regional Airport (JLN).  

# Runway Safety Area  

The runway safety area(RSA)is a defined surface surrounding the runway prepared, or suitable, for reducing the risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot, overshoot,or excursion from the runway.Thedimensions of the RSA vary and can be determined by using the criteria contained within AC 150/5300-13,Airport Design, Chapter 3. Figure 3-1 in AC 150/5300-13 depicts the RSA. Additionally,it provides greater accessibility for firefighting and rescue equipment in emergency situations.  

The RSA is typically graded and mowed.The lateral boundaries are usually identified by the presence of the runway holding position signs and markings on the adjoining taxiwaystubs.Aircraft should not enter the RSA without making sure of adequate separation from other aircraft during operations at uncontrolled airports.[Figure14-7]  

# RunwaySafety Area Boundary Sign  

Some taxiwaystubs alsohave arunwaysafety areaboundary sign that faces the runway and is visible toyou only when exiting the runway. This signhas a yellow background with black markings and is typically used at towered airports where a controller commonly requests you to report clear of a runway. This sign is intended to provide you with another visual cue that is used as a guide to determine when you are clear of the runway safety boundary area. The sign shown in Figure14-8 is what you would see when exiting the runway at TaxiwayKilo.You are out of the runway safety areaboundary when the entire aircraft passes the sign and the accompanying surfacepainted marking.  

# Runway Holding Position Sign  

Noncompliance with a runway holding position sign may result in the FAA filing a Pilot Deviation against you.A

Figure 14-6.(A)Displaced runway threshold drawing.(B) Displaced thresholdfor Runway17at Albuquerque International Airport (ABQ)  

runway holding position sign is an airport version of a stopsign.[FigureI4-9/It maybe seen as a sign and/or its characters painted on the airport pavement. The sign has white characters outlined in black on a red background. It is always collocated with the surface painted holdingposition markings and is located where taxiways intersect runways. On taxiways that intersect the threshold of the takeoff runway, only the designation of the runwaymay appear on thesign.  

If a taxiway intersects a runway somewhere other than at thethreshold,the sign has the designation of the intersecting runway.The runway numbers on the sign are arranged to correspond to the relative location of the respective runway thresholds.Figure14-10shows  $^{\circ}18–36^{\circ}$  toindicatethe threshold for Runway 18 is to the left and the threshold for

Figure14-1o.Runway holding position sign at a location other than the takeoff end of Runway 18-36 with collocated Taxiway Alpha location sign.  

Runway 36 is to the right. The sign also indicates that you arelocated onTaxiwayAlpha  

If the runway holding position sign is located on a taxiway at the intersection of two runways,the designations for both runways are shown on the sign along with arrows showing the approximate alignment of each runway. [Figure14-1lAand  $B J$  In addition to showing the approximaterunwayalignment,thearrowsindicatethe direction(s) to the threshold of the runway whose designation is immediately next to each corresponding arrow.  

This type of taxiway and runway/runway intersection geometry can be very confusing and create navigational challenges.Extreme caution must be exercised when taxiing on to or crossing this type of intersection.Figure14-11Aand  $B$  shows a depiction of a taxiway, runway/runway intersection and is also designated as a "hot spot" on the airport diagram. In theexample, Taxiway Bravo intersects with two runways. 31-13and35-17,which cross each other.  

Surface painted runway holding position signs may also be used to aid you in determining the holding position. These markings consist of white characters on a red background and are painted on the left side of the taxiway center line. Figure14-12 shows a surface painted runway holding position sign that is the holding point for Runway 32R-14L.  

Youshouldnever allowanypartofyouraircrafttocrossthe runwayholding position sign (either a vertical or surface paintedsign)without a clearance from ATC.Doingsoposes a hazard to yourself and others.  

When the tower is closed or you are operating at an on towered airport, you may taxi past a runway holding position sign only whenthe runway is clear of aircraft, and there are no aircraft on final approach.You may then proceed with extreme caution.  

# Runway Holding Position Marking  

Noncompliance with a runway holding position marking may result in theFAA filing a Pilot Deviation againstyou. Runway holding position markings consist of four yellow lines,two solid and two dashed,that are painted on the surface and extend across the width of the taxiway to indicate where the aircraft should stop when approaching a runway. These markings are painted across the entire taxiway pavement,are in alignment, and are collocated with the holding position sign as described above.  

As you approach the runway, two solid yellowlines and two dashed lines will be visible. Prior to reaching the solid lines, it is imperative tostop and ensure that noportion of the aircraft intersects the first solid yellow line.Do not cross the double solid lines until a clearance from AT Chas been received. [Figure14-13/When the tower is closed orwhenoperating at a nontowered airport, you may taxi onto or across the runway only when the runwayis clear and there areno aircraft onfinal approach.You should use extreme caution when crossing or taxiing on to the runway and always look both ways.  

Whenexitingtherunway,thesamemarkingswillbeseen except the aircraft will be approaching the double dashed lines.[Figure14-14]In order tobe clear of therunway, the entire aircraft must cross both the dashed and solid lines. An ATC clearance is not needed to cross this marking when exiting the runway.  

# Runway Distance Remaining Signs  

Runway distance remaining signs have a black background with awhitenumber and maybe installed alongoneorboth sides of the runway.[Figure14-15]Thenumberonthe signs indicates the distance, in thousands of feet, of landing runway remaining. The last sign, which has the numeral “1,' islocated atleast 950 feet from therunwayend.  

# Runway Designation Marking  

Runway numbers and lettersare determinedfrom the approach direction. The runway numberis the whole number nearestone-tenth the magnetic azimuth of the center line of the runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. In the case where there areparallel runways,theletters differentiate betweenleft (L),right (R),or center(C).[Figure 14-16]For example,if there aretwoparallel runways,theywould show thedesignationnumber andtheneither Lor Rbeneathit. For three parallel runways, the designation number would be presented with L, C, or R beneath it.

# LandandHoldShortOperations(LAHSO)  

When simultaneous operations(takeoffs and landings)are being conducted on intersecting runways, Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)may alsobeineffect. LAHSO is an ATC procedure that may requireyour participation and

Figure14-15.Runway distance remaining sign indicating that there is2,ooo feet of runway remaining.  

compliance.As pilot in command(PIC),youhave thefinal authority to acceptor decline any LAH sO clearance.  

If issued a land and hold short clearance,youmustbeaware of the reduced runway distances andwhether or notyou can complybefore accepting the clearance.You do not have toaccepta LAHSOclearance.Pilots should only receive a LAHSO clearance when there is a minimum ceiling of 1,000 feet and 3 statute miles of visibility  

Runway holding position signs and markings are installed on those runways used for LAHSO. The signs and markings are placed at the LAHSO point to aid you in determining where to stop and hold the aircraft and are located prior to therunway/runway intersection.[Figure14-17]  

The holding position sign has a white inscription with black border around the numbers on a red background andis installed adjacent to the holding position markings. If you accept aland and hold short clearance, you must comply so that no portion of the aircraft extends beyond these hold markings.  

If receiving “cleared to land" instructions from ATC, you are authorized to use the entire landing length of the runway and should disregard any LAHSO holding position markings located on the runway. If you receive and accept LAHSO instructions,you must stop short of the intersecting runway prior totheLAHSOsigns and markings.  

Below is a list of items which, if thoroughly understood andcompliedwith,will ensure that LAH SO operations are conducted properly.  

Know landing distance available Be advised by ATC as to why LAHSOare being conducted.

Figure14-16.Two of three parallel runways.  

Advise ATC if you cannot comply with LAH SO Know what signs and markings are at the LAHSO point LAHSO are not authorized for student pilots who are performing a soloflight. At many airports air carrier aircraft are not authorized to participate in LAHSO if the other aircraft is a generalaviation aircraft. Generally, LAHsO are not authorized at night LAHsOarenot authorized onwetrunways.

If you accept the following clearance from ATC: “Cleared to land Runway 36hold short of Runway 23,you must either exit Runway 36 or stop at the holding position prior to Runway 23.  

# Taxiway Markings and Signs  

Taxiway direction signshave a yellow background and black characters,which identifies the designation or intersecting taxiways. Arrows indicate the direction of turn that would place the aircraft on the designated taxiway. [Figure 14-18] Direction signs are normally located on the left side of the taxiway and prior to the intersection. These signs and markings (with a yellow background and blackcharacters)indicate the direction toward a different taxiway,leading off a runway,or out of an intersection. Figure14-18showsTaxiwayDeltaandhowTaxiwayBravo intersectsaheadat  $90^{\circ}$  bothleft and right  

Taxiway direction signs can also be displayed assurface paintedmarkings.Figure14-19 shows Taxiway Bravo as proceeding straight ahead while Taxiway Alpha turnsto the right atapproximately  $45^{\circ}$  

![](images/2b032cca5e7f943b8f96d2e7d7518535f1de5a4111be07a9d679524f075317f1.jpg)

This type of array can be displayed with or without the taxiway location sign,whichinthiscase would be Taxiway Bravo.  

# Enhanced Taxiway Center line Markings  

At most towered airports, the enhanced taxiway centerline markingisused towarnyou of anupcoming runway.It consists of yellow dashed lines on either side of the normal solid taxiway center line and the dashes extend up to 150 feet prior toa runway holdingposition marking.[Figure14-21A and  $B J$  They areused to aidyou inmaintaining awareness during surface movement to reduce runway incursions.  

# Destination Signs  

Destination signs have black characters on a yellow background indicating a destination at the airport. These

Figure14-19.Surface painted taxiway direction signs  

signs alwayshave an arrow showing the direction of the taxi routetothat destination.[Figure14-22]When the arrow on the destination sign indicate saturn,the sign is located prior to the intersection.Destinations commonly shown on these types of signs include runways, aprons, terminals, military areas, civil aviation areas, cargo areas, international areas, and fixed-base operators. When the inscription for two or more destinations having a common taxi route a replaced on a sign, the destinations are separated by a “dot" () and one arrow would be used as shown in Figure 14-22.When the inscription on a sign contains two or more destinations having different taxi routes, each destinationis accompanied by a narrow and separated from the other destination(s)on the sign with a vertical black message divider as shown in Figure14-23.TheexampleshowninFigure14-23shows two signs. The sign in the foreground explains that Runway 20 threshold is to the left, and Runways 32, 2, and 14 are to theright. The sign in thebackground indicates thatyou are located on Taxiway Bravo and TaxiwayNovember will take you to those runways.  

# Holding Position Signs and Markings for an Instrument Landing System(ILS)CriticalArea  

The instrument landing system (ILS) broadcasts signals to arrivinginstrument aircrafttoguidethemtotherunway.Each of theseILSshavecritical areasthatmustbekeptclearofall obstacles in order to ensure quality of thebroadcast signal.At many airports, taxiways extend into the ILS critical area. Most of the time,thisis of noconcern;however,during times of poor weather, an aircraft on approach may depend on a good signal quality. When necessary, ATC will protect the ILS critical area for arrival instrument traffic by instructing taxiing aircraft to"hold short”of Runway (XX) ILS critical area  

TheILScritical area hold sign has white characters,outlined inblack,on a red background and is installed adjacent to the ILS holdingposition markings.[Figure14-24] Theholding position markings for the ILS critical area appear on the pavement as a horizontal yellow ladder extending across the width of the taxiway.  

When instructed to"hold short of Runway(XX)ILScritical area, you must ensure no portion of the aircraft extends beyond these markings. [Figure 14-25] If ATC does not instruct you to hold atthispoint,then you may bypass the IL S critical area hold position markings and continue with your taxi.Figure14-24 shows that the IL S hold sign is located on Taxiway Golf and theILS ladder hold position marking is adjacent to the hold sign.

# Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections  

Holdingposition markings for taxiway/taxiway intersections consist of a single dashed yellowline extending across the width of the taxiway./Figure14-26/They are painted on taxiways whereATC normally holds aircraft short of a taxiway intersection.When instructed by ATC"holdshort of Taxiway X,”you should stop so that no part of your aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When themarking is notpresent,youshould stopyour aircraft at a point that provides adequate clearance from an aircraft on the intersecting taxiway.  

# Marking and Lighting of Permanently Closed Runways and Taxiway s  

For runways and taxiways that are permanently closed, the lighting circuits are disconnected.The runway threshold runway designation,and touchdown markings are obliterated and yellow “Xs" are placed at each end of the runway and at1,ooo-footintervals.  

![](images/58788c44f6010509b4d82b87eb1cc57fc9e4e5c8aae13cd9d3c7087820eebe52.jpg)  
Figure14-26.Holdingposition marking on a taxiway.  

# Temporarily Closed Runways and Taxiways  

For temporarily closed runways and taxiway s,avisual indication is often provided with yellow “Xs" or raised lighted yellow “Xs" placed at each end of the runway. Depending on the reason for the closure,duration of closure, airfield configuration, and the existence and the hours of operation of an ATC tower, a visual indication may not be present.As discussed previouslyin thechapter,youmust always checkNOTAMs andATISfor runway and taxiway closure information.  

Figure14-27Ashows anexampleof ayellow“X"laidflat with an adequate number of heavy sandbags to keep the wind from getting under and displacing the vinyl material.  

A very effective and preferable visual aid to depict temporary closure is the lighted “X" placed on or near the runway designationnumbers.[Figure  $_{I4-27B}$  and  $C J$  Thisdeviceis much more discernible to approaching aircraft thantheother materials described above.  

# Other Markings  

Some other markings found on the airport include vehicle roadway markings,VOR receiver checkpoint markings,and non-movement area boundary markings.  

# Airport Signs  

There are six types of signs that may be found at airports. The more complex the layout of an airport, the more important the signs become to pilots.Appendix C of this publication shows examples of some signs that are found at most airports, their purpose, and appropriate pilot action. The six types of signs are:  

Mandatory instruction signsred background with white inscription. These signs denote an entrance to a runway,critical area,orprohibited area.  

![](images/64230b1d963c7add6882cc876b04bf5d2aeb8333881d8c6a0cd2b54679691011.jpg)  
Figure14-27.(A)Yellow“X"placed on surface of temporarily closed runways.(B)Lighted“X"placed on temporarily closed runways. (C)Lighted“X"at night showing a temporarily closed runway.  

Location signsblack with yellow inscription and a yellow border, no arrows. They are used to identify a taxiway or runway location, to identify the boundary of the runway, or identify an instrument landing system (ILS) critical area.  

Direction signs—yellow background with black inscription. The inscription identifies the designation of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of an intersection. Destination signs—yellow background withblack inscription and arrows. These signs provide information on locating areas, such as runways, terminals, cargo areas,and civil aviation areas. Information signsyellow background with black inscription. These signs are used to provide the pilot with information on areas that cannot be seen from the control tower, applicable radio frequencies, and noise abatement procedures.The airport operator determines the need, size, and location of these signs. Runway distance remaining signs—black background with white numbers.The numbers indicate the distance of the remaining runway in thousands of feet.  

# Airport Lighting  

The majority of airports havesome type oflighting for night operations. The variety and type of lighting systems depends on thevolume and complexity of operations at a given airport. Airport lighting is standardized so that airports use the same light colors for runways and taxiways.  

# Airport Beacon  

Airport beacons help a pilot identify an airport at night The beacons are normally operated from dusk until dawn. Sometimes they are turned on if the ceiling is less than 1,000 feetand/or the ground visibility is less than 3 statute miles VFR minimums). However, there is no requirement for this, so a pilot has the responsibility of determining if theweather meets VFRrequirements.The beacon has a vertical light distribution to make it most effective from  $1{-}10^{\circ}$  abovethehorizon, although it can be seen well above or below this spread.The beaconmaybe an omni directional capacitor-dischargedevice, orit mayrotate at aconstantspeed,thatproduces thevisual effect of flashes at regular intervals. The combination of light colors from an airport beacon indicates the type of airport [Figure14-28]Some of the most common beacons are:  

Flashing white and green for civilianland airports Flashing white and yellow for a water airport Flashing white, yellow, and green for a heliport Two quick white flashes alternating with a green flash identifying a military airport  

# Approach Light Systems  

Approach light systems are primarily intended to provide a means to transition from instrument flight tovisualflight fon landing. The system configuration depends on whether the  

![](images/47bd430ce43931e092164861848264a4b8c83e9475ac324f6f973a992ced6d3d.jpg)  
Figure14-28.Airport rotating beacons.  

runwayis aprecision or non precision instrument runway. Some systems include sequenced flashing lights that appear to thepilot as aballof lighttraveling towardtherunway at high speed. Approach lights can also aid pilots operating underVFRatnight.  

# Visual GlideslopeIndicators  

Visualglideslopeindicatorsprovidethepilotwithglidepath information that can be used for day or night approaches. By maintaining the proper glidepath as provided by the system, a pilot should have adequate obstacle clearance and should touchdown within a specified portion of therunway.  

# Visual ApproachSlopeIndicator(VASI)  

VASI installations are the most common visual glidepath systems in use. The VASI provides obstruction clearance Within  $10^{\circ}$  of the extended runway centerline and up to four nautical miles (NM) from the runway threshold.  

The VASI consists of light units arranged in bars. There are 2-bar and3-barVASIs.The2-barVASIhasnear andfarlight bars and the 3-bar VASI has near, middle, and far light bars. Two-bar VASI installations provide one visual glidepath that is normally set at  $3^{\circ}$  . The 3-bar system provides two glidepaths,the lower glidepath normally set at  $3^{\circ}$  andthe upperglidepath  $\%$  degree above the lower glide path.  

The basic principle of theVASIis that of color differentiation between red and white. Each light unit projects a beam of light, a white segment in the upper part of the beam and a red segment in the lower part of the beam. The lights are arranged so the pilotsees the combination of lights shown in Figure 14-29 toindicate below, on,or above the glidepath  

# OtherGlidepathSystems  

Aprecision approach path indicator(PAPI)uses lights simi lai totheVASIsystem,exceptthey are installed in a single row normallyon theleftsideof therunway.[FigureI4-30]  

![](images/f22e064ca2dd468f584c75365b18f5ea7e02fd27a6b2f8e7ee948b42c1d4f9e3.jpg)  
Figure14-29.Two-barVASIsystem.  

A tri-color system consists of a single-light unit projecting a three-color visual approach path.Below the glide pathis indicated by red, on the glidepath is indicated by green, and above the glide pathis indicated by amber.Whendescending below the glidepath, there is a small area of dark amber. Pilots should not mistake this area for an “above the glidepath" indication.[Figure14-31]  

Pulsating VASIs normally consist of a single-light unit projecting a two-color visual approach path into the final approach area of therunwayupon which theindicator is installed. The “on glidepath" indication is a steady white light. The“slightly below glidepath" indication is a steady red light. If the aircraft descends further below the glidepath, the red light starts to pulsate. The "above glidepath" indication is a pulsating white light. The pulsating rate increases as the aircraft gets further above or below the desired glideslope. The useful range of the system is about four miles during the day and up to ten miles atnight.[Figure14-32]  

# Runway Lighting  

There are various lights that identify parts of the runway complex.These assist a pilot insafely making a takeoff on landing during night operations.  

# Runway EndIdentifier Lights(REIL)  

Runway end identifier lights(REIL) are installed at many airfields to provide rapid and positive identification of the approach end of a particular runway.The system consists of a pair of synchronized flashing lights located laterally on each side of the runway threshold.RE IL s maybe either omni directional or unidirectional facing the approach area.  

# Runway Edge Lights  

Runwayedgelightsareusedtooutlinetheedgesof runways at night or during low visibility conditions. [Figure14-33] Theselights are classified according to the intensitythey are capable of producing:high intensity runway lights (HIRL), medium intensity runway lights (MIRL), and

low intensity runway lights(LIRL).TheHIRL andMIRL have variable intensity settings. These lights are white, except on instrument runways where amber lights are used on the last2,ooo feet or half the length of the runway,whichever is less. The lights marking the end of the runway are red.  

# In-Runway Lighting  

Runway center line lighting system (RCLS)installed on some precision approach runways tofacilitate landing under adverse visibility conditions. They are located along the runway center line and are spaced at 50-footintervals.Whenviewed from the landing threshold, the runway centerline lights are white until thelast 3,000feet of the runway.The whitelights begin to alternate with red for the next 2,0oofeet.For the remaining 1,0o0 feet of the runway, all centerline lights are red.  

Touchdown zone lights(TDZL)—installed onsomeprecision approachrunwaystoindicatethetouchdownzonewhen landing under adverse visibility conditions. They consist of two rows of transverse light bars disposed symmetrically about the runway centerline.The system consists of steady- burning white lights that start 100 feet beyond the landing threshold and extend to 3,0oo feet beyond the landing threshold orto the midpoint of the runway, whichever is less.  

![](images/ef3668432886327916033c2496a2e7e69a894a25d7c3319424185e5495e09ce8.jpg)

Taxiway center line lead-of flights provide visual guidance to persons exiting the runway.Theyarecolor-codedtowarn pilots and vehicle drivers that they are within the runway environment or IL S critical area,whichever is more restrictive. Alternate green and yellow lights are installed, beginning with green, from the runway centerline to one centerline light position beyond the runway holding position or ILS critical area holding position.  

Taxiway centerlinelead-onlights—providevisual guidance to persons entering the runway.These"lead-on'lights are also color-codedwith the same color pattern as lead-off lights towarn pilots andvehicle drivers that they are within the runway environment or ILS critical area, whichever is more conservative. The fixtures used for lead-on lights are bidirectional (i.e., one side emits light for the lead-on function while the other side emits light for thelead-off function). Any fixture that emits yellowlight for the lead-off function also emits yellow light for thelead-onfunction.  

Land and hold short lightsused to indicate the hold short point on certain runways which are approved for LAH sO. Land and hold short lights consist of a row of pulsing white lightsinstalled across therunway at thehold shortpoint Where installed, the lights are on anytime LAHSO is in effect. These lights are off when LAHSO is not in effect.  

# Control of Airport Lighting  

Airport lighting is controlled by ATC at towered airports. At nontowered airports, the lights may be on a timer, or where an FSS is located at an airport, the FSS personnel may control the lighting. A pilot may request various light systems be turned on or off and also request a specified intensity, if available. from ATC or FSS personnel.At selected nontowered airports. the pilot may control the lighting by using the radio. This is done by selecting a specified frequency and clicking the radiomicrophone. [FigureI4-34/Forinformation on pilot controlled lighting at various airports, refer to the Chart SupplementU.S.(formerlyAirport/Facility Directory).  

![Figure14-34.Radio controlled runway lighting ](images/4d098ba1f41f3f8959ed0712416de173216d21a8cc09f01ad4a4db4943cdcb1d.jpg)  

# Taxiway Lights  

Similar to runway lighting,taxiways also have various lights which help pilots identify areas of the taxiway and any surrounding runways.  

# Omnidirectional  

Omni directional taxiway lights outline the edges of the taxiway and are blue in color.At many airports,these edge lights may have variable intensity settings thatmay be adjusted by an ATC when deemed necessary or when requestedbythepilot.Someairportsalsohavetaxiway center line lights that aregreenin color.  

# Clearance Bar Lights  

Clearance bar lights are installed at holding positions on taxiwaysinorder to increase the cons pic u it y of theholding position in low visibility conditions. They may also be installed toindicate thelocation of an intersecting taxiway during periods of darkness. Clearance bars consist of three in-pavementsteady-burning yellow lights.  

# Runway Guard Lights  

Runwayguard lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersections.They are primarily used to enhance the cons pic u it y of taxiway/runway intersections during low visibility conditions,but maybe used in all weather conditions. Runway guard lights consist ofeither a pair of elevated flashing yellow lights installed on either side of the taxiway,orarowof in-pavement yellow lights installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway holding position marking  

Note:Some airports may have a row of three or five in-pavement yellow lights installed at taxiway/runway intersections.They should not be confused with clearance bar lights described previously in this section.  

# StopBarLights  

Stopbar lights,wheninstalled,areused to confirm theATC clearance to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft Runway Visual Range (RVR)). A stop bar consists of arowofred,unidirectional,steady- burning in-pavement lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position,and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side.A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunctionwith thetaxiway centerlinelead-onlights which extend from thestop bar toward therunway.Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-onlights areturnedon.Thestopbar andlead-onlights are automatically reset by a sensor or backup timer.  

# Obstruction Lights  

Obstructions are marked or lighted to warn pilots of their presence during daytime and nighttime conditions. Obstruction lighting can be found both on and off an airport to identify obstructions.They maybe marked or lighted in any of the following conditions.  

Red obstruction lights—flash or emit a steady red color during nighttime operations, and the obstructions are painted orange and white for daytime operations. High intensity white obstruction lights—flash high intensity white lights during the daytime with the intensity reducedfor nighttime. Dual lighting a combination of flashing red beacons and steady red lights for nighttime operation and high intensity whitelightsfor daytime operations.  

# New Lighting Technologies  

A top priority of the FAA is to continue to enhance airport safety while maintaining airport capacity. Reducing runway incursions is a major component of this effort.Runway incursions develop quickly and without warning during routine traffic situations on the airport surface, leaving little time for corrective action.The Runway Status Lights (RWSL)System is designed to provide a direct indication to you that it is unsafe toenter arunway,crossarunway,ortakeofffrom orland on a runway when the system is activated.  

Runway status lights arered in color and indicaterunway statusonly;they do not indicate clearance to enter a runway or clearance to takeoff.The RWS L system provides warning lights on runways and taxiways, illuminating when it is unsafe to enter, cross, or begin takeoff on a runway. Currently, there are two types: Runway Entrance Lights (REL) and Takeoff HoldLights(THL).[Figures14-35and14-36]  

REL provide a warning to aircraft crossing or entering a runway from intersecting taxiway s that there is conflicting traffic on the runway. THL provide a warning signal to aircraft in positionfor takeoff that the runway is occupied and it is unsafe to takeoff.Asof2016,theRWSLsystemis operational at 14 of the nation's busiest airports with 3 more airports scheduled toreceive thesystemby2017.

# Wind Direction Indicators  

It is important for a pilot toknow the direction of the wind. At facilities with an operating control tower, this information is provided by ATC. Information may also be provided by FSS personnel either located at a particular airport or remotely available through a remote communication outlet (RCO),or by requesting information on a CTAF at airports that have the capacity to receive andbroadcast on thisfrequency.  

When none of these services is available,it is possible to determine wind direction and runway in use by visual windindicators.Apilotshouldcheckthesewindindicators even when information is provided on the CTA Fata given airport because there is no assurance that the information provided is accurate.  

The wind direction indicator can be a wind cone,windsock tetrahedron,orwindtee.These are usually located in a central location near the runway and may be placed in the center of a segmented circle,which identifies the traffic pattern direction if it is other than the standard left-handpattern [Figures14-37and14-38]  

The wind sock is a good source of information since it not only indicates wind directionbut allows the pilot to estimate thewindvelocity and/orgustfactor.The windsock extends out straighter in strong winds and tends to move back and forth when the win disgusting.Wind tees and tetrahedrons can swing freely and align themselves with the wind direction. Since a wind tee or tetrahedron can also be manually set to alignwith therunwayinuse,apilotshould alsolook at the windsock for wind information,if one is available.  

# TrafficPatterns  

At airports without an operating control tower, a segmented circlevisual indicator system,if installed,is designedto provide traffic pattern information.[Figure14-38] Usually located in a position affording maximum visibility to pilots in the air and on the ground and providing a centralized location for otherelements ofthesystem,thesegmented circle consists of the following components: wind direction indicators, landing direction indicators,landing stripindicators,and traffic pattern indicators.  

A tetrahedron is installed toindicate the direction oflandings and takeoffs when conditions at the airport warrant its use. It maybe located at the center of a segmented circle and may be lighted for night operations. The small end of the tetrahedron points in the direction of landing. Pilots are cautioned against using a tetrahedron for any purpose other than as an indicator of landing direction. At airports with controltowers,the tetrahedron should only be referenced when the control toweris not in operation.Tower instructions supersede tetrahedron indications.  

Landingstripindicatorsareinstalledinpairsandareusedto show the alignment oflandingstrips.[Figure14-38] Traffic pattern indicators are arranged in pairs in conjunction with landing strip indicators and used to indicate the direction of turns when there is a variation from the normal left traffic pattern. (If there is no segmented circle installed at the airport, traffic pattern indicators may be installed on or near the end oftherunway.)  

At most airports and military air bases, traffic pattern altitudes for propeller-driven aircraft generally extend from 600 feet to as high as 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL). Pilots can obtain the traffic pattern altitude for an airport from the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory). Also,trafficpattern altitudesfor military turbojet aircraft sometimes extend up to 2,500 feet AGL. Therefore, pilots of en route aircraft should be constantly on alert for other aircraft in trafficpatterns and avoid these areaswhenever possible. When operating at an airport, traffic pattern altitudes should be maintained unless otherwise required by the applicable distancefrom cloud criteria according toTitle14of theCode of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,section 91.155.

# Radio Communications  

Operatingin and out of a towered airport, as well as in agood portion of the airspacesystem,requires that an aircraft have two- way radio communication capability. For this reason, a pilot should be knowledgeable of radio station license requirements and radio communications equipment and procedures.  

# Radio License  

There is no license requirement for a pilot operating in the United States; however, a pilot who operates internationally is required to hold a restricted radiotelephone permit issued bytheFederalCommunicationsCommission(FCC).There is also no station license requirement for most general aviation aircraft operating in the United States.Astation license is required,however,for an aircraftthatis operating internationally,that uses other than a VHF radio,andthat meets other criteria.  

# Radio Equipment  

In general aviation, the most common types of radios are VHF. A VHF radio operates on frequencies between 118.0 megahertz(MHz）and  $136.975~\mathrm{MHz}$  and is classified as 720 or 760 depending on the number of channels it can accommodate.The720and760use.  $.025\,\mathrm{MHz}$  (25kilohertz (KHz) spacing (118.025, 118.050) with the 720 having a frequency range up to  $135.975~\mathrm{MHz}$  and the 760 reaching up to136.975MHz.VHFradios arelimited tolineof sight transmissions;therefore,aircraft athigher altitudes are able to transmit and receive at greater distances.  

InMarchof1997,the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)amended its International Standards and Recommended Practices to incorporate a channel plan specifying  $8.33~\mathrm{kHz}$  channel spacings in the Aeronautical Mobile Service.The  $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$  channel planwas adopted to alleviate the shortage of VHF ATC channels experienced in western Europe and in the United Kingdom.Seven western European countries and the United Kingdom implemented the  $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$  channel plan on January 1,1999.Accordingly,aircraft operating in the airspace of these countries must have the capability of transmitting and receivingonthe  $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$  spacedchannels.  

# UsingProper RadioProcedures  

Using proper radio phraseology and procedures contribute to a pilot's ability to operate safely and efficientlyin the airspace system. A review of the Pilot/Controller Glossary contained in theAIM assists a pilot in theuse and understanding of  

![](images/e980b28e1dd4aacd60d7848cd363635e16b2531d6158a2a1bc4a20e7bc37fc5f.jpg)  
Figure14-40.Traffic pattern operation—parallelrunways.  

standard terminology. TheAIM also contains many example: of radio communications.  

ICAOhas adopted a phonetic alphabet that shouldbeused in radio communications. When communicating with ATC, pilots should use this alphabet toidentify their aircraft. [Figure 14-41]  

# Lost Communication Procedures  

It is possible that a pilot might experience a malfunction off the radio. This might cause the transmitter,receiver,or both to become inoperative.If a receiverbecomes inoperative and a pilot needs toland at a towered airport, it is advisable to remain outside or above ClassD airspaceuntil the direction and flow of traffic is determined.A pilot should then advise the tower of the aircraft type, position, altitude, and intention to land. The pilot should continue, enter the pattern, report a position as appropriate, and watch for light signals from the tower. Light signal colors and their meanings are contained in Figure 14-42.  

If the transmitter becomes inoperative,a pilot should follow the previously stated procedures and also monitor the appropriate ATC frequency. During daylight hours,ATC transmissions maybe acknowledged by rocking the wings and at night by blinking the landing light.  

When both receiver and transmitter are inoperative,thepilot should remain outside of Class D airspace until the flow of traffichas been determined and thenenter thepattern and watch for light signals  

Radio malfunctions should be repaired before further flight.If this is not possible,ATC maybe contacted by telephone requesting a VFR departure without two-wayradio communications. No radio(NORDO) procedure arrivals are not accepted at busy airports. If authorization is given todepart,thepilot is advised to monitor the appropriate frequency and/or watchfor lightsignals as appropriate.  

![](images/8750507d8b6b08fa59151685258220b61d26e9ed7574aeb2cdb1ff38d999e3e4.jpg)  

If radio communication is lost, it may be a prudent decision toland at a non-towered airport withlower traffic volume, if practical.When operating at a non-towered airport,noradio communicationis necessary.However,pilots should be extra vigilant when not using the radio. Other traffic may not as easily be aware of your presence when they are expecting the standard radio calls.  

# Air Traffic Control(ATC) Services  

Besides the services provided by an FSS as discussed in Chapter 12,“Aviation Weather Services,” numerous other services are provided by ATC.Inmanyinstances apilot is required to have contact with ATC,but even when not required, a pilot may find their services helpful.  

# Primary Radar  

Radar is a device that provides information on range,azimuth and/or elevation of objects in the path of the transmitted pulses. It measures the time interval between transmission and reception of radio pulses and correlates the angular orientation of the radiated antenna beam or beams in azimuth and/or elevation.Range is determined by measuring the time it takes for the radio wave togo out totheobject andthenreturn tothe receiving antenna. The direction of a detected object from a radar siteis determined by the position of the rotating antenna when the reflected portion of the radio wave is received.  

Modern radar is very reliable and there are seldom outages. This is due to reliable maintenance and improved equipment. Thereare,however,some limitations that may affect ATC services and prevent a controller from issuing advisories concerning aircraft that are not under his or her control and cannot be seen on radar.  

The characteristics of radio waves are such that they normally travel in a continuous straight line unless they are "bent'" by atmospheric phenomena, such as temperature inversions, reflectedor attenuated bydense objectssuch asheavyclouds and precipitation,or screened by high terrain features.Radar signals degrade over distance, cannot penetrate through solid objects such as mountains, and thefastest radar updates every 4.7 seconds. By contrast, the satellite signals used with AutomaticDependentSurveillance-Broadcast(ADS-B)do not degrade over distance,provide better visibility around mountainous terrain and allows equipped aircraft toupdate their own position once a second with better accuracy.  

# ATC Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS)  

The ATC radar beacon system(ATCRBS)is often referred to as"secondary surveillance radar."This system consists of three components and helps in alleviating some of the limitations associated with primary radar.The threecomponents are an interrogator, transponder, and radarscope. The advantages of ATCRBSarethereinforcementofradartargets,rapidtarget identification,and a unique display of selected codes.  

Growing air traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS) willbeaddressed through the use of ADS-B,whichnotonly  

![](images/07964e70367b8428bb5f26157424e164cb9cb62011f5875aa926d63c73a1cdbd.jpg)  

providesall the same information the AT CR BS,butwill do so more rapidly and with significantly more accuracy.By broadcasting aircraft position information to a ground station, ADS-Bcan also provide coverage in areas thatdonothave radarcoverage.Inaddition,ADS-B provides trajectory information that includes speed and direction of motion.  

# Transponder  

The transponder is the airborne portion of the secondary surveillance radar system and a system with which a pilot should be familiar.The AT CR BS cannot display the secondary information unless an aircraft is equipped with a transponder. A transponder is also required to operate in certain controlled airspace as discussed in Chapter 15,“Airspace."  

A transponder code consists of four numbers from O to 7 (4,096 possible codes).There are some standard codes or ATC mayissueafour-digit code to an aircraft.Whenacontroller requests a code or function on the transponder,theword ‘squawk"maybeused.Figure14-43 lists some standard transponder phraseology. Additional information concerning transponder operation can be found in the AIM, Chapter 4.  

![Figure 14-43. Transponder phraseology ](images/f1449d22d2128ee445fd90496f3db3c840207ea45db57ca6679ed8564fd636f3.jpg)  

# AutomaticDependentSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)  

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast(ADS-B)is a surveillance technology being deployed throughout theNAS to facilitate improvements needed to increase the capacity andefficiencyof theNAS,while maintaining safety.ADS-B supports these improvements by providing a higher update rate and enhanced accuracy of surveillance information over the current radar-based surveillance system.In addition,ADS-B enables the expansionof air traffic control(ATC) surveillance servicesinto areaswhere none existed previously.TheADS-B ground system also provides Traffic Information Services- Broadcast(TIS-B)and Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B) for use on appropriately equipped aircraft, enhancing theuser's situational awareness(SA)andimprovingthe overallsafetyoftheNAS.  

The ADS-B system is composed of aircraft avionics and a ground infrastructure.Onboard avionics determine the position of the aircraft by using the GPS and transmit its position along with additional information about the aircraft,toground stations for use by ATC and nearbyADS-B equipped aircraft  

In the United States, ADS-B equipped aircraft exchange information on one of twofrequencies:978 or  $1090\;\mathrm{MHz}$  The 1090 MHz frequency is associated with Mode A, C, and S transponder operations.  ${1090}\,\mathrm{MHz}$  transponders with integrated ADS-B functionality extend the transponder message sets with additionalADS-Binformation.This additional information is known as an“extended squitter”message and referred to as 1090ES.ADS-B equipment operating on  $978\:\mathrm{MHz}$  isknown as the Universal Access Transceiver(UAT))  

# Radar Traffic Advisories  

Radar equipped ATC facilities provide radar assistance to aircraft on instrument flight plans and VFR aircraft provided the aircraftcan communicatewith the facility and are within radar coverage.This basic service includes safety alerts, traffic advisories, limited vectoring when requested, and sequencing at locations where this procedure has been established.ATC issues traffic advisories based on observed radar targets.The traffic is referenced by azimuth from the aircraft in terms of the 12-hourclock.Also,distancein nautical miles, direction in which the target is moving, and type and altitude of the aircraft, if known, are given.  

An example would be:“Traffic10o'clock5mileseast bound, Cessna 152, 3,000 feet." The pilot should note that traffic position is based on the aircraft track and that wind correctioncan affect the clock position at which a pilot locates traffic. This service is not intended to relieve the pilot of the responsibility to see and avoidother aircraft.[Figure14-44] In addition to basic radar service,terminal radar service  

![](images/8ba4060be726383fe154967b195663fbe1bc00b66a2aa03c43a6a140d6198092.jpg)  
Figure 14-44.Traffic advisories  

area(TRSA)has been implemented at certain terminal locations.TRSAs are depicted on sectional aeronautical charts and listed in the Chart Supplement U.S.(formerly Airport/Facility Directory). The purpose of this service is to provide separation between all participating VFR aircraft and all IFR aircraft operating within the TRSA.Class C service provides approved separation between IFR and VFR aircraft and sequencing of VFR aircraft to the primary airport. Class B service provides approved separation of aircraft based on IFR,VFR,and/or weight and sequencing ofVFR arrivals to the primary airport(s).  

# WakeTurbulence  

All aircraft generate wake turbulence during flight. This disturbanceiscausedbyapairofcounter-rotatingvortices trailing from the wingtips. The vortices from larger aircraft pose problems to encountering aircraft. The wake of these aircraft can impose rolling moments exceeding the roll- control authority of the encountering aircraft.Also,the turbulence generated within the vortices can damage aircraft components and equipment if encountered at close range. For thisreason,apilot mustenvision thelocationof thevortex wake and adjust theflight path accordingly  

# Vortex Generation  

Lift is generated by the creation of a pressure differential over the wing surface. The lowest pressure occurs over the upper wing surface and the highest pressure under the wing. This pressure differential triggers the rollup of the airflow aft of the wing resulting in swirling air masses trailing downstream of the wingtips. After the rollup is completed, the wake consists of two counter rotating cylindrical vortices. Most of the energy lies within a fewfeet of thecenter of eachvortex. [Figure14-45]  

![](images/f79547c9437341f79a5f84d98ac7b0ac9a9f8a8c454edfc1ca31a5696ccabaf2.jpg)  
Figure14-45.Vortexgeneration  

# Vortex Strength TerminalArea  

Wake turbulence has historically been thought of as only a function of aircraft weight, but recent research considers additional parameters, such as speed, aspects ofthe wing, wake decay rates, and aircraft resistance to wake, just to name a few. The vortex characteristics of any aircraft will be changed with the extension of flaps or other wing configuration devices, as well as changing speed. However, as the basic factors are weight and speed, the vortex strength increases proportionately with anincrease in aircraft operating weight or decrease in aircraft speed.The greatest vortex strength occurs when thegenerating aircraftisheavy,slow,and clean,since the turbulence from a ‘dirty” aircraft configuration hastens wake decay.  

# EnRoute  

En route wake turbulence events have been influenced by changes to the aircraft fleet mix that have more “Super” (A380)and“Heavy"(B-747,B-777,A340,etc.）aircraft operating in theN AS.There have been wake turbulence events in excess of 30 NM and 2000 feet lower than the wake generating aircraft.Air density is also a factor in wake strength Even though the speeds are higher in cruise at high altitude. the reduced air density may result in wake strength comparable to that in the terminal area. In addition, for a given separation distance,the higher speeds in cruise result in less time for the wake to decay before being encountered by a trailing aircraft.  

# VortexBehavior  

Trailingvorticeshave certainbehavioralcharacteristics that can help a pilot visualize the wake location and take avoidance precautions.  

Vortices are generated from the moment an aircraft leaves the ground (until it touches down), since trailing vortices are the byproductofwinglift.[Figure14-46]Thevortexcirculation is outward, upward, and around the wingtips when viewed from either ahead or behind the aircraft.Testswithlarge

Figure14-46.Vortexbehavior  

aircraft have shown that vortices remains paced a bit less than a wingspan apart,driftingwith thewind,at altitudes greater than a wingspan from the ground. Tests have also shown that the vortices sink at a rate of several hundred feet per minute, slowing their descent and diminishing in strength with time and distance behind the generating aircraft  

Whenthevortices oflarger aircraft sinkclose to theground (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move laterally over the ground at a speed of 2-3 knots.A crosswind decreases the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increases the movement of the downwind vortex. A light quartering tailwind presents the worst case scenario as the wake vortices could be all present along a significant portion of the final approach and extended centerline and not just in the touchdown zone as typically expected.  

# Vortex Avoidance Procedures  

The following procedures are in place to assist pilots in vortex avoidanceinthegivenscenario.  

Landing behind a larger aircraft on the same runway- stayat or above thelarger aircraft's approach flight path and land beyond its touchdown point. [Figure14-47A] Landing behind a larger aircraft on a parallel runway closer than 2,500feetconsider thepossibility of drift and stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path and note its touchdown point. [Figure 14-47B] Landing behind a larger aircraft on crossing runway cross above the larger aircraft's flight path. Landingbehindadepartingaircraftonthesame runway—landprior to the departing aircraft's rotatingpoint. Landing behind a larger aircraft on a crossing runway—note the aircraft's rotation point and, if that point is past the intersection, continue and land prior to the intersection. If the larger aircraft rotates prior to the intersection, avoid flight below its flight path. Abandon the approach unless a landing is ensured well before reaching the intersection.[Figure 14-47C] Departing behind a large aircraft rotate prior to the large aircraft's rotation point and climb above its climb path until turning clear of the wake. For intersection takeoffs on the same runway— be alert to adjacent larger aircraft operations, particularlyupwind of therunwayof intendeduse. If an intersection takeoff clearance is received, avoid headings that cross below the larger aircraft's path. If departing orlanding after alarge aircraft executing a low approach, missed approach, or touch-and-go  

landing(since vortices settle and move laterally near the ground, the vortex hazard may exist along the runway and in the flight path, particularly in a quartering tailwind),it is prudent to wait at least 2 minutes prior to a takeoff or landing Enroute,it is advisable to avoid a path below and behind alarge aircraft,and if alarge aircraft is observed above on the same track, change the aircraft position laterally and preferably up wind  

# Collision Avoidance  

Title 14 of the CFR part 91 has established right-of-way rules, minimum safe altitudes, and VFR cruising altitudes to enhance flight safety.The pilot can contribute to collision avoidance by being alert and scanning for other aircraft.This is particularly important in thevicinityof an airport  

Effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field.Each movement should not exceed  $10^{\circ}$  ,and each should be observed for atleast 1 second to enabledetection.Although back and for they e movements seem preferred by most pilots,each pilot should develop a scanning pattern that is most comfortable and then adhere to it to assure optimum scanning.Even if entitled to the right-of- way,a pilot should yield if another aircraft seems too close.  

# Clearing Procedures  

The following procedures and considerations are in place to assistpilotsin collision avoidance under various situations:  

Beforetakeoff—prior totaxiing ontoarunwayor landing area in preparation for takeoff, pilots should s can the approach area for possible landing traffic, executing appropriate maneuvers to provide a clear viewof theapproach areas. Climbs and descents-during climbs and descents in flight conditions that permit visual detection of other traffic, pilots should execute gentle banks left and right at afrequency thatpermits continuous visual scanning ofthe airspace. Straight and level—during sustained periods of straight-and-level flight,a pilot should execute appropriate clearing procedures at periodic intervals. Traffic patterns—entries into traffic patterns while descending should be avoided. Traffic atVOR sites—due to converging traffic, sustainedvigilanceshouldbemaintainedinthe vicinityofVORsandintersections. Training operations—vigilance should be maintained and clearing turns should be made prior to a practice  

![](images/a847a0aab80b1b6a006aaa5950a3e683da484ce7b0cf935dc1af3f701621370d.jpg)  
Figure14-47.Vortex avoidance procedures  

maneuver. During instruction,the pilot should be asked to verbalize the clearing procedures (call out "clear left, right, above, and below").  

High-wing and low-wing aircraft have their respective blind spots.Thepilotofahigh-wing aircraft should momentarily raisethewingin the directionof theintended turn andlook for traffic prior to commencing the turn. The pilot of a low- wing aircraft should momentarily lower thewing and look for traffic prior to commencing the turn.  

# Pilot Deviations (PDs)  

A pilot deviation (PD) is an action of a pilot that violates any Federal Aviation Regulation.While PDs should be avoided, theregulations do authorize deviations from a clearance in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory. You must notify ATC as soon as possible following a deviation.  

Pilot deviations can occur in several different ways. Airborne deviations result when a pilot strays from an assigned heading or altitude or from an instrument procedure,orif the pilotpenetrates controlled or restricted airspace without ATC clearance.  

To prevent airborne deviations, follow these steps:  

Plan each flight—-you may have flown the flight many times before but conditions and situations can change rapidly, such as in the case of a pop-up temporary flight restriction (TFR). Take a few minutes prior to eachflightto plan accordingly. Talk and squawk-Proper communication with ATC has its benefits. Flight following often makes the controller's job easier because they can better integrate VFR and IFR traffic. Give yourself some room—GPS is usually more precise than ATC radar. Using your GPS to fly up to and along the line of the airspace you are trying to avoid could result in a pilot deviation because ATC radar mayshow you within the restricted airspace.  

Ground deviations(also called surface deviations)include taxiing, taking off, or landing without clearance, deviating from an assigned taxi route,or failing to hold short of an assigned clearance limit. To prevent ground deviations,stay alert during ground operations. Pilot deviations can and frequently do occur on the ground.Many strategies and tactics pilots use to avoid airborne deviations also work on the ground  

Pilots should also remain vigilant about vehicle/pedestrian deviations(V/PDs).A vehicle or pedestrian deviation includes pedestrians, vehicles or other objects interfering with aircraft operations by entering or moving on the runway movement area without authorization from airtraffic control. In serious instances, any ground deviation (PD or VPD) can result in a runway incursion.Best practices in preventing ground deviations can be found in the following section under runway incursion avoidance.  

# Runway Incursion Avoidance  

A runway incursion is"any occurrence in the airport runway environment involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on theground that creates a collision hazard or results in aloss of required separation with an aircraft taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending to land." It is important to give the same attention to operating on the surface as in other phases of flights. Proper planning can prevent runway incursions and the possibility of a ground collision. A pilot shouldalwaysbeawareoftheaircraft'spositiononthe surfaceatalltimesandbeawareofotheraircraftandvehicle operations on the airport. At times, towered airports can be busy and taxi instructions complex.In thissituation,it may be advisable to write down taxi instructions. The following are some practices to help prevent a runwayincursion:  

Read back all runway crossing and/or hold instructions. Review airport layouts as part of preflight planning. before descending to land and while taxiing,as needed. Know airport signage. Review NOT AM for information on runway/taxiway closures and construction areas. Request progressive taxi instructions from ATC when unsure of the taxi route. Checkfor traffic before crossing any runway holdline andbefore enteringa taxiway. Turn on aircraft lights and the rotating beacon or strobe lights while taxing. When landing, clear the active runway as soon as possible,then waitfortaxi instructions beforefurther movement. Study and use proper phraseology in order to understand and respond to ground control instructions. Write down complex taxi instructions at unfamiliar airports.  

Approximately three runway incursions occur eachdayat towered airports within the United States.Thepotential that these numbers present for a catastrophic accident is unacceptable. The following are examples of pilot deviations, operational incidents(OI),andvehicle(driver)deviations that may lead to runway incursions.  

Pilot Deviations:  

Crossing a runway hold marking without clearance fromATC Taking off without clearance Landing without clearance  

Operational Incidents (O1):  

Clearing an aircraft onto a runway while another aircraft islandingon thesamerunway Issuinga takeoff clearance while the runway is occupied by another aircraft or vehicle  

Vehicle (Driver)Deviations:  

Crossing a runway hold marking without ATC clearance  

According to FAA data,approximately 65 percent of all runway incursions are caused by pilots. Of the pilot runway incursions,FAA data shows almost half of those incursions are caused by GA pilots.  

# Causal Factors of Runway Incursions  

Detailed investigations of runway incursions over thepast 10 years have identified three major areas contributing to theseevents:  

Failure to comply with ATC instructions Lack of airport familiarity Non conformance with standard operating procedures  

Clear, concise, and effective pilot/controller communication is paramount to safe airport surface operations. You must fully understand and comply with all ATC instructions. It is mandatory to read back all runway “hold short” instructions verbatim.  

Taxiing on an unfamiliar airport can be very challenging, especially during hours of darkness or lowvisibility.A request maybe made for progressive taxi instructions which include step by step taxi routing instructions.Ensure you have a current airport diagram, remain "heads-up"with eyes outside,and devote your entire attention to surface navigation per ATC clearance. All checklists should be completed while the aircraft is stopped. There is no place for non-essential chatter or other activities while maintaining vigilance during taxi.[Figure14-48]  

# Runway Confusion  

Runway confusion is a subset of runway incursions and often results in you unintentionally taking off or landing on a taxiway or wrong runway. Generally, you are unaware of the mistake until after it has occurred.  

![](images/effe6e4ab83f3531434ddba253ab2eca7f1dd8e862afe07d344b61737c937f06.jpg)  
Figure 14-48.Heads-up,eyes outside  

In August 2006,theflight crew of a commercial regional jet was clearedfor takeoff onRunway22but mistakenlylined up and departed on Runway 26,a much shorter runway.As a result, the aircraft crashed off the end of the runway.  

# Causal Factors of Runway Confusion  

There are three major factors that increase the riskof runway confusion and can lead to a wrong runway departure:  

Airport complexity Closeproximity of runway thresholds Jointuseof arunway as ataxiway  

Not only can airport complexity contribute to a runway incursion; it can also play a significant role in runway confusion. If you are operating at an unfamiliar airport and need assistance in executing the taxi clearance, do not hesitate to ask ATC for help. Always carry a current airport diagram and trace or highlight your taxi route to the departure runway prior to leaving the ramp.  

If you are operatingfrom an airport with runway thresholds in close proximity to one another,exercise extreme caution whentaxiing ontotherunway.Figure14-49 shows a perfect example of a taxiway leading to multiple runways that may cause confusion.If departing on Runway 36,ensure that you set your aircraft heading"bug"to  $360^{\circ}$  , and align your aircraft to the runway heading to avoid departing from the wrong runway. Before adding power, make one last instrument scan to ensure the aircraft heading and runwayheading are aligned. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use a runway as a taxiway. For example, during airport construction some taxiways may be closed requiring re- routing of traffic onto runways. In other cases, departing traffic maybe required tobacktaxi on therunwayin order to utilize thefull runwaylength  

![](images/494bd88e658c96a30a6987567082dd6c89ef2dc1a5dc6ade3834c4f724f9b70c.jpg)  
Figure14-49.Confusingrunway/runway intersection  

Since in attention and confusion often are factors contributing to runwayincursion,it is important to remain extremely cautious and maintain situational awareness(SA).When instructed to use a runway as a taxiway,do not become confused and take off on the runway you are using as a taxiway.  

# ATC Instructions  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,section 91.123 requires you tofollow all ATC clearances and instructions. Request clarification if you are unsure of the clearance or instruction tobe followed. If you are unfamiliar with the airport or unsure of a taxi route, ask ATC for a "progressive taxi." Progressive taxi requires the controller toprovidestep-by-step taxi instructions.  

The final decision to acton ATC's instruction rests with you If you cannot safely comply with any of ATC'sinstructions, inform them immediately by using the word “UNABLE." There is nothing wrong with telling a controller that you are unable to safely comply with the clearance.  

Another way to mitigate the risk of runway incursions is to write down all taxi instructions as soon as they arereceived fromATC.[Figure14-5o]It is also helpful to monitor ATC clearances and instructions that are issued to other aircraft. You should be especially vigilant if another aircraft has a similar sounding callsign so there is no mistake about who ATC is contacting or to whom they are giving instructions andclearances.  

Read backyour complete ATC clearance withyour aircraft call sign. This gives ATC the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings and ensure that instructions were given to the correct aircraft.If,at any time,thereis uncertainty about any ATC instructions or clearances, ask ATC to“say again' or ask for progressive taxi instructions.  

# ATCInstructions-"HoldShort"  

The most important sign and marking on the airport is the hold sign and hold marking. These are located on a stub taxiwayleading directly to a runway. They depict the holding position or the location where the aircraft is to stop so as not to enter the runway environment.[Figure14-51]Forexample Figure 14-52 shows the holding position sign and marking for Runway 13 and Runway31.  

WhenATCissuesa“holdshort"clearance,youare expected to taxi up to,butnotcross anypart oftherunway holdingmarking.At a towered airport,runwayhold markings should never be crossed without explicit ATC instructions. Do not enter a runway at a towered airport unless instructions are given from ATC to cross,takeoff from,or“lineup andwait"on that specific runway.  

ATCisrequiredtoobtainaread-backfromthepilotof allrunway“holdshort"instructions.Therefore,you mustreadbackthe entire clearance and“holdshort" instruction,toinclude runway identifier andyour call sign.

Figure14-50.A sound practice is to write down taxi instructions fromATC.

Figure14-53shows anexampleofacontroller'staxiand"hold short" instructions and the reply from the pilot.  

# ATC Instructions—Explicit Runway Crossing  

As of June30,2010,ATC isrequired toissue explicit instructions to“cross" or “hold short" of each runway. Instructions to “cross" a runway are normally issued one at a time, and an aircraft must have crossed the previous runway before another runway crossing is issued.Exceptionsmay apply for closely spaced runways that have less than 1,000 feet between centerlines. This applies to all runways to include active,inactive,orclosed.Figure14-54 shows communication between ATC and a pilot who is requesting a taxi clearance. Extra caution should be used when directed by ATC to taxi onto or across a runway, especially at night and during reduced visibility conditions.Always comply with"hold  

![](images/52b170e9fe92a3092f6dfcd6692db9355395f740738383936df1adeba817b5f3.jpg)

short'or crossing instructions when approaching anentrance to a runway.Scan thefull lengthof the runway and thefinal approaches before entering or crossing any runway, even if AT Chas issued a clearance.  

# ATCInstructions—"LineUpandWait"(LUAW  

ATC now uses the“line up and wait"(LUAW)instruction when a takeoff clearance cannot be issued immediately due to traffic or other reasons. The words "line up and wait' have replaced“position and hold"in directing you to taxi onto a runway and await takeoff clearance.  

AnATCinstructionto“lineupandwait"isnotaclearance for takeoff. It is only a clearance to enter the runway and hold in position for takeoff. Under LUA W phraseology, the controller states the aircraft call sign, departure runway, and “"line up and wait." Be aware that “traffic holding in position" will continue to be used to advise other aircraft that traffic hasbeen authorized tolineup andwait on anactiverunway. Pay close attention when instructed to “line up and wait," especially at night or duringperiods of low visibility.Before

Figure14-54.Communication between ATC and a pilot who is requesting taxi procedures.  

entering the runway,remember to s can the full length of the runwayandits approach end for other aircraft.  

There have been collisions and incidents involving aircraft instructed to “line up and wait" while ATC waits for the necessary conditions to issue a takeoff clearance.An OI caused a 737 to landon a runway occupied by a twin-engine turboprop. The turboprop was holding in position awaiting takeoff clearance. Upon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engineturboprop.  

When ATC instructs you to“line up and wait,"they should advise you of any anticipated delay in receiving your takeoff clearance.Possible reasons for ATC takeoff clearance delays mayinclude other aircraft landing and/or departing,wake turbulence,or traffic crossing an intersecting runway  

If advised of a reason for the delay, or the reason is clearlyvisible,expect an imminent takeoff clearance once thereason is nolonger an issue. If a takeoff clearance is not received within 90 seconds after receiving the“line up and wait" instruction, contact ATC immediately. When ATC issues “line up and wait”instructions and takeoff clearances from taxiway intersection,the taxiway design at or is included. Example -“N123AG Runway One-Eight, at Charlie Three, line up and wait. Example-"N123AGRunwayOne-Eight,atCharlie Three,clearedfor takeoff."  

If LUA W procedures are being used and landing traffic is a factor,ATC is required to:  

In form the aircraft in the LUA W position of the closest aircraft that is requesting a full-stop, touch-and-go stop-and-go, option, or unrestricted low approach. Example -“N123AG, Runway One-Eight, line up and wait, traffic a Cessna 210 on a six-mile final. In some cases, where safety logic is being used, ATC is permitted to issue landing clearances with traffic in theLUAWposition.Traffic information is issued to the landing traffic. Example-"N456HK, Runway One-Eight, cleared to land, traffic a DeHavilland Otter holding in position.' NOTE:ATCwill/mustissue a takeoff clearance to the traffic holding in position in sufficient time to ensure no conflict exists with landing aircraft.Prescribed runway separation must exist nolater thanwhen the landing aircraft crosses the threshold.  

In cases where ATC is not permitted to issue landing clearances with traffic in the LUAW position, traffic information is issued to the closest aircraft that is requesting a full-stop, touch-and-go, stop-and-go option,or unrestrictedlow approach. Example -“N456HK,Runway One-Eight, continue, traffic holding in position."  

# ATCInstructions"RunwayShortened'  

You should review NOTAMs in your preflight planning to determine any airport changes thatwill affect your departure or arrival.When the available runwaylengthhas been temporarily or permanently shortened due to construction, the ATIS includes the words “warning” and “shortened" in thetextof themessage.For the duration of the construction when the runway is temporarily shortened,ATC will includetheword“shortened"in their clearance instructions. Furthermore,the use of the term“fulllength"will not be used by ATC during this period of theconstruction.  

Some examples of ATC instructions are:  

"Runway three six shortened, line up and wait." "Runway three six shortened, cleared for takeoff." "Runway three six shortened, cleared to land."  

When anintersection departure is requested on a temporarily or permanently shortened runway during the construction, the remaining length of runway is included in the clearance. For example,“Runway three six at Echo,intersection departure, 5,600feet available." If following the construction, the runway is permanently shortened, ATC will include the word “shortened" until the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerlyAirport/Facility Directory)is updated to include thepermanent changes to the runwaylength  

# Pre-Landing, Landing, and After-Landing  

While en route and after receiving the destination airport ATIS/landing information,review the airport diagram and brief yourself as to your exit taxiway.Determine the following:  

Are there any runway hold markings in close proximity to the exit taxiway? Do not cross any hold markings or exit onto any runways without ATC clearance.  

Afterlanding,usetheutmostcautionwheretheexittaxiways intersect anotherrunway,and donotexit ontoanotherrunway without ATC authorization.Do not accept last minute turnoff instructions from the control tower unless you clearly understand the instructions and are at a speed that ensures you can safely comply. Finally, after landing and upon exiting therunway,ensure your aircraft has completely crossed over the runway hold markings.Once all parts of the aircraft have crossed the runway holding position markings, you must hold unless further instructions have been issued by ATC.Donot initiatenon-essential communications or actions until the aircraft has stopped and the brakes set.  

# Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS)  

Aircraftcananddooverruntheendsofrunwaysand sometimes with devastating results.Anoverrunoccurs when an aircraft passes beyond the end of a runway during anabortedtakeofforonlandingrollout.Tominimizethe hazards of overruns, the FAA incorporated the concept of a runway safety area (RSA)beyond the runway end into airport design standards. At most commercial airports, the RSA is 500 feet wide and extends 1,000 feet beyond each endoftherunway.The FAA implemented this requirement in the event that an aircraft overruns,undershoots,orveers off the side of the runway.  

The most dangerous of these incidents are overruns,but since many airports were built before the 1,0o0-foot RSA length was adopted some 20 years ago, the area beyond the end of the runway is wheremany airports cannot achieve the full standard RSA. This is due to obstacles, such as bodies of water, highways, railroads, populated areas, or severe drop-off of terrain. Under these specific circumstances, the installation of an Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS)is an acceptable alternative to a RSA beyond the runwayend.It provides a level of safety that is generally equivalent to a full RSA.[Figure14-55]  

An EM AS uses materials of closely controlled strength and density placed at the end of a runway to stop or greatly slow an aircraft that overruns the runway. The best material found to date is a lightweight, crushable concrete. When an aircraft rolls into an EM AS arrest or bed,the tires of the aircraft sink into thelightweight concrete and the aircraft is decelerated by having to roll through the material.[Figure14-56]  

# Incidents  

Todate,there have been several incidents listed below where the EM AS technology has worked successfully to arrest aircraft that overrun the runway.All cases have resulted in minimal to do damage to the aircraft. The only known injury was an ankleinjury to a passenger during egress following thearrestment.[Figure14-57]

# EM AS Installations and Information  

Currently,EMASisinstalled at63runwayends at42airports in theUnited States with plans toinstall more throughout the nextfewyears.  

EMAS information is available in the Chart Supplement U.S.(formerly Airport/Facility Directory)under the specific airport information.Figure14-59 shows airport information for Boston Logan International Airport.Atthebottomof the page, it shows which runways are equipped with arresting systems and the type that they have. It is important for pilots to study airport information, become familiar with the details and limitations of the arresting system,and the runways that are equipped with them.[Figure14-60]

# Pilot Considerations  

Although engaging anEMAS should notbe a desired outcome for the end of a flight,pilots need to know what EMAS is, how to identify it on the airfield diagram and ontheairfield,as well as knowing what to do should they find themselves approaching an installation in an overrun situation.[Figure14-59andFigure14-60]Pilotsalsoneed to know that an EMAS may not stop lightweight general aviation aircraft that arenotheavy enoughto sink intothe crushable concrete. The time to discuss whether or not a runway has an EMAS at the end is during the pre-departure briefing prior to takeoff or during the approach briefing prior to commencingthe approach.Following the guidance below ensures that the aircraft engages theEMAS according to the design entryparameters.  

During the takeoff orlandingphase,if a pilotdetermines that the aircraftwillexittherunwayend andenter theEMAS,the following guidance should be adhered to:  

1. Continue deceleration -Regardless of aircraft speed upon exiting the runway,continue to follow Rejected/ Aborted Takeoff procedures,orif landing,Maximum Braking procedures outlined in the Flight Manual.  

![](images/43052cf437979837c7ccdacb1b09b7d16fce74da4dec7fdf8a99bde2c26e30ed.jpg)  
Figure14-57.There have been several incidents where the EM AS has successfully arrested the aircraft  

2. Maintain runway center line-Not veering left or right of the bed and continuing straight ahead will maximize stopping capability of theEMASbed.Thequality of deceleration will be best within the confines of the bed. 3. Maintaindecelerationefforts-The arrestorbedis a passive system, so this is the only action required by thepilot. 4. Oncestopped,do not attempt to taxi or otherwise move theaircraft.

# Chapter 15 Airspace  

# Introduction  

The two categories of airspace are: regulatory and nonregulatory. Within these two categories, there are four types: controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other airspace. The categories and types of airspace are dictated by the complexity or density of aircraft movements, nature Of the operations conducted within the airspace, the level of safety required, and national and public interest. Figure 15-1 presents a profile view of the dimensions of various classes of airspace.Also,there are excerpts from sectional charts that are discussed in Chapter 16, Navigation, that are used to illustrate how airspace is depicted.  

![](images/560354aa7a48411a59ca48229deae87627aeb745b8e81d2babc9b1cfde9dd44f.jpg)  
Figure15-1.Airspaceprofile  

# Controlled Airspace  

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided in accordance with the airspace classification. Controlled airspace consists of:  

Class A Class B Class C Class D Class E  

# ClassAAirspace  

Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000feet mean sea level (MSL) up to and including flight level (FL) 600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12 nauticalmiles(NM)of the coast of the 48 contiguous states andAlaska.Unless otherwise authorized,all operation in Class A airspace is conducted under instrument flightrules (IFR)  

# Class B Airspace  

Class B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 10,0o0feet MSL surrounding the nation's busiest airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually tailored,consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some ClassB airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once anaircraft enters the airspace.ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace.  

# Class C Airspace  

Class C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 4,0oo feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger en plane ment s. Although the configuration of each Class C area is individually tailored,the airspaceusually consists of a surface area with a five NM radius,an outer circle with a tenN M radius that extends from 1,200feetto4,000feetabovethe airport elevation.Each aircraft must establishtwo-wayradio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter must maintain those communications while within the airspace  

# Class D Airspace  

Class D airspace is generally airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation(charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower.The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually tailored and, when instrument procedures are published,the airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures (IAPs) may be Class D or Class E airspace.Unless otherwise authorized,each aircraft must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications while in the airspace.  

# Class E Airspace  

ClassE airspace is the controlled airspace not classified as Class A, B, C,or D airspace.A large amount of the airspace over the United States is designated as Class E airspace.  

Thisprovidessufficient airspacefor thesafe controland separationof aircraft during IFR operations.Chapter3 of the Aeronautical Information Manual(AIM)explains the varioustypesof ClassEairspace.  

Sectional and other chartsdepict all locationsof ClassE airspace with bases below 14,500 feet MSL.In areas where charts do not depict a class E base, class E begins at 14,500 feetMSL.  

In most areas, the Class E airspace base is 1,200 feet AGL. In manyother areas,the ClassE airspacebaseis eitherthesurface or 7o0 feet AGL. Some Class E airspace begins at an MSL altitude depicted on the charts,instead of anAGL altitude.  

ClassE airspace typically extends up to,but not including. 18,0o0feet MSL(thelower limitof Class A airspace).Al airspaceaboveFL600isClassEairspace.  

# Uncontrolled Airspace  

# Class GAirspace  

Uncontrolled airspace or Class G airspace is the portion of the airspace that has not been designated as Class A,B,C, D,or E.It is therefore designated uncontrolled airspace. Class G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the overlyingClassE airspace.Although AT Chas no authority or responsibility to control air traffic,pilots should remember there are visual flight rules(VFR)minimums that apply to ClassGairspace.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace or special area of operation(SAO) is the designation for airspace in which certain activities must be confined, or where limitations may be imposed on aircraft operationsthat arenotpart of thoseactivities. Certain special use airspace areas can create limitations on the mixed use of airspace. The special use airspace depicted on instrument charts includes the area name or number, effective altitude,time andweather conditions of operation, the controlling agency, and the chart panel location. On National Aeronautical Charting Group (NACG) en route charts,this information is available on one of theend panels. Specialuse airspaceusually consistsof:  

Prohibited areas Restricted areas Warning areas Military operation areas (MOAs) Alert areas Controlled firing areas (CFAs)  

# Prohibited Areas  

Prohibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas are established for security or other reasons associated with the national welfare.These areas are published in the Federal Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts.Theareais charted as a "P"followed by a number (e.g., P-40). Examples of prohibited areas include Camp David and theNational Mall in Washington, D.C., where the White House and the Congressional buildings are located. [Figure 15-2]  

# RestrictedAreas  

Restricted areas are areas where operations arehazardousto non participating aircraft and contain airspace within which the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject torestrictions.Activities within these areas must be confined because of their nature,or limitations may beimposed upon aircraft operations that arenot apart of those activities,or both.Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g.,artillery firing, aerial gunnery, or guided missiles). IFR flights may be authorized to transit the airspace and are routed accordingly. Penetration of restricted areas without authorization from the using or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants.ATC facilities apply the following procedures when aircraft are operating on anIFR clearance (including those cleared byATC to maintain VFR on top)via a route thatlieswithin joint-userestricted airspace:  

1.If the restricted area is not active and has been released to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the ATCfacilityallowstheaircrafttooperateinthe restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance for it to do so. 2.If the restricted area is active and has not been released to the FAA,the ATC facility issues a clearance that ensures the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace.  

![](images/e45a489922c92ca639fa8f145b046e3b06a9e93c65f37cf529b0bc20b267d339.jpg)  
Figure15-2.An example of a prohibited area,P-40aroundCamp David.  

Restricted areas are charted with an“R"followedbya number (e.g., R-4401) and are depicted on the en route chart appropriate for use at the altitude or FL being flown. [Figure15-3]Restricted area information can be obtained on the back of the chart.  

# Warning Areas  

Warning areas are similar in nature to restricted areas; however, the United States government does not have sole jurisdiction over the airspace.Awarning areais airspace of defined dimensions, extending from 3 NM outward from the coast of the United States,containing activity that may be hazardous to non participating aircraft. The purpose of such areas is to warn non participating pilots of the potential danger. A warning area may be located over domestic or international waters or both. The airspace is designated with a "W"followed by a number (e.g.,W-237). [Figure 15-4]  

# Military Operation Areas (MoAs)  

MOAs consist of airspacewith definedvertical and lateral limits established for the purpose of separating certain military training activities from IFR traffic. Whenever an MOA is being used, non participating IFR traffic may be cleared through anMOA ifIFR separation canbe provided by ATC. Otherwise, ATC reroutes or restricts non participating IFR traffic. MOAs are depicted on sectional, VFR terminal area,and en route low altitude charts and arenotnumbered (e.g., “Camden Ridge MOA"). [Figure 15-5] However, the MOA is also further defined on the back of the sectional charts with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the controlling agency.  

# AlertAreas  

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an “A" followed by a number (e.g., A-211) to inform non participating  

![](images/8467d06b1b3af25e58f80dde2a5a053dd76ed59d8eb66eb5efd11c06c421103e.jpg)

Figure15-4.Requirements for airspace operations  

pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots should exercise caution in alert areas. All activity within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with regulations, without waiver, and pilots of participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance. [Figure15-6]  

# Controlled Firing Areas (CFAs)  

CF As contain activities that,if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous to non participating aircraft The difference between CF As and otherspecial use airspace is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraftmight be approaching the area. There is no need to chart CFAs since they do not cause a non participating aircraft to change itsflightpath.  

# Other AirspaceAreas  

"Other airspace areas" is a general term referring to the majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:  

Local airport advisory (LAA) Military training route (MTR) Temporary flight restriction (TFR) Parachutejump aircraft operations Published VFR routes Terminal radar service area(TRSA) National security area (NSA) Air Defense Identification Zones(ADIZ)landand water based and need for Defense VFR(DVFR)flight plan to operateVFR in this airspace InterceptProceduresanduseof121.5for communication if not on ATC already

# Local Airport Advisory (LAA)  

An advisory service provided by Flight Service Station (FSS) facilities, which are located on the landing airport, using a discrete ground-to-air frequency or the tower frequency when the tower is closed.LA A services include local airport advisories, automated weather reporting with voice broadcasting,and a continuous Automated Surface Observing System (AsOS)/Automated Weather Observing Station(AWOs) data display,othercontinuous direct reading instruments,ormanual observations availableto the specialist  

# Military Training Routes (MTRs)  

MTR s are routes used by military aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying.These routes are usually established below 1 o,oo 0 feet MSL for operations at speeds in excess of 250knots.Some route segments may be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of routecontinuity.Routes are identified as IFR (IR),and VFR (VR),followed by anumber.[FigureI5-7/MTR s with no segment above 1,500 feet A GLare identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one 0r more segmentsabove1,500feetAGLare identifiedbythree number characters (e.g.,IR206, VR207). IFR 1ow altitude en route charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that

accommodate operations above 1,500feetAGL.IRroutes areconductedin accordance with IFR regardless ofweather conditions. VFR sectional charts depict military training activities, such as IR, VR, MOA, restricted area, warning area,and alert areainformation.  

# Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR  

A flight data center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is issued to designate aT FR.The NOT AM begins with thephrase"FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS"followedbythe location of the temporary restriction, effective time period, area defined in statute miles,and altitudes affected.The NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination facility and telephone number, the reason for the restriction, and any other information deemed appropriate.The pilot should check the NOTAMs aspart of flight planning.  

Some of the purposes for establishing a TFR are:  

Protect persons and propertyin the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard. Providea safe environmentfor the operation of disaster relief aircraft Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event,that may generate a high degree of publicinterest. Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian reasons in the State of Hawaii. Protect thePresident,VicePresident,or other public figures. Provide a safe environment for space agency operations.  

Since the events of September 11, 2001, the use of TFRs has become much more common.There have been a number of incidentsof aircraft incursions into T FRs that have resulted in pilots undergoing security investigations and certificate suspensions. Itis a pilot's responsibility to be aware of TFRs in their proposed area of flight. One way to check is to visit the FAA website, www.tfr.faa.gov, and verify that there is not aT FR in the area.  

# Parachute Jump Aircraft Operations  

Parachute jump aircraft operations are published in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory). Sites that are used frequently are depicted on sectional charts.  

# PublishedVFR Routes  

Published VFR routes are for transitioning around, under, or throughsome complex airspace.Termssuch asVFRflyway, VFR corridor,Class B airspaceVFR transition route,and terminal areaVFR route have been applied to such routes.  

These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area planning charts.  

# Terminal Radar Service Areas(TRSAs)  

TRSAs are areas where participating pilots can receive additional radar services. The purpose of the service is to provide separation between all IFR operations and participating VFR aircraft.  

The primary airport(s)within theTRSA become(s)Class D airspace. The remaining portion of the TRSA overlies other controlled airspace,which is normally ClassE airspace beginning at 700 or 1,200feet and established to transition to/ fromtheenroute/terminal environment.TRS As are depicted onVFR sectional charts and terminal area charts with a solid black line and altitudes for each segment. The Class D portion is charted with a blue segmented line.Participation in TRSA services is voluntary; however, pilots operating under VFR are encouraged to contact the radar approach control and take advantage of TRS A service.  

# National SecurityAreas(NSAs)  

NSAs consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations where there is a requirement for increased security and safety of ground facilities. Flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 99, and prohibitions are disseminated via NOT AM.Pilots are requested to voluntarily avoid flying through these depicted areas.  

# Air Traffic Control and theNational AirspaceSystem  

The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent a collision between aircraft operating in thesystemand to organize and expedite the flow of traffic.In addition to its primaryfunction,the ATC systemhas the capability to provide(with certain limitations) additional services. The ability to provide additional services is limited by many factors, such as the volume of traffic, frequency congestion, quality of radar, controller workload, higher priority duties, and the pure physical inability to scan and detect those situations that fall in this category. It is recognized that these services cannot be provided in cases in which the provision of services is precluded by the abovefactors.  

Consistent with the aforementioned conditions,controllers shall provide additional service procedures to the extent permitted by higher priority duties and other circumstances. The provision of additional services is not optional on the part of the controller, but rather is required when the work situation permits.Provide ATC service in accordance with the procedures and minima in this order except when:  

1.A deviation is necessary to conform toICAO Documents, National Rules of the Air, or special agreements where the United States provides ATC service in airspace outside the country and its possessions 2. Other procedures/minima are prescribed in a letter of agreement, FAA directive, or a military document 3. A deviation is necessary to assist an aircraft when an emergency has been declared  

# Coordinating the Use of Airspace  

ATC is responsible for ensuring that the necessary coordinationhas been accomplished before allowing an aircraft under their control to enter another controller's area ofjurisdiction.  

Before issuing control instructions directly or relaying through another source to an aircraft that is within another controller's area of jurisdiction that will change that aircraft's heading, route, speed, or altitude, ATC ensures that coordination has been accomplished with each of the controllers listed below whose area of jurisdiction is affected by those instructions unless otherwise specified by aletter of agreementor a facility directive:  

1.The controller within whose area of jurisdiction the control instructions are issued 2. The controller receiving the transfer of control 3. Any intervening controller(s) through whose area of jurisdiction the aircraft will pass  

If ATC issues control instructions to an aircraft through a sourceotherthan another controller(e.g.,Aeronautical Radio Incorporated(ARINC),FSS,anotherpilot),theyensurethat the necessary coordination has been accomplished with any controllers listed above, whose area of jurisdictionis affected by those instructions unless otherwise specified by aletter of agreement or a facility directive.  

# Operating in the Various Types of Airspace  

It is important that pilots be familiar with the operational requirementsfor each of thevarious types or classes of airspace. Subsequent sections cover each class in sufficient detail to facilitate understanding regarding weather, type of pilot certificate held, and equipment required.  

# BasicVFRWeatherMinimums  

No pilot may operate an aircraft under basicVFR when the flight visibility is less,or at a distance from clouds that is less, than that prescribed for the corresponding altitude and class of airspace. [Figure 15-8/ Except as provided in 14 CFR part 91,section 91.157,“SpecialVFR WeatherMinimums,"  

![](images/67d734531e94ff8a1ffac962b6cf8ca83859acce115cee2da66a22b6e0cb1d48.jpg)  

no person may operate an aircraftbeneath theceilingunder VFR within the lateral boundaries of controlled airspace designated to thesurfacefor an airport when theceiling is less than1,0o0feet.Additional information canbefound in 14 CFRpart 91,section 91.155(c).  

# OperatingRules andPilot/Equipment Requirements  

The safety offlight is a toppriority of all pilots and the responsibilities associated with operating anaircraft should always be taken seriously. The air traffic system maintains a high degree of safety and efficiency with strict regulatory oversight of the FAA.Pilots fly in accordance with regulations that have served the United States well, as evidenced bythefactthat the country has the safest aviation system in the world.  

All aircraft operating in today's National Airspace System (NAS)has compliedwith the CFRgoverningits certification and maintenance; all pilots operating today have completed rigorous pilot certification training and testing.Of equal importance is the proper execution of preflight planning. aeronautical decision-making (ADM) and risk management. ADM involves a systematic approach to risk assessment and stress management in aviation,illustrate show personal attitudes can influence decision-making,andhowthose attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the flight deck. More detailed information regarding ADM and risk mitigation can be found inChapter 2,“Aeronautical Decision-Making.'  

Pilots also comply with very strict FAA general operating and flight rules as outlined in the CFR, including the FAA's important"see and avoid" mandate. These regulations provide thehistorical foundation of theFAA regulations governing the aviation system and the individual classes of airspace. Figure15-9lists the operational and equipment requirements for these various classes of airspace. It is helpful to refer to this figure as the specific classes are discussed in greater detail.  

# Class A  

Pilots operating an aircraft in Class A airspace must conduct that operation under IFR and only under an ATC clearance received prior to entering the airspace. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC,each aircraft operating in Class A airspacemust beequippedwith a two-wayradiocapable of communicating with ATC on a frequency assigned by ATC. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC,all aircraft within Class A airspace must be equipped with the appropriate transponder equipment meeting all applicable specifications found in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.215. Additionally, beginning January 1,2020,aircraft operating in the Class A airspace described in 14 CFR part 91,section 91.225, musthaveADS-BOut equipment installed,whichmeetsthe performance requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.227.  

# Class B  

All pilots operating an aircraft within a ClassB airspace area must receive an ATC clearance from the ATC facility having jurisdiction for that area. The pilot in command (PIC) may not take of for land an aircraft at an airport within a Class B airspace unless he or she has met one of the following requirements:  

2.A recreational pilot certificate and all requirements contained within 14 CFR part 61, section 61.101(d),or the requirements for a student pilot seeking a recreational pilot certificate in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.94.  

3. A sport pilot certificate and all requirements contained within 14 CFR part 61,section61.325,orthe requirements for a student pilot seeking a recreational pilotcertificatein14 CFRpart61,section61.94,or the aircraft is operated by a student pilot whohas met the requirements of 14CFRpart61,sections61.94 and 61.95, as applicable  

Unlessotherwise authorizedbyATC,all aircraft within Class B airspace must be equipped with the applicable operating transponder and automatic altitude reporting equipment specifiedin14 CFR part 91,section 91.215(a)and an operabletwo-way radio capable of communications with ATC on appropriate frequencies for that Class B airspace area. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, aircraft operatinginthe Class B airspace described in14 CFRpart 91, section 91.225, must have ADS-B Out equipment installed, which meets the performance requirements of 14 CFR part 91,section91.227.  

# Class  $C$  

For the purpose of this section, the primary airport is the airport for which the Class C airspace area is designated.A satellite airportis anyother airportwithin theClassC airspace area.Nopilot may take off or land an aircraft at a satellite airport within a Class C airspace area except in compliance with FAA arrival and departure traffic patterns.  

Two-way radio communications must be established and maintained with the ATC facility providing air traffic services  

![Figure15-9.Requirements for airspace operations ](images/a201e8019e343671fe17bbd9296021f3991c4b5ff45ad51e18ef2a1b228441a4.jpg)  

prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintained while within the airspace.  

A pilot departing from the primary airport or satellite airport with an operating control tower must establish and maintain two-way radio communications with the control tower, andthereafter as instructed by ATC while operatingin the Class C airspace area.If departing from a satellite airport without an operating control tower, the pilot must establish andmaintaintwo-way radio communications with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the Class C airspace area as soon aspracticable after departing  

Unless otherwise authorized by the ATC having jurisdiction over the Class C airspace area, all aircraft within Class C airspace must be equipped with the appropriate transponder equipment meeting all applicable specifications found in 14 CFRpart91,section91.215.Additionally,beginning January 1, 2020, aircraft operating in the Class C airspace described in 14 CFR part 91,section 91.225,must have ADS-B Out equipment installed,which meets the performance requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.227.  

# Class D  

No pilot may take off or land an aircraft at a satellite airport within a Class D airspace area except in compliance with FAA arrival and departure traffic patterns. A pilot departing from the primary airport or satellite airport with an operating control tower must establish and maintain two-wayradio communications with the control tower,andthereafteras instructed by ATC while operating in the Class D airspace area. If departing from a satellite airport without an operating control tower, the pilot must establish and maintain two- way radio communications with the ATC facilityhaving jurisdiction over theClass Dairspace area as soon as practicable afterdeparting.  

Two-way radio communications must be established and maintainedwith the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspaceand thereafter maintained while within the airspace.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot should continue theflight by the route assigned in the last ATC clearance received; or, if being radar vectored, by the direct route from the point of radio failure to the fix,route,or airway specified in thevector clearance.In the absence of an assigned route, the pilot should continue by the route that ATC advised maybe expected in a further clearance; or,if a routehadnotbeen advised,by theroutefiledin the flightplan.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under VFR, the PIC may operatethat aircraft and land if weather conditions are ator abovebasicVFR weatherminimums,visual contact with the tower is maintained,and a clearance to landis received.  

# Class  $E$

# Chapter 16 Navigation  

# Introduction  

This chapter provides an introduction to cross-country flying under visual flight rules (VFR). It contains practical information for planning and executing cross-country flights for the beginning pilot.  

Air navigation is the process of piloting an aircraft from one geographic position to another while monitoring one's position as the flight progresses. It introduces the need for planning, which includes plotting the course on an aeronautical chart,selecting checkpoints,measuring distances,obtaining pertinent weather information, and computing flight time, headings, and fuel requirements. The methods used in this chapter include pilotage——-navigating by reference to visible landmarks, dead reckoning——computations of direction and distance from a known position, and radio navigationby useofradioaids.  

# Aeronautical Charts  

An aeronautical chart is the road map for a pilot flying under VFR. The chart provides information that allows pilots to track theirposition andprovides available information thatenhances safety. The three aeronautical charts used by VFR pilots are:  

Sectional VFR Terminal Area World Aeronautical  

Afree catalog listing aeronautical charts and related publications including prices and instructions for orderingis available at theAeronautical Navigation Products website: www.aeronav.faa.gov.  

# Sectional Charts  

Sectional charts are the most common charts used by pilots today. The charts have a scale of 1:500,000 (1 inch  $=6.86$  nautical miles (NM)or approximately 8 statute miles (SM)), which allows for more detailed information to be included onthechart.  

The charts provide an abundance of information, including airport data,navigational aids,airspace,and topography Figure16-1 is an excerpt from the legend of a sectional chart. By referring to the chart legend, a pilot can interpret most of the information on the chart.A pilot should also check the chart for other legend information, which includes air trafficcontrol(ATC)frequencies and information on airspace.These charts are revised semiannually except fon some areas outside the con term i nous United States where they arerevised annually.  

# VFR Terminal Area Charts  

VFR terminal area charts are helpful when flying in or near Class B airspace. They have a scale of 1:250,000 (1 inch  $=3.43$  NM or approximately 4 SM).These charts provide a more detailed display of topographical information and are revised semi annually,except for several Alaskan and Caribbean charts.[Figure16-2]  

# World Aeronautical Charts  

World aeronautical charts aredesigned toprovide astandard series of aeronautical charts,covering land areas of the world

at a size and scale convenient for navigation by moderate speed aircraft. They are produced at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (1 inch  $=$   $13.7\,\mathrm{NM}$  or approximately 16 SM).These charts are similar to sectional charts,and thesymbols are the same except thereis less detail due to the smaller scale.[Figure 16-3] These charts arerevised annually except several Alaskan charts and the Mexican/Caribbean charts, which are revised every 2 years.  

# Latitude and Longitude(Meridians and Parallels)  

The equatoris animaginary circle equidistant from thepoles of the Earth. Circles parallel to the equator (lines running east andwest)areparallelsoflatitude.Theyareusedtomeasure degrees of latitude north(N)orsouth(S)oftheequator.The angular distance from the equator to the pole is one-fourth ofacircleor  $90°$  .The 48 con term i nous states of theUnited States are located between  $25^{\circ}$  and  $49^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$  latitude.Thearrows in Figure 16-4 labeled"Latitude" point to lines of latitude. Meridians of longitude are drawn from the North Pole to the SouthPoleandareatrightanglestotheEquator.The"Prime Meridian,” which passes through Greenwich, England, is used as the zero line from which measurements are made in degreeseast(E)andwest(W)to  $180^{\circ}$  .The 48 con term i nous states of the United States are between  $67^{\circ}$  and  $125^{\circ}$  W longitude. The arrows in Figure 16-4 labeled "Longitude" point to lines of longitude.  

Any specific geographical point can be located by reference to its longitude and latitude. Washington, D.C., for example is approximately  $39^{\circ}\mathrm{~N~}$  latitude,  $77^{\circ}$  W longitude. Chicago is approximately  $42^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$  latitude,  $88^{\circ}$  W longitude.  

# Time Zones  

The meridians are also useful for designating time zones. A day is defined as the time required for the Earth to make one complete rotation of  $360^{\circ}$  . Since the day is divided into 24 hours,theEarth revolves at therate of  $15^{\circ}$  anhour.Noon is the time when the sun is directly above a meridian; to the west of that meridian is morning,to the east is afternoon.  

![](images/c325a75cd837cb0de4319f4cd6df01f691195c071f3838c9f93374b142065360.jpg)  
Figure16-3.World aeronautical chart  

![](images/662a69f22d22debf07ef968bb6feaecf7352434b57af0ffa441053fa8fc7d37b.jpg)  
Figure16-4.Meridians andparallels—thebasis of measuringtime distance,anddirection.  

The standard practice is to establish a timezone for each  $15^{\circ}$  oflongitude.Thismakes a difference of exactly 1 hour betweeneachzone.In the con term i nous United States, there arefour time zones.The time zones areEastern  $(75^{\circ})$  Central  $(90^{\circ})$  ,Mountain  $(105^{\circ})$  ，andPacific  $(120^{\circ})$  .The dividing lines are somewhat irregular because communities near the boundaries often find it more convenient to use time designations of neighboring communities or trade centers.  

Figure16-5 shows the timezones in the con term i nous United States. When the sun is directly above the 90th meridian, it is noon Central Standard Time.At the same time,itis  $1\,\mathrm{p.m}$  Eastern Standard Time, 11 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, and  $10\;\mathrm{a.m}$  .Pacific Standard Time.When Daylight Saving Time is in effect, generally between the second Sunday in March and the first Sunday in November, the sun is directly above the 75th meridian at noon, Central Daylight Time.  

These time zone differences must be taken intoaccount during long flights eastward—especially if the flight must be completed before dark. Remember, an hour is lost when  

![](images/a6a448b589da18110fb64f28dfa7b400a5e6d2682fa635b980e5062d8c6e26be.jpg)  
Figure16-5.Timezones in the con term i nous United States  

flying eastward from one timezone to another,orperhaps even when flying from the western edge to the eastern edge of thesametimezone.Determine the time of sunset atthe destinationby consulting the flight service station(FSS) and take this into account when planning an eastbound flight.  

In most aviation operations, time is expressed in terms of the 24-hour clock. ATC instructions, weather reports and broadcasts,and estimated times of arrival are all based on this system.For example: 9 a.m.is expressed as  $0900,1\,\mathrm{p.m}$  is1300,and  $10\:\mathrm{p.m}$  .is2200.  

Because a pilot may cross several time zones during a flight, a standard time system has been adopted. It is called Universal CoordinatedTime(UTC)and is often referred to as Zulu time.UTCisthetime atthe  $0^{\circ}$  line of longitude which passes through Greenwich,England.All of the time zones around the world are based on this reference. To convert to this time, a pilot should do the following:  

EasternStandard Time.........Add5hours Central Standard Time .........Add 6 hours Mountain Standard Time......Add 7hours Pacific Standard Time........Add8hours  

For Daylight Saving Time, 1 hour should be subtracted from the calculated times.  

# Measurement of Direction  

By using the meridians,direction from one point to another can be measured in degrees,in a clockwise direction from true north. To indicate a course to be followed in flight. draw a line on the chart from the point of departure to the destination and measure the angle that this line forms with a meridian.Direction is expressed in degrees,as shown by the compassroseinFigure16-6.  

Because meridians converge toward the poles,course measurement should betaken at a meridian near the midpoint of the course rather than at the point of departure.Thecourse measured on the chartis known as the true course (TC). This is the direction measured by reference to ameridian ortrue north(TN).It is thedirection ofintended flight as measured in degrees clockwise from TN.  

As shown in Figure16-7, the directionfrom A toB would be aTCof  $065^{\circ}$  , whereas the return trip (called the reciprocal) wouldbeaTCof  $245^{\circ}$  

![](images/3a4e467aa7753bf467d2f03e920b1490a701372b4e4c8a3ec9fd534d5191bdbf.jpg)  
Figure16-6.Compassrose.  

The true heading (TH) is the direction in which the nose of the aircraft points during a flight when measured in degrees clockwise from TN. Usually, it is necessary to head the aircraft in a direction slightly different from the TC to offset the effect of wind. Consequently, numerical value of the TH may not correspond with that of the TC. This is discussed more fully in subsequent sections in this chapter.For the purpose of this discussion, assume a no-wind condition exists under whichheading and course would coincide.Thus,for aTCof  $065^{\circ}$  ,the TH would be  $065^{\circ}$  .Tousethecompass accurately,however,corrections must be made for magnetic variation and compass deviation.  

# Variation  

Variation is the angle between TN and magnetic north (MN). It is expressed as eastvariation or west variation depending uponwhetherMNistotheeastorwestofTN  

![](images/998afe1f94948a7ffe7bb135566636d2f96bb2bce5dfd15144b0e2d1db974beb.jpg)  
Figure16-7.Courses are determined by reference to meridians on aeronautical charts.  

The north magnetic poleis located close to  $71^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$  latitude,  $96^{\circ}$  W longitude and is about 1,300miles from thegeographic ortruenorthpole,as indicated in Figure I 6-8.IftheEarth were uniformly magnetized, the compass needle would point toward the magnetic pole,in which case the variation between TN (as shown by the geographical meridians) and MN (as shown by themagnetic meridians) could be measured at any intersectionof themeridians.  

Actually,theEarth is not uniformly magnetized.In the United States, the needle usually points in the general direction of the magnetic pole, but it may vary in certain geographical localities by many degrees.Consequently,the exact amount of variation at thousands of selected locations in the United States has been carefully determined.Theamount andthe direction of variation, which change slightly from time to time, are shown on most aeronautical charts as broken magenta lines called isogonic lines that connect points of equal magnetic variation.(The line connecting points at which there is no variation between TN and MN is the ago nic line.）An isogonic chart is shown in Figure 16-9. Minor bends and turns in the isogonic and agonic lines are caused by unusual geological conditions affecting magnetic forces intheseareas.  

On the west coast of the United States, the compass needle points to theeast of TN;on theeast coast,thecompass needle points to the west of TN.  

![](images/4375705bc736b39ebe8744e2012459daa74ac9fdc6e87ba773f7cbe266ef5bca.jpg)  
Figure16-8.Magneticmeridiansareinredwhilethelinesof longitudeandlatitudeareinblue.Fromtheselinesofvariation (magneticmeridians),onecandeterminetheeffectoflocalmagnetic variations on a magnetic compass.  

![](images/70e6c4be13910f1f07e3b0126b80bb3c07734a67491482fe8d1adcc84d12f59c.jpg)  
Figure16-9.Notethe agoniclinewheremagneticvariation iszero.  

Zero degree variation exists on the ago nic line where MN and TN coincide. This line runs roughly west of the Great Lakes, south through Wisconsin,Illinois, western Tennessee,and along the border of Mississippi and Alabama. Compare Figures 16-9and16-10.  

Because courses are measured in reference to geographical meridians that point toward TN,and these courses are maintained by reference to the compass that points along a magnetic meridian in the general direction of MN,thetrue direction must be converted into magnetic direction for the purposeof flight.This conversion is madeby adding or subtracting the variation indicated by the nearest isogonic lineonthechart.  

For example, a line drawn between two points on a chart is called a TC as it is measured from TN. However, flying this course off themagnetic compasswould notprovide an accurate course between the two points due to three elements that must be considered. The first is magnetic variation, the secondis compass deviation,and the thirdis wind correction. All three must be considered for accurate navigation.  

# Magnetic Variation  

As mentioned in the paragraph discussing variation, the appropriate variation for the geographical location of the flight must be considered and added or subtracted as appropriate.If flying across an area where the variation changes,then the values must be applied alongtheroute of flight appropriately. Once applied, this new course is called the magnetic course.  

# Magnetic Deviation  

Because each aircraft has its own internal effect upon the onboard compass systems from its ownlocalized magnetic influencers,the pilot must add or subtract these influence rs based upon the direction he or she is flying. The application of deviation (taken from a compass deviation card) compensates the magnetic course unique to that aircraft's compass system (as affected by localized magnetic influencers) and it now becomes the compass course. Therefore, the compass course, whenfollowed(in a nowindcondition),takesthe aircraft frompoint A to point B eventhough the aircraftheading may not match the original course line drawn on the chart.  

If the variation is shown as  ${}^{\bullet}9^{\circ}\mathrm{~E~}$  ’"thismeans thatMNis  $9^{\circ}$  east of TN. If a TC of  $360^{\circ}$  is to be flown,  $9^{\circ}$  must be subtracted from  $360^{\circ}$  , which results in a magnetic heading of  $351^{\circ}$  .To fly east,a magnetic course of  $081^{\circ}\left(090^{\circ}-9^{\circ}\right)$  would beflown.To fly south,the magnetic course would be  $171^{\circ}\,(180^{\circ}-9^{\circ}).$  To fly west, it would be  $261^{\circ}$   $(270^{\circ}-9^{\circ})$  To fly a TH of  $060^{\circ}$  , a magnetic course of  $051^{\circ}$   $(060^{\circ}-9^{\circ})$  wouldbeflown.  

![](images/9661b0b1d66622cb8d6fa2cd0bb9143040384c2263f4c25c3a0fea8e2aaef080.jpg)  
Figure16-1o.Effect of variation on the compass  

Remember,ifvariation is west,add;if east,subtract.One method for remembering whether to add or subtract variation is the phrase “east is least (subtract) and west is best (add).  

# Deviation  

Determining the magnetic heading is an intermediate step necessary to obtain the correct compass heading for the flight To determine compass heading, a correction for deviation mustbemade.Because of magnetic influences within an aircraft, such as electrical circuits, radio, lights, tools, engine, and magnetized metal parts, the compass needle is frequently deflected from its normal reading. This deflection is called deviation.The deviation is different for each aircraft,and it also may vary for different headings in the same aircraft. For instance, if magnetism in the engine attracts the north end of the compass, there would be no effect when the plane is on a heading of MN. On easterly or westerly headings, however,the compass indications would be in error,asshown in Figure 16-11. Magnetic attraction can come from many other parts of the aircraft;the assumption of attraction in the engine is merely used for the purpose of illustration.  

Some adjustmentof the compass,referred to as compensation can be made to reduce this error, but the remaining correction mustbeappliedbythepilot  

Proper compensation of the compass is best performed by a competent technician.Since the magnetic forces within the aircraft change because of landing shocks,vibration, mechanical work, or changes in equipment, the pilot should occasionally have the deviation of the compass checked.The procedureused to check the deviation is called"swingingthe compass'and is briefly outlined as follows.  

![](images/d0c3bafc2bcb8868b066ac50236af40d1966e721e94342bdcf6031d04328f4e4.jpg)  
Figure16-11.Magnetized portions of the airplane cause the compass to deviate from its normal indications.  

The aircraftis placed on a magnetic compass rose, the engine started,and electrical devices normally used(suchasradio) are turned on. Tailwheel-type aircraft should be jacked up into flyingposition.The aircraft is aligned with MN indicated on the compassrose and thereading shown onthe compass is recorded on a deviation card.The aircraft is then aligned at  $30^{\circ}$  intervals and each reading is recorded. If the aircraft is to be flown at night, the lights are turned on and any significant changes in the readings are noted.If so,additional entries are made for use at night.Theaccuracyof thecompasscan alsobecheckedby comparing the compass reading with the known runway headings.  

A deviation card, similar to Figure 16-12, is mounted near the compass showing the addition or subtraction required to correct for deviation on various headings, usually at intervals of  $30^{\circ}$  .For intermediate readings,the pilot should be able to interpolate mentally with sufficient accuracy.For example if the pilot needed the correction for  $195^{\circ}$  andnotedthe correctionfor  $180^{\circ}$  tobe  $0^{\circ}$  and for  $210^{\circ}$  to be  $+2^{\circ}$  ,itcould be assumed that the correction for  $195^{\circ}$  wouldbe  $+1^{\circ}$  .The magnetic heading, when corrected for deviation, is known as compass heading.  

# EffectofWind  

The preceding discussion explained how to measure aTC on the aeronautical chart and how to make corrections for variation and deviation,but one important factor has not been considered—wind.As discussed in the study of the atmosphere, wind is a mass of air moving over the surface of the Earth in a definite direction. When the wind is blowing from the north at 25 knots, it simply means that air is moving southward over the Earth's surface at the rate of  $25~\mathrm{{NM}}$  in 1 hour.  

Under these conditions, any inert object free from contact with the Earth is carried  $25~\mathrm{{NM}}$  southward in 1hour.This effect becomes apparent when such things as clouds, dust, and toyballoons areobserved beingblown alongby thewind. Obviously, an aircraft flying within the moving mass of air issimilarly affected.Eventhoughthe aircraft doesnotfloat freely with the wind, it moves through the air at the same time the air is moving over the ground, and thus is affected by wind. Consequently, at the end of 1 hour of flight, the aircraft is in a position that results from a combination of the following two motions:  

![Figure16-12.Compass deviation card. ](images/25b8df4595768fbafd8c9b096ea0fd611da2fb1dcd94f42bf95dfd85628e94ef.jpg)  

Movement of the air mass in reference to the ground Forward movement of the aircraft through the air mass  

Actually, these two motions are independent. It makes no difference whether themass of air throughwhich the aircraft is flying is moving or is stationary. A pilot flying in a 70- knot gale would be totally unaware of any wind (except for possible turbulence)unless the ground were observed.In reference to the ground, however, the aircraft would appear to fly faster with a tailwind or slower with a headwind,orto drift right orleft with a crosswind.  

As shown in Figure 16-13,an aircraft flying eastward at an airspeed of 120 knots in still air has a groundspeed (GS) exactly the same—120 knots. If the mass of air is moving eastward at 20 knots,the airspeed of the aircraft is not affected,but the progress of the aircraft over the ground is 120plus20oraGSof140knots.Ontheotherhand,ifthe  

![](images/7907a03a6ac75e2cad26534075dd58f5b3c0bf0a99f3a0f43df226386ebdf519.jpg)  
Figure16-13.Motion of the air affects the speed with which aircraft move over the Earth'ssurface.Airspeed,the rate at which an aircraft moves through the air,is not affected by air motion  

mass of airis movingwestward at20knots,the airspeed of the aircraft remains the same, but GS becomes 120 minus 20or100knots.  

Assuming no correction is made for wind effect,if an aircraft is heading eastward at 120 knots and the air mass moving southward at 20 knots,the aircraft at the end of 1 hour is almost 120 miles east of its point of departure because of its progress through the air. It is 20 miles south because of the motionoftheair.Under these circumstances,theairspeed remains 120 knots, but the GS is determined by combining the movement of the aircraft with that of the air mass. GS can be measured as the distance from the point of departure to theposition of the aircraft at the end of 1 hour. The GS can be computedby the time required toflybetween twopoints a known distance apart. It also can be determined before flight by constructing a wind triangle,which is explained later in thischapter.[Figure16-14]  

The direction in which the aircraft is pointing as it flies is called heading. Its actual path over the ground, which is a combination of the motion of the aircraft and the motion of the air,is called track. The angle between theheading and the track is called drift angle. If the aircraft heading coincides with theTC and the wind is blowing from the left,thetrack does not coincide with the TC.The wind causes the aircraft todrifttotheright,sothetrackfallstotherightofthedesired courseorTC.[Figure16-15]  

The following method is used by many pilots to determine compassheading:after the TC is measured,andwind correction applied resulting inaTH,thesequence  $\mathrm{TH}\ \pm$  variation  $\mathrm{(V)=}$  magnetic heading (MH)  $\pm$  deviation(D)  $=$  compass heading (CH) is followed to arrive at compass heading.[Figure16-16]  

By determining the amount of drift, the pilot can counteract theeffectofthewindandmakethetrackoftheaircraft coincide with the desired course. If the mass of airis moving acrossthecoursefromtheleft,theaircraftdriftstothe right, and a correction must be made by heading the aircraft sufficiently to the left to offset this drift. In other words, if the wind is from the left, the correction is made by pointing the aircraft to the left a certain number of degrees, therefore correcting for wind drift. This is the wind correction angle (WCA) and is expressed in terms of degrees right or left of theTC.[Figure16-17]

# Basic Calculations  

Before a cross-country flight, a pilot should make common calculations for time, speed, and distance, and the amount offuelrequired.  

# Converting Minutes toEquivalent Hours  

Frequently,it is necessary to convert minutes into equivalent hours when solving speed, time, and distance problems. To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60 (60 minutes  $=1$  hour). Thus,30minutesis  $30/60=0.5\$  hour.To converthours to minutes, multiply by 60. Thus, 0.75 hour equals  $0.75\,\times\,60$   $=45$  minutes.  

# Time  $T\,{=}\,D/G S$  

To find the time (T) in flight, divide the distance (D) by the GS.Thetimetofly  $210~\mathrm{{NM}}$  at a GS of 140knots is  $210\div$  140 or 1.5 hours. (The 0.5 hour multiplied by 60 minutes equals30minutes.)Answer:1:30  

# Distance  $D=G S\,X\,T$  

To find the distance flown in a given time, multiply GS by time.The distance flown in 1 hour 45 minutes a taGS of 120 knotsis  $120\times1.75$  Or  $210\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  

#  $G S\;G S=D/T$  

Tofind theGS,divide the distance flownbythe time required.If anaircraftflies  $270~\mathrm{{NM}}$  in3hours,theGS is  $270\div3=90$  knots.  

# Converting Knots toMiles Per Hour  

Another conversion is that of changing knots tomiles per hour (mph). The aviation industry is using knots more frequently thanmph,but is important to understand the conversion for those that use mph when workingwith speed problems.The NWS reports both surface winds and winds aloft in knots. However, airspeed indicators in some aircraft are calibrated in mph (although many are now calibrated in both mph and knots). Pilots, therefore, should learn to convert wind speeds that arereported inknots tomph  

A knot is 1 nautical mile per hour (NMPH). Because there are 6,076.1 feet in 1 NM and 5,280 feet in 1 SM, the conversion factor is 1.15. To convert knots to mph, multiply speed in knots by 1.15. For example: a wind speed of 20 knots is equivalentto  $23\;\mathrm{mph}$  

Most flight computers or electronic calculatorshave a means of making this conversion. Another quick method of conversion is to use the scales of NM and SM at the bottom of aeronautical charts.  

# Fuel Consumption  

To ensure that sufficient fuel is available for your intended flight,you must be able to accurately compute aircraft fuel consumption during preflight planning. Typically, fuel consumption in gasoline-fueled aircraft is measured in gallonsperhour.Since turbine engines consumemuch more fuel than reciprocating engines, turbine-powered aircraft require much more fuel,and thus muchlarger fuel tanks. When determining these large fuel quantities,using avolume measurement such as gallons presents a problem because the volume of fuel varies greatly in relation to temperature. In contrast, density (weight) is less affected by temperature andtherefore,provides a more uniform and repeatable measurement.For thisreason,jetfuel is generally quantified by its density and volume.  

This standard industry convention yields a pounds-of-fuel- per-hourvaluewhich,when divided into the nautical miles (NM)perhouroftravel(  $\mathrm{TAS\pm}$  winds)value,resultsina specific range value.The typical label for specific range is NM per pound of fuel,oroftenNMper1,oo0poundsof fuel. Preflight planning should be supported by proper monitoring of past fuelconsumption as well as use of specified fuel management and mixture adjustment procedures in flight For simple aircraft with reciprocating engines, the Aircraft FlightManual/Pilot's Operating Handbook(AFM/POH) supplied by the aircraft manufacturer provides gallons-per- hour values to assist with preflight planning.  

When planning a flight, you must determine how much fuel is needed to reach your destination by calculating the distance the aircraft can travel(with winds considered)at a known rate of fuel consumption (gal/hr or lbs/hr) for the expected ground speed(GS)andensure this amount,plus an adequatereserve,is available onboard.GSdeterminesthe time the flight will take.The amount of fuelneededfor a givenflight can be calculated by multiplying the estimated flight time by the rate of consumption. For example, a flight Oof  $400\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  at 100 knots GS takes 4 hours to complete. If an aircraft consumes 5 gallons of fuel per hour, the total fuel consumption is 20 gallons(4 hours times 5 gallons).Inthis example,thereisnowind;therefore,trueairspeed(TAS) isalso1ooknots,thesameasGS.Since the rate of fuel consumption remains relatively constant at a given T AS, youmustuseGSto calculate fuel consumption when wind is present. Specific range (NM/ib or  $\mathrm{{NM}/\mathrm{{gad})}}$  isalsouseful in calculating fuel consumption when wind is a factor.  

You should always plan to be on the surface before any of thefollowing occur:  

Your flight time exceeds the amount of flight time you calculated for the consumption of your preflight fuelamount Yourfuel gauge indicates low fuel level  

The rate of fuel consumption depends on many factors: condition of the engine, propeller/rotor pitch, propeller/ rotor revolutions per minute (rpm),richness of the mixture, and the percentage of horsepower used for flight at cruising speed.The pilot should know the approximate consumption rate from cruise performance charts or fromexperience. In addition to the amount of fuel required for the flight. there should be sufficient fuel for reserve.Whenestimating consumption you must plan for cruise flight as well as startup and taxi, and higher fuel burn during climb. Remember that ground speed during climb is less than during cruise flight at the same airspeed.Additional fuel for adequate reserve should alsobe added as a safetymeasure.  

# Flight Computers  

Up to this point, only mathematical formulas have been used to determine such items as time,distance,speed,and fuel consumption.In reality,most pilotsuse a mechanical flight computer called a nE 6 Bor electronic flight calculator.These devices can compute numerous problems associated with flight planning and navigation.Themechanical orelectronic computer has an instruction book that probably includes sample problems so the pilot can become familiar with its functions and operation.[Figure16-18]  

# Plotter  

Another aid in flight planning is a plotter, which is a protractor and ruler. The pilot can use this when determining TC and measuring distance.Most plotters have aruler thatmeasures in both NM and SM and has a scale for a sectional chart on one side and a world aeronautical chart onthe other.[Figure16-18]  

# Pilotage  

Pilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks or checkpoints. It is a method of navigation that can be used on any course that has adequate checkpoints, but it is more commonly used in conjunction with dead reckoning and VFR radio navigation.  

Thecheckpoints selected should be prominent features common to the area of theflight.Choose checkpoints thatcan be readily identified by other features, such as roads, rivers, railroad tracks,1akes,and power lines.If possible,select features that make useful boundaries or brackets on each side of the course, such as highways, rivers, railroads, and mountains.A pilot can keep from driftingtoofar off course by referring to and not crossing the selected brackets. Never place completerelianceon anysinglecheckpoint.Choose ample checkpoints. If one is missed, look for the next one while maintaining theheading.When determining position from checkpoints,remember that the scale of a sectional chart is 1 inch  $=\!8$  SMor6.86NM.Forexample,if a checkpoints elected was approximately one-half inch from the course line on the chart,itis4SM or  $3.43\;\mathrm{{NM}}$  from the course on the ground. In the more congested areas,someof the smaller features are not included on the chart. If confused, hold the heading. If a turn is made away from the heading, it is easy to become lost  

Roads shown on the chart are primarily the well-traveled roads or those most apparent when viewed from the air. New roads and structures are constantly being built and may not be shown on the chart until the next chart is issued. Some structures, such as antennas,may be difficult to see. Sometimes TV antennas aregrouped togetherin an area near a town.They are supported by almost invisible guy wires. Never approachan area of antennas less than 5 o 0 feet above thetallestone.Most of the taller structures are marked with strobe lights to make them more visible to pilots. However, some weather conditions orbackground lighting may make them difficult to see.Aeronautical charts display the best information available at the time of printing, but a pilot should be cautious for new structures or changes that have occurred since the chart was printed.

# Dead Reckoning  

Dead reckoningis navigation solely by means of computations based on time, airspeed, distance, and direction. The products derived from these variables, when adjusted by wind speed and velocity, are heading and GS. The predicted heading takes the aircraft along the intended path and theGS establishes the time to arrive at each checkpoint and the destination. Except for flights over water, dead reckoning is usually used with pilotage for cross-country flying. The heading and GS, as calculated, is constantly monitored and corrected by pilotage as observed from checkpoints  

# Wind Triangle or Vector Analysis  

If there is no wind,the aircraft's ground track is the same as the heading and the GS is the same as the true airspeed. This condition rarely exists.Awind triangle,thepilot'sversion of vector analysis,is the basis of dead reckoning  

The wind triangle is a graphic explanation of the effect of wind upon flight. GS, heading, and time for any flight can be determined by using the wind triangle. It can be applied to the simplest kind of cross-country flight, as well as the most complicated instrument flight. The experienced pilot becomes so familiar with the fundamental principles that estimates can be made that are adequate for visual flight without actually drawing the diagrams.The beginning student,however,needs to develop skill in constructing these diagrams as an aid to the complete understanding of windeffect.Either consciously or unconsciously,every good pilot thinks of theflight in terms ofwindtriangle  

If flight is to be made on a course to the east, with a wind blowing from the northeast, the aircraft must be headed somewhat to the north of east to counteract drift. This can be represented by a diagram as shown in Figure 16-19.Each line represents direction and speed. The long blue and white hashed line shows the direction the aircraft is heading, and its length represents the distance traveled at the indicated airspeed for 1 hour. The short blue arrow at the right shows the wind direction, and its length represents the wind velocity for 1 hour. The solid yellow line shows the direction of the trackorthepathof the aircraft asmeasuredovertheearth,and its length represents the distance traveled in 1 hour or the GS.  

In actual practice, the triangle illustrated in Figure 16-19 is not drawn; instead, construct a similar triangle as shown by the blue, yellow, and black lines in Figure 16-20, which is explained in thefollowing example.  

Suppose a flight is to be flown from E to P. Draw a line on the aeronautical chart connecting these two points; measure its direction with a protractor, or plotter, in reference to a meridian. This is the TC, which in this example is assumed tobe  $090^{\circ}$  (east).From theNWS,itis learned that the wind at the altitude of the intended flight is 40knots from the northeast  $(045^{\circ})$  .Since theNwS reports the wind speed in knots,if the true airspeed ofthe aircraft is 120knots,there is noneed to convert speeds from knots to mph or viceversa.  

Now, on a plain sheet of paper draw a vertical line representing north tosouth.(Thevarious steps are shown in Figure 16-21.)  

# Step 1  

Place the protractor with the base resting on thevertical line and the curved edge facing east.At the center point of the base, make a dot labeled “E" (point of departure) and at the curved edge,make a dot at  $90^{\circ}$  (indicating the direction of the true course)and another at  $45^{\circ}$  (indicating wind direction).  

![](images/9bd0d6dc53c7c6ddab93aef5d28666201c51c82d22ca51ddee18de7c53b351a1.jpg)

Figure16-21.Steps in drawing thewind triangle  

# Step 2  

With the ruler, draw the true course line from E, extending it somewhat beyond the dot by  $90^{\circ}$  ,andlabelingit"TC  $090^{\circ}$  

# Step 3  

Next, align the ruler with E and the dot at  $45^{\circ}$  ，anddraw the wind arrow from E, not toward  $045^{\circ}$  ,butdownwindin the direction the wind is blowing making it 40 units long to correspond with the wind velocity of 40 knots.Identifythis line as the wind line by placing the letter “w" at the end to show the wind direction.  

# Step4  

Finally, measure 120 units on the ruler to represent the airspeed, making a dot on the ruler at this point. The units used maybe of any convenient scale or value(suchas  $\%$  inch  $=10$  knots),but once selected, the same scale must be used for each of the linear movements involved.Then place the ruler so that the end is on the arrowhead(W)and the 120-knot dot intercepts the TC line. Draw the line and labelit“AS120."Thepoint“P"placed at the intersection represents the position of the aircraft at the end of 1 hour. The diagram is now complete.  

The distance flown in1 hour(GS)is measured as the numbers ofunitsontheTCline(88NMPHor88knots).TheTH necessary to offset drift is indicated by the direction of the airspeedline,which can be determined in one of two ways:  

By placing the straight side of the protractor along the north-south line, with its center point at the intersection of the airspeed line and north-southline, read theTH directlyin degrees  $(076^{\circ})$  .[Figure16-22] By placing the straight side of theprotractor along the TC line, with its center at P, read the angle between the TC and the airspeed line. This is the WCA,which mustbeappliedtotheTCtoobtaintheTH.Ifthewind blows from the right of TC, the angle is added; if from the left, it is subtracted. In the example given, the WCAis  $14^{\circ}$  and the wind is from the left; therefore, subtract  $14^{\circ}$  from TC of  $090^{\circ}$  ,making the TH  $076^{\circ}$  [Figure16-23]  

After obtaining the TH, apply the correction for magnetic variation to obtain magnetic heading and the correction for compass deviation to obtain a compassheading.The compass heading canbe used tofly to the destination by dead reckoning.  

To determine the time and fuel required for the flight, first find the distance to your destination by measuring the length of thecourseline drawn on the aeronautical chart(using the appropriate scale at thebottom of the chart). If the distance measures  $220\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  divide by the GS of 88 knots,whichgives 2.5 hours, or 2:30, as the time required. If fuel consumption is 8 gallons an hour,  $8\,\times\,2.5$  or about 20 gallons is used.

Briefly summarized, the steps in obtaining flight informatior areasfollows:  

TC—direction of the line connecting two desired points,drawn on the chart and measured clockwise in degrees from TN on the mid-meridian WCA—determined from the wind triangle. (Added to TC if the wind is from the right; subtracted if wind isfromtheleft) TH direction measured in degrees clockwise from TN,in which the nose of the plane should point to remainonthedesiredcourse  

Variation—obtained from the is og onic line on the chart (added to TH if west; subtracted if east) MH—an intermediate step in the conversion (obtained by applying variation to TH) Deviation obtained from the deviation card on the aircraft(added to or subtracted from MH,asindicated) Compass headingreading on the compass (found by applying deviation to MH) that is followed to remain onthedesiredcourse  

Total distance obtained by measuring the length of the TC line on the chart(using the scale at the bottom ofthechart) GS—obtained bymeasuring thelengthof theTCline on the wind triangle (using the scale employed for drawing the diagram) Estimated time en route (ETE)—total distance divided byGS Fuel rate—predetermined gallons per hour used at cruisingspeed  

NOTE:Additional fuel for adequate reserve should be added as a safety measure.  

# Flight Planning  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 states, in part, that before beginning a flight, the pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft shall become familiar with all available information concerning that flight. For flights not in the vicinity of an airport, this must include information on available current weather reports and forecasts,fuel requirements, alternatives available if the planned flight cannot be completed,and any known traffic delays ofwhich the PIC has been advised by ATC  

# Assembling Necessary Material  

Thepilotshould collectthenecessarymaterialwellbefore beginning the flight. An appropriate current sectional chart and charts for areas adjoining the flight route should be among this material if the route of flight is near the border of a chart.  

Additional equipment should include a flight computer or electronic calculator, plotter, and any other item appropriate to the particular flight. For example, if a night flight is to be undertaken,carry a flashlight; if a flight is over desert country,carry a supply of water and other necessities.  

# Weather Check  

It is wise to check the weather before continuing with other aspects of flight planning to see,first of all, if the flight is feasible and,ifitis, which route is best. Chapter 12,“Aviation WeatherServices,”discusses obtaining a weather briefing  

# Use of Chart Supplement U.S.(formerly Airport) Facility Directory)  

Study available information about each airport at which a landing is intended.This should include a study of the Notices toAirmen(NOTAMs）andtheChartSupplementU.S.(formerlyAirport/Facility Directory).[FigureI6-24/This includes location, elevation, runway and lighting facilities, available services,availability of aeronautical advisory station frequency (UNICOM), types of fuel available (use to

The sectional chart bulletin subsection should be checked for major changes that have occurred since the last publication date of each sectional chart being used.Remember, the chart may be up to 6 months old.The effective date of the chart appears at the top of the front of the chart.The Chart Supplement U.S generally has the latest information pertaining to such matters and should be used in preference to the information on the backofthechart,if there are differences.  

# Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot'sOperating Handbook(AFM/POH)  

The Aircraft Flight Manual or Pilot's Operating Handbook (AFM/POH)should be checked to determine the proper loading of the aircraft (weight and balance data). The weight of theusablefuel anddrainableoil aboard must be known. Also, check the weight of the passengers, the weight of all baggage to be carried, and the empty weight of the aircraft to be sure that the total weight does not exceed the maximum allowable weight. The distribution of theload must beknown to tellif the resulting center ofgravity(CG)iswithinlimits.  

Be sure to use the latest weight and balance information in theFAA-approved AFM or other permanent aircraft records, as appropriate,to obtain empty weight andemptyweight CGinformation.  

Determine the takeoff and landing distances from the appropriate charts,based on the calculated load,elevation ofthe airport,andtemperature;then compare these distances with the amount of runway available.Remember,the heaviertheloadandthehighertheelevation,temperature or humidity, the longer the takeoff roll and landing roll and the lower the rate of climb  

Check the fuel consumption charts to determine the rate of fuelconsumption at the estimated flight altitude and power settings.Calculate therate of fuel consumption,and compare itwith theestimated time for the flight so that refueling points along the route can be included in the plan.  

# Charting the Course  

Once the weather has been checked and some preliminary planning completed,it is time to chart the course and determine the data needed to accomplish the flight.The following sections provide alogical sequence tofollow in charting the course, complete a flight log, and filing a flight plan. In the following example, a trip is planned based on the following data and the sectional chart excerpt in Figure 16-25  

Route of flight: Chickasha Airport direct to Guthrie Airpor  

True airspeed (TAS).. .115 knots Winds aloft.  $.360^{\circ}$  at 10 knots Usable fuel. 38 gallons Fuel rate.. .8 GPH Deviation.  $+2^{\circ}$  

# Steps in Charting the Course  

Thefollowingis a suggested sequencefor arriving at the pertinent information for the trip.As information is determined it may be noted as illustrated in the example of a flight log in Figure16-26.Where calculations arerequired,the pilot may use a mathematical formula or a manual or electronic flight computer.If unfamiliar with the use of a manual or electronic computer,it would be advantageous to read the operation manual and work several practice problems at this point.  

First, draw a line from Chickasha Airport (point A) directly to Guthrie Airport(pointF).The course line should begin at thecenteroftheairportofdepartureandendatthecenterof the destination airport.If the route is direct,thecourseline consists of a single straight line.If the route is not direct,it consists of two or more straight line segments.For example, a VOR station that is off the direct route, but makes navigating easier,may be chosen (radio navigation is discussed later in thischapter).  

Appropriate checkpoints should be selected alongtheroute and noted in some way.These should be easy-to-locate points,such as large towns,largelakes and rivers,or combinations of recognizable points,suchastownswith an airport, towns with a network of highways, and railroads entering and departing.  

Normally,choose only towns indicated by splashes of yellow on the chart. Do not choose towns represented by a small circle——these may turn out to be only a half-dozen houses.(In isolated areas, however, towns represented by a small circle can be prominent checkpoints.) For this trip, four checkpoints have been selected.Checkpoint1 consistsof a towerlocated east of the course and can be further identified by the highway and railroad track, which almost parallels the course at this point.Checkpoint 2 is the obstruction just to the west of the course and canbefurther identified byWill RogersWorld Airport, which is directly to the east. Checkpoint 3 is Wiley PostAirport,which the aircraft should fly directly over. Checkpoint 4is a private,non-surfaced airport to the west of the course and can be further identified by the railroad track and highway to the east of the course.  

The course and a reason either side of the planned route should be checked to determine if there is any type of airspace with which the pilot should be concerned or which has special operational requirements. For this trip, it should be noted that the coursepasses through asegment of the Class C airspace surrounding Will Rogers World Airport where the floor of the airspace is 2,500 feet mean sealevel (MSL) and the ceiling is 5,300 feet MSL (point B).Also, there is Class D airspacefrom the surface to3,800feetMSL surrounding WileyPost Airport(point C)during thetime thecontrol tower is in operation.  

Study the terrain and obstructions along the route. This is necessary to determine the highest and lowest elevations, as well as the highest obstruction to be encountered so an appropriate altitude that conforms to 14 CFR part 91 regulations can be selected.If theflight istobeflown atanaltitudeofmorethan3,ooofeetabovetheterrain, conformance to the cruising altitude appropriate to the direction offlightis required.Check the route for particularly rugged terrain so it can be avoided.Areas where a takeoff or landing is made should be carefully checked for tall obstructions.Television transmitting towers may extend to altitudes over 1,500feet above the surrounding terrain. It is essential that pilots be aware of their presence andlocation. For this trip, it should be noted that the tallest obstruction is

![Figure16-26.Pilot'splanningsheet and visual flight log ](images/a5d485e7c8ee4eded7046d6ee927242ac22897a43090ddf31c9e2e1dd4c9cd41.jpg)  

part of a series of antennas with a height of 2,749 feet MSL (point D).The highest elevation should belocated in the northeast quadrant and is 2,900feet MSL (point E)  

Since the wind is no factor and it is desirable and within the aircraft's capability tofly above the Class C and D airspace to be encountered, an altitude of 5,500 feet MSL is chosen. Thisaltitude alsogives adequate clearance of all obstructions. as well as conforms to the 14 CFR part 91 requirement to fly at an altitude of odd thousand plus 5 o 0 feet when on a magnetic course between O and  $179^{\circ}$  

Next, the pilot should measure the total distance of the course, as well as the distance between checkpoints.The total distanceis  $53\;\mathrm{{NM}}$  ,and the distancebetween checkpoints is as noted on the flight log in Figure 16-26  

After determining the distance, the TC should be measured. If using a plotter, follow the directions on the plotter. The TC is  $031^{\circ}$  . Once the TH is established, the pilot can determine the compass heading. This is done by following the formula given earlier in this chapter.  

The formula is:  

#  $\mathrm{TC}\pm\mathrm{WCA}=\mathrm{TH}\pm\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{MHz}\pm\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{CH}$  

The WCA can be determined by using a manual or electronic flight computer. Using a wind of  $360^{\circ}$   at 10 knots, it is determined the WC A is  $3^{\circ}$  left.This is subtracted from the TC making the  $\mathrm{TH}~28^{\circ}$  . Next, the pilot should locate the is og onic line closest to the route of the flight to determine variation.Figure16-25 shows the variation to be  $6.30^{\circ}\mathrm{~E~}$  (rounded to  $7^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}$  ),which means it should be subtracted from the TH, giving an MH of  $21^{\circ}$  . Next, add  $2^{\circ}$  to the MH for the deviation correction. This gives the pilot the compass  $23^{\circ}$  heading of  

Now, the GS can be determined. This is done using a manual or electronic calculator.The GS is determined to be 106 knots.Based on thisinformation,the total trip time,as well as time between checkpoints,and the fuel burned can be determined. These numbers can be calculated by using a manual or electronic calculator.  

For this trip,the GS is 106knots and the total time is 35 minutes(30minutesplus 5minutesfor climb)with a fuel burn of 4.7gallons.Refer to theflightlog inFigure16-26 for the time between checkpoints.  

As the trip progresses, the pilot can note headings and time and make adjustments inheading, GS, and time.  

# Filing aVFR Flight Plan  

Filing a flight plan is not required by regulations; however, it is a good operating practice since the information contained in the flight plan can be used in search and rescue in the event of an emergency.  

Flight plans can be filed in the air by radio, but it is best to fileaflight plan by phone just before departing.Aftertakeoff contact the FSs by radio and give them the takeoff time so the flight plan can be activated.  

When a VFR flight plan is filed, it is held by the FSS until 1 hour after the proposed departure time and then canceled unless:the actual departure time is received;a revised proposed departure time is received; or at the time of filing, the FSS is informed that the proposed departure time is met, but actual time cannot be given because of inadequate communication.The FS S specialist who accepts the flight plan doesnotinform thepilot of this procedure,however.  

Figure16-27 shows the flight planform a pilot files with the FSS. When filing a flight plan by telephone or radio, give the information in the order of the numbered spaces.This enables theFSS specialist tocopy theinformation more efficiently.Most of thefields areeitherself-explanatory ornon-applicable to the VFR flight plan(suchasitem13)) However, somefields mayneed explanation.  

Item 3 is the aircraft type and special equipment. An examplewouldbeC-150/X,which means the aircraft has no transponder. A listing of special equipment codes is found in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Item 6 is the proposed departure time in UTC (indicated by the“Z""). Item 7 is the cruising altitude. Normally, "VFR" can be entered in this block since the pilot chooses acruising altitude to conform to FAA regulations.  

![](images/2034aa4a85f96be014369b98f857a1abd431c9e1529b4a8a5fa5a243a7dcf67d.jpg)  
Figure 16-27.Domestic flight plan form  

Item 8 is the route of flight. If the flight is to be direct entertheword"direct;”if not,enter the actualroute to be followed, such as via certain towns or navigation aids. Item 10 is the estimated time en route.In the sample flight plan, 5 minutes was added to the total time to allow for the climb Item12is thefuel onboardinhours and minutes.This is determined by dividing the total usablefuel aboard in gallons by the estimated rate of fuel consumption ingallons.  

Remember, there is every advantage in filing a flight plan; but do not forget to close the flight plan upon arrival. This should be done via telephone to avoid radio congestion.  

# Ground-BasedNavigation  

Advances in navigational radio receivers installed in aircraft the development of aeronautical charts that show theexact location of ground transmitting stations and their frequencies, alongwithrefinedflightdeckinstrumentationmakeit possible for pilots to navigatewith precision to almost any point desired. Although precision in navigation is obtainable through the proper use of this equipment, beginning pilots should use this equipment to supplement navigation by visual reference to the ground (pilotage). This method provides the pilotwith an effective safeguard against disorientation in the event of radio malfunction.  

There are three radionavigation systems availablefor use for VFR navigation.These are:  

VHF Omni directional Range(VOR) Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB) Global Positioning System(GPS)  

# Very HighFrequency(VHF) Omnidirectional Range(voR)  

TheVOR system is present in three slightly different navigation aids (NAVAIDs): VOR,VOR/distance measuring equipment (DME)(discussed in a later section), and VORTAC.By itself it is known asaVOR,and itprovides magnetic bearing information to and from the station. When D ME is also installed with a VOR,the NAVA iD is referred to as a VOR/DME.When military tactical air navigation (TACAN) equipment is installed with a VOR, the NAVAID is known as a VORTAC. DME is always an integral part of aVORTAC.Regardlessof the typeof NAVAIDutilized (VOR,VOR/DME,orVORTAC),theVORindicator behaves the same.Unless otherwise noted in this section, VOR,VOR/DME,and V ORTAC NAV AIDs are all referred to hereafter as VOR s.  

The prefix“omni-"means all, and an omnidirectional range is a VHF radio transmitting ground station that projects straight line courses(radials)from the station in all directions. From atopview,it can be visualized as being similar to the spokes from thehub of a wheel.The distanceVOR radials are projected depends upon the power output of thetransmitter.  

The course or radials projected from the station are referenced to MN. Therefore, a radial is defined as a line of magnetic bearing extending outward from theVORstation.Radials are identified by numbers beginning with 001, which is  $1^{\circ}$  east of MN and progress in sequence through all the degrees of a circle until reaching 360.To aid inorientation,acompass rose reference tomagnetic north is superimposed on aeronautical charts at the station location.  

VORground stations transmit within a VHF frequency band of 108.0-117.95 MHz. Because the equipment is VHF, the signals transmitted are subject to line-of-sight restrictions. Therefore, its range varies in direct proportion to the altitude of receiving equipment. Generally, the reception range of the signals at an altitude of 1,ooo feet above ground level (AGL)is about 40 to 45miles. This distance increases with altitude.[Figure16-28]  

![](images/d3f6d47c6cf857fa75a6e6044c639a7ce3644889f2ee79c9563896b833c01002.jpg)  
Figure16-28.VHF transmissions follow a line-of-sightcourse  

VORs and VORTACs are classed according to operational use.There are three classes:  

T (Terminal) L (Low altitude) H (High altitude)  

The normal useful range for the various classes is shown in the following table:

Theuseful range of certain facilities maybeless than 50 miles. For further information concerning these restrictions, refer to the Communication/NAVA ID Remarks in the Chart SupplementU.S.  

Theaccuracyof course alignment of VoRradialsis considered tobe excellent. It is generally within plus or minus  $1^{\circ}$  . However, certain parts of the VOR receiver equipment deteriorate, affecting its accuracy. This is particularly true at great distances from theVOR station. The best assurance of maintaining an accurate VOR receiver is periodic checks and calibrations. VOR accuracy checks are not a regulatory requirement for VFR flight.However,to assure accuracy of the equipment, these checks should be accomplished quite frequently and a complete calibration should be performed each year. The following means are provided for pilots to check VoR accuracy:  

FAA VOR test facility(VOT) Certified airborne checkpoints Certified ground checkpoints located on airport surfaces  

If an aircraft has two VOR receivers installed, a dual VOR receiver check can be made. To accomplish the dual receiver check, a pilot must tune bothVOR receivers to the sameVOR groundfacility.Themaximumpermissiblevariationbetween the two indicated bearings is  $4^{\circ}$  .A list of the airborne and ground checkpoints is published in the Chart Supplement U.S.  

Basically,these checks consist of verifying that the VOR radials the aircraft equipment receives are aligned with the radials the station transmits.There are not specific tolerances in VOR checks required for VFR flight.Butasaguideto assure acceptable accuracy,the required IFR tolerances can beused-  $\pm4^{\circ}$  for ground checks and  $\pm6^{\circ}$  for airborne checks. These checks can be performed by the pilot  

The VOR transmitting station can be positively identified by its Morse code identification or by a recorded voice identification that states the name of the station followed by "VOR." Many FSSs transmit voice messages on the same frequency that theVOR operates.Voice transmissions should not be relied upon to identify stations because many F SSs remotely transmit over several omniranges thathave names different from that of the transmitting FS S.IftheVORis out of service for maintenance, the coded identification is removed and not transmitted.This serves to alert pilots that thisstation should not beusedfor navigation.VOR receivers are designed with an alarm flag to indicatewhen signal strength is inadequate to operate the navigational equipment. This happens if the aircraft is too far from the VOR or the aircraft is too low and,therefore,is out of the line of sight of the transmitting signals.  

# Using the VOR  

Inreview,for VOR radio navigation,therearetwo components required:ground transmitter and aircraft receiving equipment. The ground transmitter is located at a specific position on the ground and transmits on an assigned frequency. The aircraft equipment includes a receiver with a tuning device and a VOR or omninavigation instrument. The navigation instrument could be a course deviation indicator (CDI), horizontal situation indicator (HSI), or a radio magnetic indicator(RMl).Eachof these instruments indicates the course to the tune dVOR.  

# Course Deviation Indicator (CDl)  

The CDIis found in most training aircraft.It consists of an omnibearing selector (OBS) sometimes referred to as the course selector, a CDI needle (left-right needle), and a TO/ FROMindicator.  

The courses elector is an azimuth dial that can be rotated to select a desired radial or to determine the radial over which the aircraft is flying. In addition, the magnetic course “TO" or“FROM"the station canbe determined.  

When the course selector is rotated, it moves the CDI or needle to indicate the position of the radial relative to the aircraft.If the courses elector is rotated until the deviation needle is centered,theradial(magneticcourse"FROM"the station)oritsreciprocal(magneticcourse“TO"thestation) canbedetermined.Thecoursedeviationneedlealsomoves to the right or left if the aircraft is flown or drifting away from the radial which is set in the courses elector.  

Bycenteringtheneedle,thecourseselectorindicateseither thecourse"FROM"the station or the course"TO"thestation. If theflagdisplays a"TO,”the course shown on thecourse selector must be flown to the station.[Figure16-29]If “FROM"is displayed and the course shown is followed,the aircraft is flown away from the station.  

# Horizontal Situation Indicator  

The HSI is a direction indicator that uses the output from a fluxvalve todrive the compasscard.TheHSI [Figure16-30]combines the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a glideslope. The HSI gives the pilot an indication of the location of the aircraft in relation to the chosencourseorradial.  

In Figure 16-30, the aircraft magnetic heading displayed onthecompasscardunderthelubberlineis  $184^{\circ}$  .The course select pointer shown is set to  $295^{\circ}$  ；thetailofthe pointer indicates the reciprocal,  $115^{\circ}$  .Thecoursedeviation bar operates with a VOR/Localizer（VOR/LOC）orGPS navigation receiver toindicateleft or right deviations from the course selected with the course select pointer;operating in the same manner, the angular movement of a conventional VOR/LOC needle indicates deviation from course.  

The desired course is selected by rotating the course select pointer, in relation to the compass card, by means of the

courseselectknob.TheHSIhasafixedaircraftsymbol and the course deviation bar displays the aircraft'sposition relative to the selected course.TheTO/FROM indicator is a triangular pointer. When the indicator points to the head of the course select pointer,the arrow shows the course selected.If properly intercepted and flown, the course takes the aircraft to the chosen facility. When the indicator points to the tail of thecourse,the arrow shows that the course selected,if properly intercepted and flown, takes the aircraft directly away from the chosen facility.  

When the NAV warning flag appears, it indicates no reliable signal isbeing received.The appearance of theHDG flag indicates the compass card is not functioning properly.  

# Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI)  

TheRMI is a navigational aid providing aircraft magnetic or directional gyro heading and very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR), GPS, and automatic direction  

![](images/e7cae17c8f6f936398c61b5f7bc3eb1988efb1812f4e5c1e931b1f81fd6207ae.jpg)

finder(ADF)bearing information.[Figure16-31]Remote indicating compasses were developed to compensate fon errorsin and limitations of older types of heading indicators. The remote compass transmitter is a separate unit usually mounted in a wingtip to eliminate the possibility of magnetic interference. The RMI consists of a compass card, a heading index, two bearing pointers, and pointer function switches. The two pointers are driven by any two combinations of a GPS,anADF,and/oraVOR.Thepilot has the ability toselect the navigation aid to be indicated. The pointer indicates the course to the selected NAVA ID or waypoint.InFigure16-31, the green pointer is indicating the station tuned on the ADF. The yellow pointer is indicating the course to a VOR or GPS waypoint. Note that there is no requirement for a pilot to select a course with the RMI. Only the selected navigation sourceispointed toby theneedle(s).  

# TrackingWithVOR  

The following describes a step-by-step procedure for tracking toandfrom aVORstation usingaCDI.Figure16-32 illustrates the procedure.  

First,tune theVOR receiver to thefrequency of the selected VORstation.Forexample,115.0 to receive Bravo VOR. Next,check the identifiers toverify that thedesiredVOR is beingreceived.As soon as theVOR isproperlytuned, thecoursedeviationneedledeflectseitherleftorright. Then,rotate the azimuth dial to the courses elector until the coursedeviationneedlecentersandtheTO-FROMindicator indicates“TO."If the needle centers witha“FROM" indication,the azimuth should be rotated  $180^{\circ}$  because,in this case,itis desired tofly"TO"the station.Now,turn the aircrafttotheheadingindicatedontheVORazimuthdialor courseselector,  $350^{\circ}$  inthis example  

![](images/3c4863329dffa6efbee0e9624057c03aa9f1003da133272a21030d643dfc886e.jpg)  
Figure16-32.Tracking a radial in across wind.  

Ifaheadingof  $350^{\circ}$  is maintained with a wind from the right asshown,theaircraftdriftstotheleftoftheintendedtrack As the aircraft drifts off course, the VOR course deviation needle gradually moves to the right of center or indicates the direction of the desired radial or track.  

To return to the desired radial, the aircraft heading must be altered to the right.As the aircraft returns to the desired track, the deviation needle slowly returns to center. When centered, the aircraft is on the desired radial and aleftturnmustbe made toward, but not to the original heading of  $350^{\circ}$  because a wind drift correction must be established.The amount of correction depends upon the strength of the wind. If the wind velocity isunknown,a trial-and-error method canbe used to find the correct heading. Assume, for this example, a  $10^{\circ}$  correction for a heading of  $360^{\circ}$  ismaintained.  

While maintaining aheading of  $360^{\circ}$  ,assume that the course deviation begins to move to the left.This means that the wind correctionof  $10^{\circ}$  is too great and the aircraft is flying to the rightofcourse.As light turn to the left should be made to permit the aircraft to return to the desired radial  

When the deviation needle centers,a small wind drift correctionof  $5^{\circ}$  or a heading correction of  $355^{\circ}$  shouldbe flown. If this correction is adequate, the aircraft remains on the radial. If not, small variations in heading should be made to keep the needle centered and consequently keep the aircraftontheradial.  

AstheVORstationispassed,thecoursedeviationneedle fluctuates,then settles down,and the “TO" indication changesto“FROM."If the aircraftpasses toone sideofthe station,the needle deflects in the direction of the station as the indicator changes to"FROM.'  

Generally,the same techniques apply when tracking outbound as those used for tracking inbound.Iftheintentis to flyover the station and track outbound on the reciprocal of the inbound radial,the courses elector should notbechanged. Corrections are made in the same manner to keep the needle centered.The only difference is that the omni directional rangeindicatorindicates“FROM."  

If tracking outbound on a course other than the reciprocal of the inbound radial,this new course or radial must be set in the courses elector and a turn made to intercept this course. Afterthis courseisreached,tracking procedures arethesame as previously discussed.  

# Tips on Using the VOR  

Positively identify the station by its code or voice identification. Remember that VOR signals are“line-of-sight."A weaksignal or nosignal at allis receivedif the aircraft is too low or too far from the station. When navigating to a station, determine the inbound radial and use this radial.Fly a heading that will  

maintain the course. If the aircraft drifts, fly a heading tore-intercept the course then apply a correction to  

If minor needle fluctuations occur, avoid changing headings immediately.Wait a moment to see if the needle recenters; ifit does not, then you must correctly recenter the course to the needle When flying"TO"a station, always fly the selected course with a“TO"indication. When flying"FROM"a station,alwaysfly the selected course with a"FROM" indication.Ifthisisnotdone,the action of the course deviation needle is reversed. To further explain this reverseaction,if the aircraft is flown toward a station with a“FROM" indication or away from a station witha“TO"indication,thecoursedeviationneedle indicatesin a direction opposite to that which it should indicate.Forexample,if the aircraft driftstotheright of a radial being flown, the needle moves to the right or points awayfrom theradial.If the aircraftdrifts to the left of the radial being flown, the needle moves left or in the direction opposite of the radial. When navigating using the VOR, it is important to fly headings that maintain or re-intercept the course. Just turning toward the needle will cause overshooting theradial and flying an S turn to the left andrightof course.  

# Time and Distance Check From a Station Using a RMI  

To compute time and distance from a station,firstturnthe aircraft to place theRMI bearingpointer on thenearest  $90^{\circ}$  index. Note the time and maintain the heading. When the RMI bearing pointer has moved  $10^{\circ}$  ,notetheelapsedtime in seconds and apply the formulas in the following example todetermine the approximatetime and distancefrom agiven station.[Figure16-33]  

The time from station may also be calculated by using a short method based on the above formula, if a  $10^{\circ}$  bearing change is flown. If the elapsed time for the bearing change is noted  

![](images/524c73cb1f19c91e5ff78ac0f0ed6b8a1e871410f7a9614fc7914b3c8b195ae1.jpg)  
Figure16-33.Time-distance check example  

insecondsand a  $10^{\circ}$  bearing change is made, the time from the station, in minutes, is determined by counting off one decimal point. Thus, if 75 seconds are required to fly a  $10^{\circ}$  bearing change, the aircraft is 7.5 minutes from the station. When the RMI bearing pointer is moving rapidly or when several corrections arerequired to place the pointer on the wingtip position, the aircraft is at station passage.  

The distance from the station is computed by multiplying TAS or GS(in miles per minute)by the previously determined time inminutes.Forexample,if theaircraftis7.5minutesfrom station, flying at a TAS of 120 knots or 2 NM per minute, the distance from station is  $15~\mathrm{{NM}}$   $7.5\times2=15$  

The accuracy of time and distance checks is governed by existingwind,degree of bearing change,andaccuracyof timing.The number of variables involved causes the result to be only an approximation.However,by flying an accurate heading and checking the time and bearing closely,thepilot can make a reasonable estimate of time and distance from thestation.  

# Time and Distance Check From a Station Using a CDI  

To compute time and distance from a station using a CDI, firsttuneandidentifytheVORstationanddeterminethe radial on which you are located.Then turn inbound and re-center the needle if necessary. Turn  $90^{\circ}$  left or right, of the inbound course, rotating the OBS to the nearest  $10^{\circ}$  increment opposite the direction of turn. Maintain heading and when the CDI centers,notethetime.Maintaining the sameheading,rotatetheOBS  $10^{\circ}$  in the same direction as was done previously and note the elapsed time when the CDI again centers. Time and distance from the station is determined from the formula shown in Figure 16-34.  

# Course Intercept  

Course interceptions are performed in most phases of instrument navigation. The equipment used varies, but an intercept heading must be flown that results in an angle or rate of intercept sufficient for solving a particular problem.  

![](images/ecb96619eeb57b9fcc56f90e0d73027e9dbb527dbf0ba6684a0c57352f734c3a.jpg)  
Figure16-34.Time-distancecheckformulausingaCDI  

# Rate ofIntercept  

Rate of intercept, seen by the aviator as bearing pointer or HSI movement,is a result of the following factors:  

The angle atwhich the aircraft is flowntoward a desired course (angle ofintercept) True airspeed andwind(GS) Distance from the station  

# Angle of Intercept  

The angle of intercept is the angle between the heading of the aircraft (intercept heading) and the desired course. Controlling this angle by selection/adjustment of the intercept heading is the easiest and most effective way to control course interceptions.Angle of intercept must be greater than thedegreesfromcourse,butshouldnotexceed  $90^{\circ}$  .Within thislimit,make adjustments as needed,to achieve the most desirable rate of intercept  

When selecting an intercept heading, the key factor is the relationship between distance from thestation anddegrees from the course.Each degree,or radial,is  $1\ \mathrm{NM}$  wideat a distance of  $60~\mathrm{{NM}}$  from the station.Widthincreases or decreases in proportion to the  $60\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  distance. For example, 1 degree is 2 NM wide at  $120\;\mathrm{{NM}}.$  -and  $\%$  NMwideat30 NM. For a given GS and angle of intercept, the resultant rate of intercept varies according to the distance from the station. When selecting an intercept heading to form an angle of intercept, consider the following factors:  

Degreesfrom course Distance from the station True airspeed and wind (GS)  

# Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)  

Distance measuring equipment (DME) consists of an ultra highfrequency(UHF)navigational aid with VOR/DMEsand VORTACs.It measures,in NM,the slant range distance of an aircraft from a VOR/DMEorVORTAC(bothhereafter referred toasaVORTAC).Although D ME equipment is verypopular,not all aircraft a reD ME equipped.  

To utilize DME, the pilot should select, tune, and identify a VORTAC, as previously described. The DME receiver, utilizing what is called a “paired frequency” concept, automatically selects and tunes the UHF DME frequency associatedwith the VHF V ORTAC frequency selected by thepilot.This process is entirely transparent to the pilot. After a brief pause, the DME display shows the slant range distancetoorfromtheVORTAC.Slantrangedistanceisthe direct distancebetween the aircraft and theVORTAC and is therefore affected by aircraft altitude.(Station passage directly overaVORTACfrom an altitudeof6,076feetAGL would show approximately  $1.0\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  ontheDME.)DMEis a very useful adjunct toVORnavigation.AVOR radial alone merelygives line of position information.WithDME,a pilot mayprecisely locate the aircraft on a given line (radial)  

Most D ME receivers also provide GS and time-to-station modes of operation. The GS is displayed in knots (NMPH). Thetime-to-station mode displays the minutes remaining to VORTAC station passage, predicated upon the present GS. GSandtime-to-station information is only accurate when tracking directly to or from aVORTAC.DME receivers typically need a minute or two of stabilized flight directly to or from a VORTAC before displaying accurate GS or time-to-station information.  

Some D ME installations have aholdfeature thatpermits a D ME signal to be retained from one V ORTAC while the courseindicator displays course deviation information from anILS or anotherVORTAC.  

# VOR/DMERNAV  

Area navigation (RNAV)permits electronic course guidance on any direct route between points established by the pilot While RNAV is a generic term that applies to a variety ofNAVAIDS,such as GPS and others,this section deals withVOR/DME-basedRNAV.VOR/DMERNAVisnot a separateground-based NAVAID, but a method of navigation usingVOR/DME and V ORTAC signals specially processed by the aircraft'sRNAVcomputer.[Figure16-35]  

NOTE: In this section, the term "VORTAC" also includes VOR/DMENAVAIDs.  

In its simplest form,VOR/DME RNAV allows the pilot to electronically move V ORTAC s around tomore convenient locations.Once electronically relocated,theyarereferred to as waypoints. These waypoints are described as a combination of a selected radial and distance within the servicevolumeof the V ORTAC to be used.Thesewaypoints allowa straight course to be flown between almost any origin and destination,without regard to the orientation of V ORTAC s or the existence of airways  

![](images/caf0658bb96345cc771e1ac1136bbd5d27b841a9cf61a1a8aff31ccacd701997.jpg)  
Figure16-35.Flying an RNAV course.  

While the capabilities and methods of operation ofVOR/ DME RNAV units differ, there are basic principles of operation that are common to all.Pilots are urged to study the manufacturer's operating guide and receive instruction prior totheuse ofVOR/DMERNAVor anyunfamiliar navigational system.Operational information and limitations should also be sought from placards and the supplement sectionoftheAFM/POH.  

VOR/DME-basedRNAVunitsoperateinatleastthree modes:VOR,enroute,and approach.Afourthmode,VOR Parallel,may also be found on some models.Theunitsneed both VOR and D ME signals to operate in anyRNAVmode. If the NAV AIDs elected i saVOR without D ME,RNAV mode will not function.  

In the VOR (or non-RNAV) mode, the unit simply functions as aVORreceiver withDME capability.[Figure16-36]The unit's display on the VOR indicator is conventional in all respects. For operation on established airways or any other ordinary VOR navigation,theVORmodeis used.  

Toutilizetheunit'sRNAVcapability,thepilotselectsand establishes awaypoint or a series of waypoints todefine a course.AVORTAC(orVOR/DME)needs to be selected as a NAVAID, since both radial and distance signals are available from these stations. To establish a waypoint, a point somewhere within the service range of aV ORTAC is defined on the basis of radial anddistance.Oncethewaypoint isenteredintotheunitandtheRNAVenroutemodeis selected, the CDI displays course guidance to the waypoint, not the original VORTAC. DME also displays distance to thewaypoint.Many units have the capability to store several waypoints, allowing them to be programmed prior to flight if desired, and called up in flight.  

RNAVwaypoints areentered into the unit in magnet io bearings (radials) of degrees and tenths (i.e.,  $275.5^{\circ}$  and distances in NM and tenths (i.e.,  $25.2\;\mathrm{NM}$  .Whenplotting RNAVwaypoints on an aeronautical chart,pilotsfind it

Figure16-36.RNAVcontrols.  

difficult to measure to that level of accuracy,andinpractical application,it is rarely necessary. A number of flight planning publications publish airport coordinates and way points with this precision and the unit accepts those figures.There is a subtlebut important differencein CDI operation and display intheRNAVmodes.  

In the RNAV modes, course deviation is displayed in terms of linear deviation.In the RNAV en route mode, maximum deflection of the CDI typically represents 5 NM on either side of the selected course without regard to distance from the waypoint.In the RNA V approach mode,maximum deflection of the CDI typically represents  $1\%$  NM on either side of the selectedcourse.There is no increase in CDI sensitivity as the aircraft approaches away point in RNA V mode.  

The RNAV approach mode is used forinstrument approaches. Its narrow scale width (  $\%$  of the en route mode) permits very precise tracking to or from the selected waypoint. In VFR cross-country navigation, tracking a course in the approach mode is not desirable because it requires a great deal of attention and soon becomes tedious.  

A fourth,lesser-used mode on some units is the VOR Parallelmode.This permits the CDI to display linear (notangular)deviation as the aircraft tracks to and from VORTACs.It derives its name from permitting the pilot to offset (or parallel) a selected course or airway at a fixed distance of thepilot's choosing,if desired.TheVORparallel mode has the same effect as placing a waypoint directly over an existing V ORTAC.Some pilotsselect theVOR parallel mode when utilizing the navigation (NAV) tracking function of their autopilot for smoother coursefollowing neartheVORTAC  

Navigating an aircraftwithVOR/DME-based RNAVcanbe confusing, and it is essential that the pilot become familiar with the equipment installed. It is not unknown for pilots to operate inadvertently in one of the RNA V modes when the operationwas notintended,by overlooking switch positions or annunciators.The reverse has also occurred with a pilot neglecting to place theunit into one of theRNAVmodes by overlooking switch positions or ann uncia tors.Asalways,the prudent pilot is not onlyfamiliar with the equipment used, but never places complete reliance in just one method of navigationwhen others are availablefor cross-check  

# Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)  

Manygeneral aviation-type aircraft are equipped with ADF radio receiving equipment. To navigate using the ADF, thepilot tunes the receiving equipment to a ground station known as a nondirectional radiobeacon(NDB).The NDB stations normally operate in a low or medium frequency band of200to  $415\:\mathrm{kHz}$  .Thefrequencies arereadily available on aeronautical charts or in the Chart Supplement U.S  

All radiobeacons,except compass locators,transmit a continuous three-letter identification in code,except during voice transmissions.Acompasslocator,whichis associated with an instrument landing system, transmits a two-letter identification.  

Standard broadcast stations can also be used in conjunction withADF.Positive identification of all radio stations is extremely important and this is particularly true when using standard broadcast stations for navigation.  

N DBs have one advantage over the VOR in that low or medium frequencies are not affected by line-of-sight.The signals follow the curvature of the Earth;therefore,ifthe aircraft is within the range of the station,thesignalscanbe received regardless of altitude  

The following table gives the class of NDB stations, thein power, and their usable range:  

![NONDIRECTIONALRADIOBEACON(NDB) (Usable radius distances for all altitudes) ](images/2ef9c7a3a5222c6aef805093cc1e8fa5c3b48d3d3c04495ae6bc16734902899c.jpg)  
\*Service range of individual facilities may be less than 50miles.  

One of the disadvantages that should be considered when using low frequency (LF)for navigationis that LFsignals are very susceptible to electrical disturbances, such as lightning. These disturbances create excessive static,needle deviations, andsignalfades.There maybe interference from distant stations.Pilots should know the conditions under which these disturbancescan occur so they can be more alerttopossible interference when using the ADF.  

Basically, the ADF aircraft equipment consists of a tuner, which is used to set the desired station frequency, and the navigational display.  

The navigational display consists of a dial upon which the azimuth isprintedand a needle which rotates around the dial and points to the station to which the receiver is tuned.  

Some of the ADF dials can be rotated toalign the azimuth with the aircraft heading; others are fixed with  $0^{\circ}$  representing the nose of the aircraftand  $180^{\circ}$  representing the tail.Only the fixed azimuth dial is discussed in this handbook.[Figure16-37]  

Figure16-38 illustrates terms that are used with the ADF and should be understood by thepilot.  

To determine the magnetic bearing “FROM" the station,  $180^{\circ}$  is added to or subtracted from the magnetic bearing to the station. This is the reciprocal bearing and is used when plotting position fixes.  

![](images/367e0f905b62e1fbd57a2e69a809ff3cdf1e461008837ac2f2ffc9c179909fc3.jpg)  
Figure16-37.ADF with fixed azimuth and magnetic compass.

Figure16-38.ADFterms.  

Keep in mind that the needle of fixed azimuth points to the station in relation to the nose of the aircraft.Iftheneedle is deflected  $30^{\circ}$  to the left for a relative bearing of  $330^{\circ}$  this means that the station is located  $30^{\circ}$  left. If the aircraft is turned left  $30^{\circ}$  ,the needle moves to the right  $30^{\circ}$  and indicates a relative bearing of  $0^{\circ}$  meaning that the aircraft is pointing toward the station.If the pilot continues flight toward the station keeping the needle on  $0^{\circ}$  ,theprocedure is called homing to the station.If across wind exists,the ADF needle continues to drift awayfrom zero.Tokeep the needle on zero, the aircraft must be turned slightly resulting in a curved flight path to the station.Homing tothestation is a common procedure but may result in drifting downwind, thus lengthening the distance to thestation.  

Tracking to the stationrequires correctingfor wind drift and results in maintaining flight along a straight track or bearing tothestation.When the wind drift correction is established, the ADF needle indicates the amount of correction to the rightorleft.Forinstance,if the magnetic bearing to the stationis  $340^{\circ}$  ,，a correction for a left cross wind would result in a magnetic heading of  $330^{\circ}$  ，andtheADFneedle wouldindicate  $10^{\circ}$  totherightor a relative bearing of  $010^{\circ}$  [Figure16-39]  

When tracking away from the station,wind corrections are made similar to tracking to the station,buttheADFneedle points toward thetailof theaircraftor the  $180^{\circ}$  positionon the azimuth dial. Attempting to keep the ADF needle on the  $180^{\circ}$  position during winds results in the aircraft flying a curved flight leading further and further from the desired track.When tracking outbound,correctionsfor wind should be made in the direction opposite of that in which the needle is pointing.  

Although the ADF is not aspopular as theVORforradic navigation, with proper precautions and intelligent use, the ADFcanbeavaluableaidtonavigation  

# Global Positioning System  

The GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system. Its RNA V guidance is worldwide in scope.Thereareno symbols for GPS on aeronautical charts as it is a space-based system with global coverage. Development of the system is underway so that GPS is capable of providing the primary means of electronic navigation.Portable and yoke-mounted units are proving tobe verypopular in addition to those permanently installed in the aircraft.Extensive navigation databases are common features in aircraft GPS receivers.

Figure16-39.ADFtracking  

TheGPSis a satellite radio navigation and time dissemination system developed and operated by the U.s.Departmentof Defense(DOD).Civilian interface and GPS system status is available from the U.S. Coast Guard.  

It is not necessary to understand the technical aspects of GPS operation to use it in VFR/IFRnavigation.It doesdiffer significantly from conventional,ground-based electronic navigation and awareness of those differences isimportant. Awareness of equipment approvals and limitations is critical to the safety of flight.  

The GPS navigation system broadcasts a signal that isused by receivers to determine precise position anywhere in the world.Thereceiver tracks multiple satellites and determines a pseudo range measurement to determine theuserlocation. A minimum of four satellites is necessary toestablish an accurate three-dimensional position.TheDepartment of Defense(DOD)is responsible for operating theGPSsatellite constellation and monitors the GPS satellites to ensure proper operation.  

ThestatusofaGPSsatelliteisbroadcastaspartofthedata messagetransmittedbythesatellite.GPSstatusinformation is also available from theU.S.CoastGuard navigation information service at（703)313-5907 or online at www. navcen.uscg.gov.Additionally,satellite status is available through the NOT AM system.  

The GPS receiver verifies the integrity(usability）of the signals received from the GPS constellation through receiver autonomous integrity monitoring(RAIM)to determine if a satellite is providing corrupted information.Atleast one satellite, in addition to those required for navigation, must be inviewfor the receiver to perform theRAIM function; thus,R AIM needs a minimum of five satellites in view or four satellites and a barometric altimeter (baro-aiding) to detect an integrity anomaly. For receivers capable of doing so,R AIM needs six satellites in view(or five satellites with baro-aiding)to isolate the corrupt satellite signal and remove it from the navigation solution. Baro-aiding is a method of augmenting the GPS integrity solution by using an on satellite input source. GPS derived altitude should not be relied upon todetermineaircraftaltitudesincetheverticalerrorcan be quite large and no integrity is provided. To ensure that baro-aiding is available,the current altimeter setting must be enteredintothereceiverasdescribedintheoperatingmanual.  

RAl M messages vary somewhat between receivers;however, generally there are two types.Onetype indicates that there are not enough satellites available to provideR AIM integrity monitoring and another type indicates that the RAIM integrity monitor has detected a potential error that exceeds the limit for the current phase of flight.Without RAIM capability,the pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position  

# Selective Availability  

Selective Availability(SA)is a method by which the accuracy of GPS is intentionally degraded.This feature is designed to deny hostile use of precise GPS positioning data.SA was discontinued on May 1, 2000, but many GPS receivers are designed to assume that SAis still active.  

The baseline GPS satellite constellation consists of 24 satellitespositionedinsixearth-centeredorbitalplanes with four operation satellites and a spare satellites lot in each orbital plane. The system can support a constellation ofuptothirtysatellitesinorbit.TheorbitalperiodofaGPS satelliteisone-half of a sidereal day or 11 hours 58 minutes. The orbits are nearly circular and equally spaced about the equator at a 60-degree separationwith an inclination of 55 degrees relative to the equator. The orbital radius (i.e distancefrom the center of mass of the earth to the satellite) is approximately  $26{,}600\,\mathrm{km}$  

With the baseline satellite constellation,userswithaclear view of the sky have a minimum of four satellites in view. It is more likely that a user would see six to eight satellites. The satellites broadcast ranging signals and navigation data allowing users tomeasure their pseudoranges in order to estimate theirposition,velocity and time,in a passive,listen- onlymode.The receiver uses data from aminimumoffour satellites above the mask angle(thelowest angle above the horizon at which a receiver can use a satellite).Theexact number of satellites operating at anyone particular time variesdependingonthenumberofsatelliteoutagesand operational spares in orbit.For current status of the GPS constellation, please visit http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpscurr html.[Figure16-40]  

# VFRUseofGPS  

GPS navigation has become a great asset to VFR pilots providing increased navigation capability and enhanced situational awareness while reducing operating costs due to greater ease in flying direct routes. While GPS has many benefits to theVFRpilot,care must be exercised toensure that system capabilities are not exceeded.  

Types of receivers usedfor GPS navigation underVFR are varied from a full IFR installation being used to support a VFR flight to a VFR only installation(in either a VFR or IFR capable aircraft)to a hand-held receiver.Thelimitations of  

![](images/5d19a59fc1ab874890f2a74b906c7ddfb41055909e3bbdb53f8e23bc1664829f.jpg)  
Figure16-40.Satellite constellation  

each type of receiver installation or use must be understood by the pilot to avoid misusing navigation information. In all cases,VFR pilots should never rely solely on one system ofnavigation.GPS navigation must be integrated with other forms of electronic navigation,as well aspilotage and dead reckoning. Only through the integration of these techniques can the VFR pilot ensure accuracy in navigation Some critical concerns in VFR use of GPS include R AIM capability, database currency, and antenna location.  

# RAIM Capability  

Many VFR GPS receivers and all hand-heldunitsarenot equipped with RAIM alerting capability. Loss of the required number of satellites in view,or the detection of a position error,cannot be displayed to the pilot by such receivers. In receivers with no RAIM capability, no alert would be provided to the pilot that the navigation solution had deteriorated and an undetected navigation error could occur. A systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques would identify thisfailure andprevent aserious deviation.  

In many receivers,an updatable database is used for navigation fixes,airports,and instrument procedures. These databases must be maintained to the current update forIFR operation,but no such requirement exists for VFR use. However,in many cases, the database drives a moving map display that indicates Special UseAirspace and the various classes of airspace in addition to other operational information.Without a current database,themoving map display may be outdated and offer erroneous information to VFR pilots wishing to fly aroundcritical airspace areas. such as a Restricted Area or a Class B airspace segment. Numerous pilots have ventured into airspace theyweretrying to avoid by using an outdated database.If there is not a current database in the receiver, disregard the moving map display whenmaking critical navigation decisions.  

In addition, waypoints are added, removed, relocated, or re- named as required to meet operational needs.Whenusing GPS to navigate relative to a named fix,a current database must be used to properly locate a named waypoint.Without theupdate,itisthepilot's responsibility to verify the waypoint location referencing to an official current source, such as the Chart Supplement U.S.,sectionalchart,oren routechart.  

In manyVFR installations of GPS receivers,antennalocation is more a matter of convenience than performance. In IFR installations, care is exercised to ensure that an adequate clear view is provided for the antenna to communicate with satellites. If an alternate location is used, some portion of the aircraft mayblock theview of the antenna increasing the possibility of losing navigation signal.  

This is especially true in the case of hand-held receivers.The use of hand-held receivers forVFR operations is a growing trend, especially among rental pilots. Typically, suction cups areused toplace theGPS antennas on the insideof aircraft windows.While this method has great utility,theantenna location is limited by aircraft structurefor optimal reception of available satellites. Consequently, signal loss may occur in certain situations where aircraft-satellite geometry causes a loss of navigation signal. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot  

While the use of hand-held GPS receivers for VFR operations is not limited by regulation,modification of the aircraft,such as installing a panel-oryoke-mountedholder,isgovernedby 14CFRpart43.Pilotsshouldconsultamechanictoensure compliance with the regulation and a safe installation.  

# Tipsfor UsingGPSforVFROperations  

Always check tosee if theunit hasRAIM capability.If no RAIM capability exists,be suspicious of a GPS displayed positionwhen any disagreement exists with theposition derived from other radionavigation systems,pilotage, or deadreckoning.  

Check the currency of the database, if any. If expired, update the database using the current revision. If an update of an expired database is not possible, disregard any moving map display of airspace for critical navigation decisions.Be aware that named waypoints may no longer exist or may have been relocated since the database expired.At a minimum, the waypoints tobeused should be verified against a current official source, such as the Chart Supplement U.S. or a Sectional Aeronautical Chart.  

While ahand-held GPSreceiver canprovide excellent navigation capability to VFR pilots,bepreparedfor intermittent loss of navigation signal,possibly with noR AIM warning to the pilot.If mounting the receiver in the aircraft. besure tocomply with14 CFR part 43  

Plan flights carefully before taking off. If navigating to user defined waypoints, enter them prior to flight, not on the fly. Verify the planned flight against a current source, such as a current sectional chart. There have been cases in which one pilot used way points created by another pilot that were not where the pilot flying was expecting. This generally resulted in a navigation error. Minimize head-down time in the aircraft and maintain a sharp lookout for traffic, terrain, and obstacles. Just a few minutes of preparation and planning on the ground makes a great difference in the air.  

Another way to minimize head-down time is to become very familiar with the receiver's operation.Most receivers are not intuitive.The pilot must take the time to learn the various keystrokes, knob functions, and displays that are used in the operation of the receiver.Some manufacturers provide computer-based tutorials or simulations of their receivers. Take the time to learn about the particular unit before using itinflight.  

Insummary,be careful not to rely on GPS to solve all VFR navigational problems. Unless an IFR receiver is installed in accordance with IFR requirements, no standard of accuracy or integrity can be assured.While the practicality of GPSis compelling,the fact remains that only the pilot can navigate the aircraft,andGPSisjustoneofthepilot'stoolstodothejob  

# VFR Waypoints  

VFR way points provide VFR pilots with a supplementary tool to assist with position awareness while navigating visually in aircraft equipped with area navigation receivers. VFR way points should be used as a tool to supplement current navigation procedures.Theuse of VFR way points include providing navigational aids for pilots unfamiliar with an area, waypoint definition of existing reporting points, enhanced navigation in and around Class B and Class C airspace, and enhanced navigation around Special Use Airspace.VFR pilots should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical charts published specifically for visual navigation.If operatingin aterminal area,pilotsshould takeadvantage of the Terminal Area Chart availablefor the area, if published. The use of VFR waypoints does not relieve the pilot of any responsibility to comply with the operational requirements of14CFRpart91.  

VFR waypoint names (for computer entry and flight plans) consist of five letters beginning with the letters"VP"and are retrievable from navigation databases.TheVFRwaypoint names arenotintended to be pronounceable,and they arenot for use in ATC communications.OnVFRcharts,astand- alone VFR waypoint is portrayed using the same four-point starsymbol used forIFR waypoints.VFR waypoint collocated with a visual checkpoint on the chart is identified by a small magenta flag symbol.A VFR waypoint collocated with a visual checkpointis pronounceable based on the name of the visual checkpoint and maybeusedfor ATC communications. EachVFR waypoint name appears in parentheses adjacent to the geographic location on the chart.Latitude/longitude data for all established VFR waypoints may be found in the appropriate regional Chart Supplement U.S.  

When filingVFR flight plans,use the five-letter identifier as a waypointin the route of flight section if thereis anintended course change at that point or if used to describe the planned routeofflight.This VFR filing would be similar to VOR use in a route of flight.Pilots must use theVFRwaypoints only when operating under VFR conditions.  

AnyVFR waypoints intended for use during a flight shoulo be loaded into the receiver while on the ground andpriorto departure.Onceairborne,pilotsshould avoid programming routes or VFR waypoint chains into their receivers.  

Pilots should be especially vigilant for other traffic while operating near VFR waypoints. The same effort to see and avoidother aircraft near VFR way points is necessary,as is the case when operating near VORs and NDBs. In fact, theincreased accuracy of navigation through theuse of GPS demands even greater vigilance as there are fewer off-course deviations among different pilots and receivers. When operating near a VFR waypoint, use all available ATC services,even if outside a class of airspace where communications are required. Regardless of the class of airspace,monitor the available ATC frequency closely for information on other aircraft operating in the vicinity. It is also a good idea to turn on landing light(s)whenoperating near a VFR waypoint to make the aircraft more conspicuous to other pilots, especially when visibility is reduced.  

# Lost Procedures  

Getting lost in flight is a potentially dangerous situation, especially when low on fuel.If a pilot becomes lost,there are some good commonsense procedures to follow.Ifatown or city cannot be seen, the first thing to do is climb, being mindful of traffic and weather conditions.Anincreasein altitude increases radio and navigation reception range and also increases radar coverage.Ifflyingnear atownorcity,it maybe possible to read the name of the town on a water tower.  

If the aircraft has a navigational radio, such as a VOR or ADF receiver, it can be possible to determine positionby plotting an azimuth from two or more navigational facilities.If GPS is installed,or a pilot has a portable aviation GPS onboard, itcanbeusedtodeterminetheposition andthelocationof the nearest airport.  

Communicatewith any available facility using frequencies shown on the sectional chart.If contact is made with a controller, radar vectors may be offered. Other facilities may offer direction finding(DF)assistance.To use this procedure, thecontrollerrequeststhepilottoholddownthetransmit buttonforafewsecondsandthenreleaseit.Thecontroller may ask the pilot to change directions a few times and repeat the transmit procedure. This gives the controller enough information toplot the aircraft position and then givevectors to a suitable landing site. If the situation becomes threatening, transmit the situation on the emergency frequency  $121.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$  and set the transponder to 770o.Most facilities,and even airliners, monitor the emergency frequency.  

# Flight Diversion  

Theremaycomeatimewhen apilotisnot abletomakeit to the planned destination. This can be the result of unpredicted weather conditions, a system malfunction, or poor preflight planning. In any case, the pilot needs to be able to safely and efficiently divert toan alternate destination.Risk management procedures become a priority during any type of flight diversion and should be used the pilot. For example. the hazards of inadvertent VFR into I MC involve a risk that thepilot canidentify and assess and then mitigate through a pre-planned or in-flight diversion around hazardous weather. Before anycross-countryflight,check the charts for airports or suitable landing areas along or near the route of flight. Also, check for navigational aids that can be used during a diversion. Risk management is explained in greater detail in Chapter 2,Aeronautical Decision-making.  

Computing course, time, speed, and distance information in flight requires the same computations used duringpreflight planning.However,becauseof the limited flight deck space and because attentionmust be divided between flying the aircraft,making calculations, and scanning for other aircraft take advantage of all possible shortcuts and rule-of-thumb computations.  

When in flight, it is rarely practical to actually plot a course on a sectional chart and mark checkpoints and distances. Furthermore,because an alternate airportis usually not very far from your original course, actual plotting is seldom necessary.  

The course to an alternate destination can be measured accurately with a protractor or plotter but can also be measured with reasonable accuracy using a straightedge and the compass rose depicted around VOR stations.This approximation can be made on the basis of a radial from a nearbyVOR or an airway that closely parallels the course to your alternate destination.However, remember that the magneticheading associated with aVOR radial or printed airway is outbound from the station.To find the course to thestation,it maybe necessary to determine the reciprocal of that heading. It is typically easier to navigate to an alternate airport that has a VOR or ND B facility on the field  

After selecting the most appropriate alternate destination, approximate the magnetic course to the alternate using a compass rose or airway on the sectional chart. If time permits, try to start the diversion over a prominent ground feature.  

However,in anemergency,divert promptly toward your alternate destination. Attempting to complete all plotting measuring,and computations involved before diverting to the alternate destination may only aggravate an actual emergency.  

Once established on course, note the time, and then use the winds aloft nearest to your diversion point to calculate a heading and GS. Once a GS has been calculated, determine a new arrival time and fuel consumption. Give priority to flying the aircraft while dividing attention between navigation and planning. When determining an altitude to use while diverting consider cloud heights, winds, terrain, and radio reception  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter has discussed the fundamentals of VFR navigation.Beginning with an introduction to the charts that can be used for navigation to the more technically advanced conceptof GPS,thereisone aspect of navigation that remains the samethe pilot is responsible for proper planning and the execution of that planning to ensure asafeflight.  

# Chapter 17 Aeromedica actors

It isimportant for a pilot to be awareof the mentaland physical standards required for the type of flying performed. This chapter provides information on medical certification and on avariety of aeromedical factorsrelated toflight activities.

# Obtaining a Medical Certificate  

Most pilots must have a valid medical certificate to exercise the privileges of their airman certificates.Gliderandfree balloon pilots are not required to hold a medical certificate. Sport pilots may hold either a medical certificate or a valid state driver's license. Regardless of whether a medical certificate or drivers license is required,14CFR61.53 requires everypilot not toact as a crewmemberif theyknow, or have reason to know,of any medical condition that would make them unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner.  

Acquisition of a medical certificate requires an examination by an aviation medical examiner(AME),aphysician with training in aviation medicine designated by the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI).There are three classes of medical certificates.The class of certificate needed depends on the type of flying the pilot plans to perform.  

Athird-class medical certificate is required for a private or recreational pilot certificate.It is valid for 5 years for those individualswhohavenotreachedtheageof40;otherwiseit is valid for 2 years.A commercial pilot certificate requires at leastasecond-class medical certificate,which is valid for 1 year.First-class medical certificates are required for airline transport pilots and are valid for one year if the airman is 40 oryounger;40 and older it is valid for 6 months.  

The standards are more rigorous for the higher classes of certificates. A pilot with a higher class medical certificate hasmet the requirements for the lower classes aswell.Since the required medical classapplies only when exercising the privileges of the pilot certificate for which it is required, a first-class medical certificate would be valid for 1 year if exercising the privileges of a commercial certificate and 2 or 5 years, as appropriate,for exercising the privileges of a private or recreational certificate. The same applies for a second-class medical certificate. The standards for medical certification are contained in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 67 and the requirements for obtaining medical certificates can be found in 14 CFRpart 61.  

Students whohave physical limitations,such as impaired vision, loss of a limb, or hearing impairment may be issued a medical certificate valid for"student pilot privileges only" while learning to fly.Pilots with disabilities mayrequire special equipment to be installed in the aircraft, such as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia. Some disabilities necessitate a limitation on the individual'scertificate;for example,impairedhearing wouldrequire thelimitation "not valid for flight requiring the use of radio." When all the knowledge, experience, and proficiency requirements have beenmet anda student can demonstrate the ability to operate the aircraft with the normal level of safety,a“statementof demonstrated ability"(SODA)canbeissued.Thiswaiver, or SODA, is valid as long as the physical impairment does not worsen.Contact thelocal Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)for more information on thissubject.  

TheFAA medical standards,14CFRpart67,specifyfifteen medical conditions that are considered disqualifying by "history or clinical diagnosis." Regardless of when one of these conditions was diagnosed and treated, an airman may not be issued a medical certificate except through a process calleda“Special Issuance Authorization,asexplained in 14 CFR part 67, section 67.401. A special issuance is a discretionary issuance by theFAA Federal Air Surgeon and requires satisfactory completion of special testing determined by the FAA to demonstrate that an airman is safe to fly for the duration of the medical certificate issued.The specific disqualifying conditions include:  

Diabetes mellitus requiring oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin Angina pectoris Coronary heart disease that has been treated or,if untreated,that has been symptomatic or clinically significant Myocardial infarction Cardiac valve replacement 。 Permanentcardiacpacemaker Heart replacement Psychosis Bipolar disorder Personality disorder that is severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts Substance dependence(including alcohol) Substanceabuse Epilepsy Disturbance of consciousness and without satisfactory explanation ofcause Transientloss ofcontrol of nervoussystemfunction(s) without satisfactory explanation of cause  

However, thislist includes only the mandatory disqualifying conditions.There are many other medical conditions that fall into the General Medical Condition section of theregulations that are considered by the FAA to be disqualifying even though they are not stated in the regulations.Conditions such as cancer, kidney stones, neurologic and neuromuscular conditions including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis,certain blood disorders,and other conditions that may progress over time require review by the FAA before a medical certificate maybe issued.  

The important thing to remember is that with very few exceptions,all disqualifying medical conditions may be considered for special issuance.Ifyoucanpresent satisfactory medical documentation to the FAA that your conditionisstable,thechancesaregoodthatyouwillbe able to qualify for an Authorization.  

# Health and Physiological Factors Affecting Pilot Performance  

A number of healthfactors and physiological effects can be linked to flying. Some are minor, while others are important enough to require special attention to ensure safety of flight In some cases, physiological factors can lead to inflight emergencies.Some important medical factors that a pilot should be aware of include hypoxia, hyperventilation, middle ear and sinus problems, spatial disorientation, motion sickness, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, stress and fatigue, dehydration, and heatstroke. Other subjects include the effects of alcohol and drugs, anxiety, and excess nitrogen in the blood after scuba diving.  

# Hypoxia  

Hypoxia means"reduced oxygen"or"not enough oxygen. Although any tissue will die if deprived of oxygen long enough,the greatest concern regarding hypoxia during flight is lack of oxygen to the brain, since it is particularly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation. Any reduction in mental function while flying can result in life-threatening errors. Hypoxia can be caused by several factors,including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. Theforms of hypoxia are based on their causes:  

Hypoxic hypoxia Hypemic hypoxia Stagnant hypoxia Histotoxic hypoxia  

# Hypoxic Hypoxia  

Hypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen available to the body as a whole.A blocked airway and drowning are obvious examples of how thelungs canbe deprived of oxygen, but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude is an appropriate example for pilots. Although the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is constant, its partial pressure decreases proportionately as atmospheric pressure decreases.As an aircraft ascends during flight, the percentage ofeach gasin the atmosphere remains thesame,but there are fewer molecules available at the pressure required for them to pass between the membranes in the respiratory system This decrease in number of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressurecanlead tohypoxichypoxia.  

# Dangers of Transporting Dry Ice  

Sublimation is a process in which a substance transitions from a solid to a gaseous state without passing through an intermediate liquid state.Dry ice sublimates into large quantities of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  gas, which can rapidly displace oxygen- containing air and potentially cause hypoxia via carbon dioxide intoxication.Case studies have shown that both illness and death can because d by occupational and/orunintentional exposure when transporting dry ice in small,confined spaces such as a flight deck or airplane.Exposuretohigh concentrationof  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  gas may lead to increased respiration, tachycardia,cardiac arrhythmia, and unconsciousness. Exposure to concentration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  gas in excess of 10 percent maycauseconvulsions,coma,and/ordeath  

Thetendency of dryice to rapidly sublimate alsomeans that without proper ventilation, it can rapidly pressurize. For this reason, dry ice should never be placed inside a sealed transport container(i.e.,leak-proof secondary container) and must be placed within an outer shipping container or storage container that allows adequate ventilation to release the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  gas and avoid pressurization. Sealing dry ice within a leak-proof container may result in explosion of the container potentially leading to serious physical injury or death.  

# Hypemic Hypoxia  

Hype mic hypoxia occurs when the blood is notable to take upandtransportasufficientamountofoxygentothecells in the body. Hypemic means “not enough blood." This type of hypoxia is a result of oxygen deficiency in the blood, rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen,andcanbecaused by a variety of factors.It maybe due to reduced blood volume (from severe bleeding), or it may result from certain blood diseases, such as anemia.More often,hypemic hypoxia occurs because hemoglobin,the actual blood molecule that transports oxygen,is chemically unable to bind oxygen molecules. The most common form of hypemic hypoxia is CO poisoning. This is explained in greater detail later in this chapter. Hypemic hypoxia can also be caused by the loss of blood due to blood donation.Blood volume can require severalweeks toreturn to normal following a donation. Althoughtheeffectsofthebloodlossareslightatground level,there are risks when flying during this time.  

# Stagnant Hypoxia  

Stagnant means “not flowing,” and stagnant hypoxia or ischemia results when the oxygen-rich blood in the lungs is not moving, for one reason or another, to the tissues that need it. An arm or leg “going to sleep" because the blood flowhasaccidentallybeenshutoffisoneformofstagnant hypoxia.Thiskind of hypoxiacan alsoresultfrom shock, the heart failing to pump blood effectively, or a constricted artery. During flight, stagnant hypoxia can occur with excessive acceleration of gravity(Gs).Cold temperatures can also reduce circulation and decrease the blood supplied toextremities.  

# Histotoxic Hypoxia  

The inability of the cells to effectivelyuse oxygen is defined as his to toxic hypoxia.“Histo"referstotissues or cells,and "toxic”means poisonous. In this case, enough oxygen is being transported to the cells that need it, but they are unable to make use of it. This impairment of cellular respiration can be caused by alcohol and other drugs, such as narcotics and poisons. Research has shown that drinking one ounce of alcohol can equate to an additional 2,000feet of physiological altitude.  

# Symptoms of Hypoxia  

High-altitude flying can place a pilot in danger of becoming hypoxic.Oxygen starvation causes the brain and other vital organs to become impaired.The first symptoms of hypoxia can include euphoria and a carefree feeling. With increased oxygen starvation,the extremities become less responsive and flying becomes less coordinated.The symptoms of hypoxia vary with the individual,but common symptoms include:  

Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips) Headache Decreased response tostimuli andincreased reaction time Impaired judgment Euphoria Visual impairment Drowsiness Lightheaded or dizzy sensation Tingling in fingers and toes Numbness  

As hypoxia worsens,thefield of vision begins to narrow and instrument interpretation canbecome difficult.Evenwith all these symptoms, the effects of hypoxia can cause a pilot to have a falsesense ofsecurity and be deceived intobelieving everything is normal.  

# Treatment ofHypoxia  

Treatment for hypoxia includes flying at lower altitudes and/ or using supplemental oxygen.Allpilots are susceptible to the effects of oxygen starvation, regardless of physical endurance or acclimatization.When flying at high altitudes. it is paramount that oxygen be used to avoid the effects of hypoxia.The term“time of useful consciousness" describes the maximum time the pilot has to make rational, life-saving decisions and carry them out at a given altitude without supplemental oxygen.As altitude increases above 10,000 feet,the symptoms of hypoxia increase in severity,andthe time of useful consciousness rapidly decreases.[Figure 17-1] Since symptoms of hypoxia can be different for each individual,the ability to recognize hypoxia can be greatly improved by experiencing and witnessing the effects of it during an altitude chamber “flight." The Federal Aviation Administration(FAA)provides this opportunity through aviation physiology training,which is conducted at theFAA CAMI in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and at many military facilities across the United States.For information about the FAA's one-day physiological training course with altitude chamber and vertigo demonstrations,visit the FAA website atwww.faa.gov.  

# Hyperventilation  

Hyperventilation is the excessiverate and depthof respiratior leading to abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood. This condition occurs more often among pilots than is generally recognized.It seldom incapacitates completely, but it causes disturbing symptoms that can alarm the uninformed pilot. In such cases, increased breathing rate and anxiety further aggravate the problem.Hyperventilation can lead to unconsciousness due to the respiratory system'soverriding mechanism to regain control of breathing  

Pilots encountering an unexpected stressful situation may subconsciously increase their breathing rate.If flying at higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a pilot may have a tendency to breathe more rapidly than normal, which often leads to hyperventilation.  

Sincemanyof thesymptoms of hyperventilation aresimilar to those of hypoxia, it is important to correctly diagnose and treat the proper condition. If using supplemental oxygen, check theequipment and flowrate to ensure thesymptoms are  

![Figure17-1.Time of useful consciousness. ](images/a1cb93f878ea5ace43ceb76c5d068db77430381e2c2714642b8608a8e0943963.jpg)  

not hypoxia related.Common symptoms of hyperventilation include:  

Visual impairment Unconsciousness Lightheaded or dizzy sensation Tingling sensations Hot and cold sensations Musclespasms  

The treatment for hyperventilation involves restoring the proper carbon dioxide level in the body. Breathing normally is both the best prevention and the best cure for hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the breathing rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking aloud helps to overcome hyperventilation.Recovery is usually rapid once the breathing rate is returned to normal.  

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems  

During climbs and descents,the free gas formerly present in various body cavities expands due to a difference between the pressure of the air outside the body and that of the air inside thebody. If the escape of the expanded gas is impeded, pressure builds up within the cavity and pain is experienced. Trapped gas expansion accounts for earp a in andsinuspain as well as a temporary reduction in the ability to hear.  

Themiddleearisasmallcavitylocatedintheboneofthe skull.It is closed off from the externalear canal by the eardrum. Normally, pressure differences between the middle ear and the outside world are equalized by a tube leading from inside each ear to the back of the throat on each side called the Eus tachi an tube.These tubes are usually closed but open during chewing, yawning, or swallowing to equalize pressure. Even a slight difference between external pressure andmiddleearpressurecancausediscomfort.[FigureI7-2}  

During a climb,middle ear air pressure may exceed the pressure of the air in theexternal ear canalcausing the eardrum to bulge outward.Pilots become aware of this pressure change when they experience alternate sensations of “fullness” and “clearing." During descent, the reverse happens. While the pressure of the air in the external ear canal increases, the middle ear cavity, which equalized with the lower pressure at altitude, is at lower pressure than the external ear canal. This results in the higher outside pressure causingthe eardrum tobulgeinward.  

This condition can be more difficult to relieve due to the fact that the partial vacuum tends to constrict the walls of the Eus tachi an tube.To remedy this often painful condition, which also causes a temporary reduction in hearing

sensitivity, pinch the nostrils shut, close the mouth and lips. and blowslowly andgentlyinto themouth and nose.  

This procedure forces air through the Eustachian tube into the middleear.It may not be possible to equalize the pressure in the ears if a pilot has a cold, an ear infection, or sore throat. A flight in this condition can be extremely painful, as well as damaging to the eardrums. If experiencing minor congestion, nose drops or nasal sprays may reduce the risk of a painful ear blockage. Before using any medication, check with an AME toensure that it will not affect the ability tofly  

Ina similar way,air pressure in the sinuses equalizes with the pressure in the flight deck through small openings that connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. An upper respiratory infection,such as a coldor sinusitis,or a nasal allergic condition can produce enough congestion around an opening to slow equalization.As the difference in pressure between thesinuses and theflight deckincreases,congestion may plug the opening. This “sinus block" occurs most frequently during descent.Slow descent rates can reduce the associatedpain.Asinusblockcan occurin the frontal sinuses, located above each eyebrow, or in the maxillary sinuses, located in each upper cheek.It usually produces excruciating painover thesinus area.A maxillary sinus block can also make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus may discharge from the nasal passages.  

Sinus block can be avoided by not flying with an upper respiratory infection or nasal allergic condition.Adequate protection is usually not provided by decongestant sprays or drops to reduce congestion around the sinus openings. Oral decongestants have side effects that canimpairpilot performance.If a sinus block does not clear shortly after landing,a physician should be consulted.  

# Spatial Disorientation and llusions  

Spatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement of the airplaneinspace.The body uses three integrated systems that work together to ascertain orientation and movementinspace.  

Vestibular system—organs found in the inner ear that sense position by the way we are balanced Somatosensorysystem——nervesintheskin,muscles,and joints that, along with hearing, sense position based on gravity, feeling, and sound Visual system—eyes, which sense position based on whatisseen  

All this information comes together in the brain and, most of the time, the three streams of information agree, giving a clear idea of where and how the body is moving. Flying can sometimes cause these systems to supply conflicting information to the brain,which can lead to disorientation. During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), the eyes arethemajor orientation source and usually prevail over false sensations from other sensory systems.When these visual cues are removed,as they are in instrument meteorological conditions(IMC),false sensations can cause a pilot to quickly become disoriented.  

The vestibular system in the inner ear allows the pilot to sense movement and determine orientation in the surrounding environment. In both the left and right inner ear, three semicircular canals are positioned at approximate right angles toeachother.[Figure  $I7–3J$  Each canal is filled with fluid and has a section full of fine hairs.Acceleration of the inner ear in any direction causes the tiny hairs to deflect, which in turn stimulates nerve impulses, sending messages to the brain. The vestibular nerve transmits the impulses from the utricle, saccule,and semicircular canals to the brain to interpretmotion.  

The somatosensory system sends signals from the skin, joints, and muscles to thebrain that areinterpreted in relation to the Earth's gravitational pull. These signals determine posture. Inputsfrom each movement update thebody's position to the brain on a constant basis.“Seat of the pants"flying is largely dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual and vestibular clues,these sensations can be fairly reliable. However, thebody cannot distinguish between acceleration forces due to gravity and those resulting from maneuvering theaircraft,which can lead to sensory illusions and false impressions of an aircraft's orientation and movement.  

Undernormalflightconditions,whenthereisavisual reference to thehorizon and ground,the sensorysystem in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch,roll, andyaw movements ofthe aircraft.When visual contact with the horizon is lost, thevestibular system becomes unreliable.Withoutvisual references outside the aircraft, there are many situations in which combinations of normal motions and forces create convincing illusions that are difficult toovercome.  

Prevention is usually the best remedy for spatial disorientation. Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight should be avoided in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is notvisible.A pilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions through training and awareness and learning to rely totally on flight instruments.  

![](images/eaf446ddf29642e5ac432b8ddcba63417b7e561e2d64383d56504c29e5150705.jpg)  
Figure17-3.Thesemicircular canals lieinthree planes and sensemotions of roll,pitch,andyaw.  

# Vestibular Hl lus ions  

# TheLeans  

A condition called theleans,isthemostcommon illusion during flight and is caused by a sudden return tolevel flight following a gradual and prolonged turn that went unnoticed by the pilot. The reason a pilot can be unaware of such a gradual turn is that human exposure to a rotational acceleration of 2 degrees per second orlowerisbelow the detection threshold of the semicircular canals.[Figure17-4]Leveling the wings after such a turn may cause an illusion that the aircraft is banking in the opposite direction. In response to such an illusion,a pilot may lean in the direction of theoriginalturn in a corrective attempt to regain the perception of a correct verticalposture.  

# Coriolis Illusion  

The“coriolis illusion"occurs when a pilot has been in a turn long enough for the fluid in the ear canal to move at the same speed as the canal.A movement of the head in a different plane, such as looking at something in a different part of the flight deck, may set the fluid moving, creating the illusion of turning or accelerating on an entirely different axis. This action causes the pilot to think the aircraft is performing a maneuver it is not. The disoriented pilot may maneuver the aircraft into a dangerous attitude in an attempt to correct the aircraft's perceived attitude.  

For this reason,it is important that pilots develop an instrumentcross-check or s can that involves minimal head movement.Take care when retrieving charts and other objects in theflightdeckif something is dropped,retrieveitwith minimal head movement and be alert for the coriolis illusion.  

# GraveyardSpiral  

As in other illusions, a pilot in a prolonged coordinated. constant-rate turn may experience the illusion of not turning. During the recovery to level flight, the pilot will then experience the sensation of turning in the opposite direction causing the disoriented pilot to return the aircraft toitsoriginalturn.Becauseanaircrafttendstolosealtitude in turns unless the pilot compensates for the loss in lift, the pilot may notice a loss of altitude. The absence of any sensation of turning creates the illusion of being in a level descent. The pilot may pull back on the controls in an attempt to climb or stop the descent. This action tightens the spiral and increases the loss of altitude;this illusion is referred to as a "graveyard spiral." [Figure 17-5] This may lead to a lossof aircraftcontrol.  

# Soma to gra vic Illusion  

A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards. This action may create what is known as the “somatogravic illusion" of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in conditions with poor visual references.The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or dive attitude. A rapid deceleration by quick reduction of the throttle(s)can have the opposite effect,with the disoriented pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose-up or stall attitude.

Figure17-4.Human sensation of angular acceleration  

# InversionIllusion  

An abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight can stimulate the o to li th organs enough to create the illusion of tumbling backwards,known as“inversion illusion."The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft abruptly into a nose- lowattitude,which may intensify this illusion.  

# Elevator Illusion  

An abrupt upward vertical acceleration,ascanoccurinan updraft,canstimulatetheotolithorganstocreatetheillusion of being in a climb. This is known as “elevator illusion." The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low attitude.An abrupt downward vertical acceleration,usually inadowndraft,has the opposite effect with the disoriented pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose-up attitude.  

# Visual Hllusions  

Visual illusions are especially hazardous because pilots rely on their eyes for correct information.Twoillusions thatlead tospatial disorientation,falsehorizon and autokinesis,affect the visual system only  

# FalseHorizon  

A sloping cloudformation,an obscured horizon,an aurora borealis, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide inaccurate visual information,or“falsehorizon,when attempting to align the aircraft withthe actual horizon. The disoriented pilots as a result may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude.  

Autokinesis  

Whenflying in the dark,a stationary light may appear to move if it is stared at for a prolonged period of time. As a result,a pilotmay attempt toalignthe aircraftwith the perceived moving light potentially causinghim/her tolose control of the aircraft.This illusion is known as"autokinesis."  

# Postural Considerations  

The postural system sends signals from the skin, joints, and muscles to the brain that are interpreted in relation to the Earth's gravitational pull. These signals determine posture. Inputs from each movement update thebody's position to the brain on a constant basis.“Seat of the pants" flying is largely dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual and vestibular clues, these sensations can be fairly reliable. However, because of the forces acting upon the body in certain flight situations, many false sensations can occur due to acceleration forces overpowering gravity [Figure17-6]These situations include uncoordinated turns, climbing turns, and turbulence.  

# Demonstration of Spatial Disorientation  

There are a number of controlled aircraft maneuvers a pilot can perform to experiment with spatial disorientation.While each maneuver normally creates a specific illusion, any false sensation is an effective demonstration of disorientation. Thus,even if there is no sensation during any of these maneuvers,the absence of sensation is still an effective demonstration because it illustrates the inability to detect bankorroll.  

![](images/d88f7db29d07b8a2bd8de1e32e22675ef9521529301cb86616fdfa553c7983f3.jpg)  
Skid,slip,and uncoordinated turns feel similar. Pilots feel they are being forced sideways in their seat  

There are several objectives in demonstrating these various maneuvers.  

1。 They teach pilots to understand the susceptibility of the human system to spatial disorientation. 2. They demonstrate that judgments of aircraft attitude based on bodily sensations are frequently false 3. They help decrease the occurrence and degree of disorientation through a better understanding of the relationship between aircraft motion,head movements, and resulting disorientation 4. They help instill a greater confidence in relying on flight instruments for assessingtrue aircraft attitude.  

Apilotshouldnotattemptanyofthesemaneuversat low altitudes or in the absence of aninstructor pilot or an appropriate safety pilot.  

# Climbing While Accelerating  

With the pilot's eyes closed, the instructor pilot maintains approach airspeed in a straight-and-level attitude for several seconds, then accelerates while maintaining straight-and- level attitude.The usual illusion during this maneuver, without visual references, is that the aircraft is climbing.  

# Climbing While Turning  

With the pilot's eyesstill closed and the aircraft in a straight and-level attitude, the instructor pilot now executes, with a relatively slow entry,a well coordinated turn of about 1.5 positiveG(approximately  $50^{\circ}$  bank)for  $90^{\circ}$  .Whileinthe turn,withoutoutsidevisualreferencesandundertheeffectof the slight positive G, the usual illusion produced is that of a climb. Upon sensing the climb, the pilot should immediately open the eyes to see that a slowly established,coordinated turn produces the same sensation as a climb  

# Diving While Turning  

Repeating the previous procedure,butwiththepilot's eyes should be kept closed until recovery from the turn is approximately one-half completed,cancreate the illusion of divingwhile turning.  

# Tilting toRight or Left  

Whilein a straight-and-level attitude,with thepilot's eyes closed, the instructor pilot executes a moderate or slight skid to the left with wings level. This creates the illusion of the bodybeing tilted to the right.  

# Reversal of Motion  

Thisillusion can be demonstrated in anyof thethreeplanes of motion. While straight and level, with the pilot's eyes closed, the instructor pilot smoothly and positively rolls the aircraft to approximately  $45^{\circ}$  bank attitude while maintaining heading and pitch attitude. This creates the illusion of a strong sense of rotation in the opposite direction.After this illusion is noted, the pilot should open his or her eyes and observe that the aircraft is in a banked attitude.  

# Diving orRollingBeyond theVertical Plane  

This maneuver may produce extreme disorientation. While in straight-and-level flight, the pilot should sit normally either with eyes closed or gaze lowered to the floor.The instructorpilotstartsapositive,coordinatedrolltowarda  $30^{\circ}$  Or  $40^{\circ}$   angle of bank. As this is in progress, the pilot tilts his or her head forward, looks to the right or left, then immediately returns his or her head to an upright position. The instructor pilot should time the maneuver so the roll is stopped as the pilot returns his or her head upright.Anintense disorientation is usually produced by this maneuver, and the pilot experiences the sensation of falling downward into the direction of the roll.  

In the descriptions of these maneuvers, theinstructor pilotis doing the flying, but having the pilot do the flying can also be avery effective demonstration.The pilot should close his orhereyesandtilttheheadtooneside.Theinstructorpilot tells the pilot what control inputs toperform.The pilot then attempts to establish the correct attitude or control input with eyes closed and head tilted.While it is clear the pilothas no idea of the actual attitude,he or she will react to what the senses are saying. After a short time, the pilot will become disoriented andtheinstructor pilotwilltellthepilottolook up and recover. This exercise allows the pilot to experience the disorientation while flying the aircraft  

# Coping with Spatial Disorientation  

Toprevent illusions and their potentially disastrous consequences,pilotscan:  

1. Understand the causes of these illusions andremain constantly alert for them.Take the opportunity to experience spatial disorientation illusions in a device, such as a Barany chair, a Vertigon, or a Virtual Reality Spatial Disorientation Demonstrator. 2. Always obtain and understand preflight weather briefings. 3. Before flying in marginal visibility (less than 3 miles) or where a visible horizon is not evident,suchasflight over open water during the night, obtain training and maintain proficiency in aircraft control by reference to instruments. 4 Do not fly into adverse weather conditions or into duskordarknessunlessproficientintheuseofflight instruments. If intending to fly at night, maintain  

night-flight currency and proficiency. Include cross- country and local operations at various airfields. 5. Ensure thatwhen outsidevisual references areused. they are reliable, fixed points on the Earth's surface. 6. Avoid sudden head movement, particularly during takeoffs, turns, and approaches to landing. 7. Be physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility. Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at night, allow for night adaptation. Remember that illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and mild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to spatial disorientation. 8. Most importantly, become proficient in the use of flight instruments and rely upon them.Trust the instruments and disregard your sensory perceptions.  

The sensations that lead to illusions during instrument flight conditions are normal perceptions experienced by pilots.These undesirable sensations cannot be completely prevented,but through training and awareness,pilotscan ignore or suppress them by developing absolute reliance on the flight instruments.As pilots gain proficiency in instrument flying,theybecome less susceptible to these illusions and their effects.  

# Optical Illusions  

Of the senses, vision is the most important for safe flight However,various terrainfeatures and atmospheric conditions can create optical illusions.These illusions are primarily associated with landing. Since pilots must transition from reliance on instruments to visual cues outside the flight deck for landing at the end of an instrument approach, it is imperative that they be aware of the potential problems associated with these illusions and take appropriate corrective action.The major illusions leading tolanding errors are describedbelow.  

# Runway Width ll usi on  

A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is,especially when runwaylength-to-width relationships are comparable [Figure 17-7] The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach, with the risk of striking objects along the approach path or landing short.A wider-than- usual runway can have the opposite effect with the risk of the pilot leveling out the aircraft high and landing hard or overshooting the runway.  

# Runway and Terrain Slopes Illusion  

An upsloping runway, upsloping terrain, or both can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is.[Figure 17-7] The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach. Downsloping runways and downsloping approach terrain canhave the opposite effect.  

# Featureless Terrain Hl lu sion  

An absence of surrounding ground features,as in an overwater approach over darkened areasor terrain made featureless by snow,can create an illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actuallyis.Thisillusion,sometimes referred to as the“black hole approach,”causes pilots to fly a lower approach than is desired.  

# Water Refraction  

Rain on thewindscreen can create an illusion of being at a higher altitudedueto thehorizon appearinglower than it is This can result in the pilot flying a lower approach.  

# Haze  

Atmospherichaze can create anillusion of being at a greater distance and height from the runway. As a result, the pilot has a tendency to be low on the approach.Conversely extremely clear air (clear bright conditions of a high attitude airport) can give the pilot the illusion of being closer than he or she actually is, resulting in a high approach that may result in an overshoot or go around. The diffusion of light due to water particles on the windshield can adversely affect depth perception. The lights and terrain features normally used to gauge height during landing become less effective forthepilot.  

# Fog  

Flying into fog can create an illusion of pitching up. Pilots who do not recognize this illusion often steepen the approach abruptly.  

# Ground Lighting Illusions  

Lights along a straight path, such as a road or lights on moving trains, can be mistaken for runway and approach lights. Bright runway and approach lighting systems, especially where few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain,may create the illusion of less distance to the runway.Thepilotwhodoes not recognize this illusion will often fly a higher approach  

# How To Prevent Landing Errors Due to Optical llusions  

To prevent these illusions and their potentially hazardous consequences,pilotscan:  

1. Anticipate the possibility of visual illusions during approaches to unfamiliar airports, particularly at night or in adverse weather conditions. Consult airport  

![](images/54fbde76d6dd2001e56796c3a97d1cdee2709dbe86f7509afa862f0ee97228fc.jpg)

An up sloping runway can create the illusion that the aircraft is higher than it actually is,leadingtoalower approach.  

Normal approach Approach due to illusion  

4. Use Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) or Precision ApproachPathIndicator (PAPI)systems for a visual reference, or an electronic glideslope. wheneverthey are available. 5. Utilize the visual descent point (VDP) found on many nonprecision instrument approach procedure charts.  

diagrams and the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory)forinformation onrunway slope, terrain, and lighting. Make frequent reference to the altimeter, especially during all approaches, day and night. 3.If possible, conduct an aerial visual inspection of unfamiliar airports beforelanding.  

6. Recognize that the chances of being involved in an approach accident increase when an emergency or other activity distracts from usual procedures. 7. Maintain optimum proficiency in landing procedures.  

In addition to the sensory illusions due to misleading inputs to the vestibular system, a pilot may also encounter various visual illusions during flight. Illusions rank among the most common factorscited as contributing to fatal aviation accidents.  

Sloping cloud formations, an obscured horizon, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground light can create illusions of not being aligned correctly with the actualhorizon.Various surface features and atmospheric conditions encountered in landing can create illusions of being on the wrong approach path. Landing errors due to these illusions can be prevented by anticipating them during approaches, inspecting unfamiliar airports before landing, using electronic glideslope or VASI systems when available, and maintaining proficiency in landing procedures.  

# Motion Sickness  

Motion sickness,or airsickness,is caused by the brain receiving conflicting messages about thestate of thebody.A pilot may experience motion sickness during initial flights,but it generallygoes awaywithin the first few lessons.Anxiety and stress, which may be experienced at the beginning of flighttraining,can contribute to motion sickness.Symptoms of motion sickness include general discomfort,nausea, dizziness,paleness, sweating,and vomiting  

It is important toremember that experiencing airsickness is no reflection on one's ability as a pilot.Ifpronetomotion sickness,let the flight instructor know,there aretechniques thatcanbeusedtoovercomethisproblem.Forexample avoid lessons in turbulent conditions until becoming more comfortableintheaircraftorstartwithshorterflightsand graduate tolonger instruction periods. If symptoms of motion sickness are experienced during a lesson,opening fresh air vents, focusing on objects outside the airplane, and avoiding unnecessaryhead movements may help alleviate some of the discomfort.Although medications like Drama mine can prevent airsickness in passengers, they are not recommended while flying since they can cause drowsiness and other problems.  

# Carbon Monoxide (Co) Poisoning  

CO is a colorless and odorless gas produced by all internal combustion engines. Attaching itself to the hemoglobin in the blood about 200times more easily than oxygen,CO prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells, resulting in hypemic hypoxia. The body requires up to 48 hours to dispose of CO. If severe enough, the CO poisoning can result in death.Aircraft heater vents and defrost vents may provide CO a passageway into the cabin, particularly if the engine exhaust system has aleakoris damaged.If astrong odor of exhaust gases is detected, assume that COis present. However, CO may be present in dangerous amounts even if no exhaust odor is detected. Disposable, inexpensive CO detectors are widely available. In the presence of CO, these detectors change color to alert thepilotof thepresenceof CO. Some effects of CO poisoning are headache, blurred vision, dizziness,drowsiness,and/orloss of musclepower.Any time a pilot smells exhaust odor, or any time these symptoms are experienced,immediate corrective action should betaken including turning off theheater, openingfresh air vents and windows, and using supplemental oxygen, if available  

Tobacco smoke also causes CO poisoning.Smoking at sea level can raise the CO concentration in the blood and result inphysiological effects similartoflying at 8,0o0feet. Besideshypoxia,tobacco causes diseases and ph y sio logic a debilitation that can be medically disqualifying for pilots.  

# Stress  

Stress is the body's response to physical and psychological demands placed upon it. The body's reaction to stress includes releasing chemical hormones(such as adrenaline)intothe blood and increasing metabolism to provide more energy to the muscles. Blood sugar, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and perspiration all increase. The term “stressor" is used to describe an element that causes an individual to experience stress.Examples of stress or s include physical stress (noise or vibration), physiological stress (fatigue), and psychological stress (difficult work or personal situations).  

Stress falls into two broad categories: acute (short term) and chronic (long term).Acute stress involves an immediate threat that is perceived asdanger.This is the type of stress that triggers a"fightorflight"response in an individual,whether the threat is real or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can cope with acute stress and prevent stress overload.However ongoing acute stress can developinto chronic stress.  

Chronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that presents an intolerable burden,exceeds the ability of an individual to cope, and causes individual performance to fall sharply Unrelenting psychological pressures, such as loneliness, financial worries,and relationship or workproblemscan produce a cumulativelevel of stress that exceeds aperson's ability to copewith the situation.When stress reachesthese levels, performance falls off rapidly. Pilots experiencing this level of stress are not safe and should not exercise the in airman privileges.Pilots who suspect they are sufferingfrom chronic stress should consult a physician.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is frequently associated with pilot error.Someof the effects of fatigue include degradation of attention and concentration,impaired coordination,anddecreased ability tocommunicate.These factors seriously influence the ability tomake effective decisions.Physical fatigueresults from sleep loss, exercise, or physical work. Factors such as stress and prolonged performance of cognitive work result inmentalfatigue.  

Likestress,fatigue falls into two broad categories:acute andchronic.Acute fatigue is short term and is a normal occurrence in everyday living.It is the kind of tiredness people feel after a period of strenuous effort, excitement, or lackofsleep.Rest after exertion and 8 hours of sound sleep ordinarily cures this condition.  

A special type of acute fatigue is skill fatigue. This type of fatigue has two main effects on performance:  

Timing disruption appearing toperform a task as usual, but the timing of each component is slightly off. This makes the pattern of the operation less smooth because the pilot performs each component as though it were separate,instead of part of an integrated activity. Disruption of the perceptual field concentrating attention upon movements or objectsin the center of vision and neglecting those in theperiphery.This is accompanied byloss of accuracy and smoothness in control movements.  

Acute fatigue has many causes, but the following are among the most important for the pilot:  

Mild hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) Physical stress Psychological stress Depletion of physical energy resulting from psychological stress Sustained psychological stress  

Sustained psychological stress accelerates the glandular secretions that prepare the body for quick reactions during anemergency.These secretions make the circulatory and respiratory systems work harder, and the liver releases energy to provide the extra fuel needed for brain and muscle work When this reserve energy supply is depleted, the body lapses intogeneralized and severe fatigue.  

Acutefatiguecanbepreventedbyproperdietandadequate rest and sleep.A well-balanced diet prevents the body from needing to consume its own tissues as an energy source. Adequate rest maintains the body's store of vital energy.  

Chronic fatigue, extending over a long period of time, usually has psychological roots, although an underlying disease is sometimes responsible.Continuoushigh-stress levels produce chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue is not relieved by proper diet and adequate rest and sleep and usually requires treatment by a physician. An individual may experience this condition in the form of weakness, tiredness, palpitations of the heart, breathlessness,headaches,orirritability. Sometimes chronic fatigue evencreates stomachor intestinal problems and generalized aches and pains throughout the body. When the condition becomes serious enough, it leads to emotional illness.  

If suffering from acutefatigue,stay on the ground. If fatigue occurs in the flight deck,no amount of training or experience canovercomethedetrimentaleffects.Gettingadequaterest is the only way to prevent fatigue from occurring. Avoid flying without a full night's rest, after working excessive hours, or after an especially exhausting or stressful day.Pilots who suspect they are suffering from chronic fatigue should consult a physician.  

# Exposure to Chemicals  

When conducting preflight and post-flight inspections, pilots must verify that the fluid levels in their aircraft meet the levels specified for safe operations as stated in the Pilot's Operating Handbook. These fluids include, but are not limited to hydraulic fluid, engine oil, and fuel.  

It isimportant that every pilot recognize the potential hazards of working with these fluids as well as the recommended first aidmeasurestofollowshouldanyofthesefluidscomein contact with their eyes, skin,and/or respiratory system.As the specific first aid measures for dealing with exposure to these chemicals can vary by chemical type, it is important that every pilot be familiar with the location and use of theMaterial SafetyDataSheet(MSDS)for each chemical they encounter.  

The procedures described in the following sections are minimum guideline for first aid for each of the indicated scenarios.Ultimately,the pilot should consult the MSDS forfirst aid procedures specific to the typeof chemical and exposurescenario.  

# HydraulicFluid  

Eye Contact immediately flush the eyes with clean water and seek medical attention if irritation occurs. Skin Contactremove all contaminated clothing and thoroughly cleanse the affected areas withmild soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If irritation or redness develops and persists, seek medical attention. Should the hydraulic fluid get into or under the skin. or into any other part of the body, regardless of the appearance of the wound or its size, seek medical attention immediately. Inhalation—if respiratory symptoms develop, move awayfromthesourceofexposureandintofresh air in a position comfortable for breathing. If symptoms persist,seek medical attention. Ingestionfirst aidis not normally required;however. ifswallowed and symptomsdevelop,seek medical attention.  

# Engine Oil  

EyeContact—immediately flush the eyes with clean water and seek medical attention if irritation occurs. Skin Contact remove all contaminated clothing and thoroughly cleanse the affected areas with soap and water.Launder contaminated clothing before reuse. Inhalation move away from the source of exposure and into fresh air. If respiratory irritation, dizziness, nausea,or unconsciousness occurs,seekimmediate medical attention.If breathing stops,assisted ventilation is required via a bag-valve-maskor cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Ingestion—seek immediate medical attention.If immediate medical attention is not available,contact a regional poison control center or emergency medical professional regarding theinduction ofvomiting or use of activated charcoal.Vomiting should never be induced to a person who is groggy or unconscious.  

# Fuel  

Eye Contact immediately flush the eyes with clean water for at least 15minutes and seekmedical attention immediately. Skin Contactremove all contaminated clothing and thoroughly cleanse the affected areas with mild soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If skin surface is damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek medical attention. If irritation or redness develops, seek medical attention. Launder contaminated clothing beforereuse. Inhalation move away from the source of exposure and into fresh air.If breathing stops,assisted ventilationis requiredvia abag-valve-mask or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Once breathing is restored,the use of additional oxygen may be necessary.Seek medical attention immediately. Ingestion—seek immediate medical attention. Do not induce vomiting or take anything by mouth as this may cause the material to enter thelungs and causesevere  

lung damage. Should vomiting occur, keep head below thehips toreduce the risks of aspiration.Monitor for breathing difficulties.Rinse out anymaterial which enters the mouth until the taste is dissipated  

# Dehydration and Heatstroke  

Dehydration is the term given to a critical loss of water from the body. Causes of dehydration are hot flight decks and flight lines, wind, humidity, and diuretic drinks——coffee, tea, alcohol,and caffeinated soft drinks.Some common signs of dehydration are headache, fatigue, cramps, sleepiness, and dizziness.  

The first noticeable effect of dehydration is fatigue,which in turn makes top physical and mental performance difficult if not impossible. Flying for long periods in hot summer temperatures or at high altitudes increases the susceptibility to dehydration because these conditions tend to increase the rate of water loss from the body.  

To help prevent dehydration, drink two to four quarts of water every 24hours.Since each person is physiologically different, this is only a guide. Most people are aware of the eight-glasses-a-day guide:If each glass of water is eight ounces, this equates to 64 ounces, which is two quarts. If this fluid is not replaced, fatigue progresses to dizziness, weakness, nausea, tingling of hands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extremethirst.  

The key for pilots is tobe continually aware of their condition. Most people become thirstywith a1.5quartdeficit or a loss of 2 percent of total bodyweight. This level of dehydration triggers the "thirst mechanism." The problem is that the thirst mechanism arrives too late and is turned off too easily. A smallamountoffluidinthemouthturnsthismechanismoff and the replacement of needed body fluid is delayed.  

Other steps to prevent dehydration include  

Carryingacontainerinordertomeasuredailywater intake. Staying ahead not relying on the thirst sensation as analarm.If plain water is not preferred,addsome sport drinkflavoring tomakeit more acceptable. Limiting daily intake of caffeine and alcohol (both are diureticsandstimulateincreasedproductionofurine)  

Heatstrokeis a condition caused by anyinabilityof thebody to control its temperature.Onset of this condition may be recognized by the symptoms of dehydration, but also has been known to be recognized only upon complete collapse.  

To prevent these symptoms,it is recommended that an ample supply of water be carried and used at frequent intervals on any long flight, whether thirsty or not. The body normally absorbswater at a rate of1.2to1.5 quartsperhour. Individuals should drink one quart per hour for severe heat stress conditions or one pint per hour for moderate stress conditions. If the aircraft has a canopy or roof window, wearinglight-colored,porousclothing and ahatwill help provide protection from the sun. Keeping the flight deck well ventilated aids in dissipating excess heat.  

# Alcohol  

Alcoholimpairstheefficiencyofthehumanbody. [Figure17-8]Studies haveshown that consuming alcohol is closelylinked toperformance deterioration.Pilotsmust make hundreds of decisions, some of them time-critical, during the course of aflight.The safe outcome of anyflight depends on the ability to make the correct decisions and take  

![Figure17-8.Impairment scale with alcohol use. ](images/6b05122c4eb382862c177611f5f99dcd877ab761b7148349d7b57352c54a4539.jpg)  

the appropriate actions during routine occurrences,aswell as abnormal situations. The influence of alcohol drastically reduces the chances of completing a flight without incident. Even in small amounts,alcohol can impair judgment, decrease sense of responsibility,affect coordination,constrict visual field, diminish memory, reduce reasoning ability, and lower attention span.As little as one ounce of alcohol can decrease the speed and strength of muscular reflexes,lessen the efficiency ofeye movements while reading,andincrease thefrequency at whicherrors are committed.Impairments invision andhearingcan occur from consuming as little as Onedrink.  

The alcohol consumed in beer and mixed drinks is ethyl alcohol, a central nervous system depressant. From a medical point of view,it acts on thebody muchlike a general anesthetic. The “dose"is generally much lower and more slowlyconsumedinthecaseofalcohol,butthebasiceffects on the human body are similar.Alcohol is easily and quickly absorbed by the digestive tract. The bloodstream absorbs about 80 to 90 percent of the alcohol in a drink within 30 minutes when ingested on an empty stomach.The body requires about 3 hours to rid itself of all the alcohol contained in onemixeddrinkor onebeer.  

While experiencing a hangover,a pilot is still under the influenceof alcohol.Although a pilot may think he or she is functioning normally, motor and mental response impairment isstillpresent.Considerable amounts of alcohol can remain in the body for over 16 hours,so pilots should be cautious about flying too soon after drinking  

Altitude multiplies the effects of alcohol on the brain.When combined with altitude, the alcohol from two drinks may have the same effect as three or four drinks.Alcohol interferes with the brain's ability to utilize oxygen, producing a form of histotoxic hypoxia.The effects are rapid because alcohol passes quickly into the bloodstream. In addition, the brain is a highly vascular organ that is immediately sensitive to changes in the blood's composition. For a pilot, the lower oxygen availability at altitude and the lower capability of thebrain to use the oxygen that is availablecan addup to a deadly combination.  

Intoxication is determined by the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream. This is usually measured as a percentage by weight in the blood.14 CFR part 91 requires that blood alcohol level be less than .04 percent and that 8 hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting an aircraft.Apilotwith a blood alcohol level of .04 percent or greater after 8 hours cannot fly until the blood alcohol falls below that amount. Even though blood alcohol may be well below.04 percent, a pilot cannot fly sooner than 8 hours after drinking alcohol.  

Although the regulations are quite specific, it is a good idea to be more conservative than the regulations.  

# Drugs  

The Federal Aviation Regulations include no specific references to medication usage. Two regulations, though are important tokeep in mind.Title 14 of the CFR part 61, section61.53prohibits acting aspilot-in-commandorinany other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember, while thatperson:  

1. Knows orhasreasontoknowof anymedical condition that would make thepersonunable tomeet the requirement for the medical certificate necessary fon the pilot operation, or 2. Is taking medication or receiving other treatment for a medical condition that results in the person being unable tomeet the requirements for the medical certificate necessary for thepilot operation.  

Further,14 CFRpart 91,section91.17prohibits the use of any drug that affects the person's faculties in anyway contrary to safety.  

There are several thousand medications currently approved bytheU.S.FoodandDrugAdministration(FDA),not includingOTC(overthecounter）drugs.Virtuallyall medications have the potential for adverse side effects in some people. Additionally, herbal and dietary supplements, sport and energy boosters, and some other "natural"' products are derived from substances often found in medications that could also have adverse side effects.While some individuals experience no side effects with a particular drug or product, othersmaybe noticeably affected.TheFAA regularly reviews FDA and other data to assure that medications found acceptable for aviation duties do not pose an adverse safety risk. Drugs that cause no apparent side effects on the ground can create serious problems at even relatively low altitudes. Even at typical general aviation altitudes, the changes in concentrations of atmospheric gases in the blood can enhance the effects of seemingly innocuous drugs that can result in impaired judgment, decision-making, and performance. In addition, fatigue, stress, dehydration, and inadequate nutrition canincrease an airman's susceptibility to adverse effects from various drugs, even if they appeared to tolerate them in the past. If multiple medications are being taken at the same time, the adverse effects can be even more pronounced.  

Another important consideration is that the medical conditionfor which a medication is prescribed mayitself be disqualifying. The FAA will consider the condition in the context of risk for medical incapacitation, and the medication as well for cognitive impairment, and either or both could be found unacceptablefor medical certification.  

Some of the most commonlyused OTC drugs,antihistamines and decongestants, have the potential to cause noticeable adverse side effects,including drowsiness and cognitive deficits. The symptoms associated with common upper respiratory infections,including the common cold,often suppress a pilot's desire to fly, and treating symptoms with a drug that causes adverse side effects only compounds the problem.Particularly,medications containing diphenhydramine (e.g., Benadryl) are known to cause drowsiness and have a prolonged half-life, meaning the drugs stayinone's system for an extended time,whichlengthens the time that side effects are present  

Many medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives, strong pain relievers, and cough suppressants, have primary effects that may impair judgment, memory, alertness, coordination,vision,and the ability to make calculations. [Figure17-9]Others,such as antihistamines,bloodpressure drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to control diarrhea and motionsickness,have side effects that mayimpair thesame critical functions.Any medication that depresses the nervous system,such as asedative,tranquilizer,orantihistamine,can makeapilotmoresusceptibletohypoxia.  

Painkillers are grouped into twobroad categories: analgesics andanesthetics.Analgesics are drugs that reduce pain while anesthetics are drugs that deaden pain or cause loss ofconsciousness.  

Over-the-counter analgesics,such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofen (Advil), have few side effects when taken in the correct dosage. Although some people are allergic to certain analgesics or may suffer from stomach irritation, flying usually is not restricted when taking these drugs. However, flying is almost always precluded while using prescription analgesics, such as drugs containing propoxyphene (e.g., Darvon), oxycodone (e.g., Percodan), meperidine (e.g., Demerol), and codeine, since these drugs are known to cause side effects,such asmental confusion, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.  

Anesthetic drugs are commonly used for dental and surgical procedures. Most local anesthetics used for minor dental and outpatient procedures wear off within a relatively short period of time.The anesthetic itself maynot limit flying as much as the actual procedure and subsequent pain  

Stimulants are drugs that excite the central nervous system and produce an increase in alertness and activity. Amphetamines, caffeine,and nicotine are all forms of stimulants.Common uses of these drugs include appetite suppression, fatigue reduction, and mood elevation. Some of these drugs may cause a stimulant reaction, even though this reaction is not their primary function. In some cases, stimulants can produce anxiety and mood swings, both of which are dangerous when flying.  

Depressants aredrugs that reduce the body'sfunctioningin many areas.These drugslowerblood pressure,reducemental processing, and slow motor and reaction responses. There are several types of drugs that can cause a depressing effect on the body,including tranquilizers,motion sickness medication, some types of stomach medication,decongestants,and antihistamines.The most common depressant is alcohol.  

![Figure17-9.Adverse affects of various drugs. ](images/2dac6a9f5bab1be1924be203587d811ca4c0e85d66c6f971422cdae46b486595.jpg)  

Some drugs that are classified as neither stimulants nor depressants have adverse effects on flying.Forexample. some antibiotics can produce dangerous side effects,such as balance disorders,hearingloss,nausea,andvomiting While many antibiotics are safe for use while flying,the infection requiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying. In addition, unless specifically prescribed by a physician, do not take more than one drug at a time, and never mix drugs with alcohol because the effects are often unpredictable.  

The dangers of illegal drugs also are well documented. Certainillegal drugs can have hallucinatory effectsthat occur days or weeks after the drug is taken. Obviously, these drugs have no place in the aviation community.  

14 CFR prohibits pilots from performing crewmember duties while using any medication that affects the body in any way contrary to safety.The safest rule is not tofly as a crewmember while taking any medication, unless approved to dosobytheFAA.Ifthereisanydoubtregardingtheeffects of any medication, consult an AME before flying  

Prior to each and every flight,all pilots must do a proper physicalself-assessment to ensure safety.Agreatmnemonic, covered in Chapter 2 on Aeronautical Decision-Making, is IMSAFE,which stands for Illness,Medication,Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, and Emotion.  

For the medication component of IM SAFE,pilotsneedto ask themselves,“Am I taking any medicines that might affect my judgment or make me drowsy?For any new medication, OTCorprescribed,youshouldwaitatleast48hoursafter the first dose beforeflying to determine you do not have any adverse side effects that would make it unsafe to operate an aircraft.In addition to medication questions,pilotsshould also consider the following-  

Do not take any unnecessary or elective medications; Make sureyou eat regular balanced meals; Bring a snack for both you and your passengers for the flight; Maintain good hydration-bringplenty ofwater Ensure adequate sleep the night prior to the flight; and Stay physically fit.  

Additionally, you should wait at least five maximal dosing intervals,the time between recommended or prescribed dosing, (e.g., a dosing interval of 5 to 6 hours would require you to wait 30 hours)beforeflying after taking any medication that has potentially adverse side effects (e.g., sedating or dizziness).Observing the recommended dosing interval doesn't eliminate the risk for adverse side effects because everyone metabolizes medications differently.However, five times the dosing interval is a reasonable rule of thumb.  

# Altitude-Induced Decompression Sickness (DcS)  

Decompression sickness(DCS)describes a condition characterized by a variety of symptoms resulting from exposure to low barometric pressures that cause inert gases (mainly nitrogen), normally dissolved in body fluids and tissues, to come out of physical solution and form bubbles. Nitrogen is an inert gas normally stored throughout the humanbody(tissues andfluids)inphysical solution.When the body is exposed to decreased barometric pressures (as in flying an unpressurized aircraft to altitude or during a rapid decompression),the nitrogen dissolvedin the body comes out of solution.If the nitrogen is forced toleave thesolution too rapidly, bubbles form in different areas of the body causing a variety of signs and symptoms.The most common symptom is joint pain, which is known as“the bends."[Figure 17-10]  

What to do when altitude-induced DC S occurs:  

Put on oxygen mask immediately and switch the regulator to 1o0 percent oxygen. Begin an emergency descent and land as soon as possible.Even if the symptoms disappear during descent, land and seek medical evaluation while continuing tobreathe oxygen. If one of the symptoms is joint pain, keep the affected area still; do not try to work pain out by moving the jointaround. Upon landing, seek medical assistance from an FAA medical officer, AME,military flight surgeon, or a hyperbaric medicine specialist. Be aware that a physician not specialized in aviation or hypobaric medicine may not be familiar with this type of medical problem. Definitive medical treatment may involve the use of a hyperbaric chamber operated by specially-trained personnel. Delayed signs and symptoms of altitude-induced DCS can occur after return to ground level regardless of presence during flight.  

# DC S After Scuba Diving  

Scuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure,which allows more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues and fluids. [Figure17-il] Thereductionof atmospheric pressure that accompanies flying can producephysical problems for scuba divers. A pilot or passenger who intends to fly after scuba divingshouldallowthebodysufficienttimetoriditselfof excess nitrogen absorbed during diving. If not, DCS due to  

![Figure17-1o.Signs and symptoms of altitude decompression sickness. ](images/8e2f158934f5235678bdee79d7f8ba695f9b746fc8c9de97fa28742c73e18fe1.jpg)  

evolved gas can occur during exposure to low altitude and create a serious inflight emergency.  

The recommended waiting time beforegoing toflight altitudes of up to 8,000 feet is at least 12 hours after diving that does not require controlled ascent (non decompression stop diving), and at least 24 hours after diving that does require controlled ascent(decompression stop diving).The waiting time before going to flight altitudes above 8,000 feet should be at least 24 hours after any scuba dive. These recommended altitudes are actual flight altitudes above mean sea level (MSL) and not pressurized cabin altitudes. This takes into consideration the risk of decompression of the aircraft duringflight  

# Vision in Flight  

Of all the senses, vision is the most important for safe flight Most of the things perceived while flying arevisual or heavily supplemented by vision.As remarkable and vital as it is, vision is subject to limitations, such as illusions and blind spots.The more a pilot understands about the eyes and how theyfunction,the easier it is to use vision effectively and compensate for potential problems.  

The eye functions much likea camera.Its structure includes an aperture,a lens,a mechanismfor focusing,and a surface for registering images. Light enters through the cornea at the front of the eyeball, travels through the lens, and falls on the retina.The retina contains light sensitive cells that convert

Figure 17-12. The human eye.  

light energy into electrical impulses that travel through nerves to the brain. The brain interprets the electrical signals to form images. There are two kinds of light-sensitive cells in the eyes:rodsandcones.[Figure17-12]  

The cones are responsible for all color vision,from appreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle shades in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout the retina, but are concentrated toward the center of the field of vision at the backoftheretina.There is a small pit called the fovea where almost all the light sensing cells are cones. This is the area where most “looking”occurs (the center of the visual field wheredetail,color sensitivity,and resolution are highest).  

that a large amount of light overwhelms them,andtheytake longer to“reset”and adapt tothedarkagain.There are so many cones in the fovea that are at the very center of the visual field but virtually has no rods at all.Soinlowlight the middle of the visual field is not very sensitive, but farther from the fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide the major portion ofnightvision.  

# VisionTypes  

There are three types of vision: photopic, mesopic, and scotopic.Each type functions under different sensory stimuli or ambient light conditions.[Figure17-13]  

# PhotopicVision  

Whilethecones and their associated nerves arewellsuited to detecting fine detail and color in high light levels, the rodsarebetter able to detect movement and provide vision in dimlight.Therods are unable to discern color but are very sensitive at low-light levels. The trouble with rods is Photopic vision provides the capabilityfor seeing color and resolving fine detail (20/20 or better),but it functions only in good illumination. Photopic vision is experienced during daylight or when a high level of artificial illumination exists.  

![Figure17-13.Typesofvision ](images/4a789cb08b3b788a8277ee4223701bb7a270cde5b09a5ea5624d60575629a747.jpg)  

The cones concentrated in the fovea central is of theeye are primarily responsiblefor vision in brightlight. [Figure 17-12] Because of the high light level,rhodopsin,which is a biological pigment of the retina that is responsible for both the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events in the perception of light, is bleached out causing the rod cells to become less effective.  

# MesopicVision  

Meso pic vision is achieved by a combination of rods and cones and is experienced at dawn, dusk, and during full moonlight.Visual acuity steadily decreases as available light decreases and color perception changes because the cones become less effective. Mesopic viewing period is considered the most dangerous period for viewing. As cone sensitivity decreases, pilots should use off-center vision and proper scanning techniques todetect objects duringlow-lightlevels.  

# Scotopic Vision  

Sco topic vision is experienced under low-lightlevelsand the cones become ineffective, resulting in poor resolution of detail.Visual acuity decreases to 20/200 or less and enables a person to see only objects the size of or larger than the big"E"onvisual acuitytesting chartsfrom 20feet away. In other words, a person must stand at 20 feet to see what can normally be seen at 200 feet under daylight conditions. When using scotopic vision, color perception is lost and a night blind spot in the central field of view appears at low light levels when the cone-cell sensitivity is lost.  

# Central Blind Spot  

The area where the optic nerve connects to the retina in the back of each eye is known as the optic disk.Thereis a total absence of cones and rods in this area,and consequently each eye is completelyblind in this spot.[Figure 17-14] As a result,it isreferred to as the blind spot that everyone  

![](images/bef25bf08263825ac808e917c3bd6ca3382dc83f188e435f3ef793a837f91c9d.jpg)

On the other hand, where the field of vision of one eye is obstructed by an object(windshield divider or another aircraft),avisualtargetcouldfallintheblindspotofthe other eye and remain undetected.  

Figure 17-15 provides a dramatic example of the eye's blind spot.

With your right eye, stare directly at the airplane on the left side of the picture page. In your periphery, you will notice the black X on the right side of the picture. 4. Slowly move the page closer toyou while continuing to stare at the airplane.

Figure17-15.Theeye'sblindspot  

5. When the page is about 16-18 inches from you, the black X should disappear completely because it has been imaged onto the blind spot of your right eye. (Resist the temptation to move your right eye while the black X is gone or else it reappears. Keep staring at the airplane.) 6. As you continue tolook at the airplane,keepmoving the page closer to you a few more inches, and the black X will comeback into view. 7. There is an interval where you are able to move the page a fewinches backward and forward, and theblack X will be gone. This demonstrates to you the extent of your blind spot. 8. You can try the same thing again, except this time with your right eye covered stare at theblackXwith your left eye. Move the page in closer and the airplane will disappear.

expose the rods to the image. This can be done by looking  $5^{\circ}$  to  $10^{\circ}$  off center of the object tobe seen.This can betried in a dim light in a darkened room. When looking directly at the light, it dims or disappears altogether. When looking slightly off center, it becomes clearer and brighter.

When looking directly at an object, the image is focused mainly on the fovea,where detail is best seen.Atnight,the ability to see an object in the center of the visual field is reducedastheconeslosemuchoftheirsensitivityandthe rods become more sensitive.Looking off center can help compensate for this night blind spot.Along with the loss of  

# Empty-Field Myopia  

![](images/5e149e92c8ca07ee31609f989c562c33b72d39a9357bed7ee743921c03243c79.jpg)  
Figure 17-17. Nightblind spot  

Empty-field myopia is a condition that usually occurs when flying above the clouds or in a haze layer that provides nothing specific to focus on outside the aircraft.Thiscauses theeyes torelax and seek a comfortable focal distancethat may range from 10 to 30 feet. For the pilot, this means looking without seeing, which is dangerous. Searching out and focusing on distant light sources, no matter how dim, helpspreventthe onset of empty-field myopia  

# Night Vision  

There are many good reasons to fly at night, but pilots must keep in mind that the risks of night flying are different than during theday and oftentimes higher.[Figure17-16]Pilots who are cautious and educated on night-flying techniques can mitigate those risks and become very comfortable and proficientinthetask.  

# NightBlindSpot  

It is estimated that once fully adapted to darkness, the rods are 10,0o0 times more sensitive to light than the cones, making them the primary receptors for night vision. Since the cones are concentrated near the fovea,the rods are also responsible for much of the peripheral vision. The concentration of cones in thefoveacanmake a night blind spot in the center of the field of vision.To see an object clearly at night, the pilot must  

sharpness (acuity) and color at night, depth perception and judgment of size maybe lost.[Figure17-17]  

# DarkAdaptation  

Dark adaptationis the adjustment of the human eye to a dark environment. That adjustment takes longer depending on the amount oflight inthe environment that a personhas just left Moving from a bright room into a dark one takes longer than movingfrom a dim room and going into a dark one.  

While the cones adapt rapidly to changes in light intensities, the rods take much longer. Walking from bright sunlight intc a dark movie theater is an example of this dark adaptation period experience. The rods can take approximately 30 minutes to fully adapt to darkness. A bright light, however, can completely destroy night adaptation, leaving night vision severely compromised while the adaptation process isrepeated.  

# Scanning Techniques  

Scanning techniques are very important in identifying objects atnight.To s can effectively,pilots must look from right to leftorleft toright.Theyshould begins canning at the greatest distance an object can be perceived (top) and move inward toward the position of the aircraft (bottom). For each stop, an areaapproximately  $30^{\circ}$  wide should be scanned.Theduration of each stop is based on the degree of detail that is required, but no stop should last longer than 2 to 3 seconds. When moving from one viewing point to the next, pilots should overlap the previous field ofviewby  $10^{\circ}$  .[Figure17-18]  

Off-center viewing is another type of scan that pilots can use during night flying. It is a technique that requires an object be viewedbylooking  $10^{\circ}$  above,below,or to either side of the object. [Figure 17-19] In this manner, the peripheral vision can maintain contactwith an object.  

Withoff-centervision,theimagesof an object viewed longer than 2 to 3 seconds will disappear. This occurs because the rods reach a photochemical equilibrium that prevents any further response until the scene changes.This produces a potentially unsafe operating condition.To overcome this night vision limitation, pilots must be aware of the phenomenon and avoid viewing an object for longer than 2 or3seconds.The peripheral field of vision will continue to pickup the object when theeyes areshiftedfrom one off- center point to another.  

# NightVision Protection  

Several things can be done tohelp with the dark adaptation process and to keep the eyes adapted to darkness.Some of thestepspilots and flightcrewscan taketoprotect theirnight vision are described in the following paragraphs  

![](images/b3c1b4ccd1282971735317b67f9fdf269574a3577ca7b04e7b6a9ac469fd1cb2.jpg)

Figure 17-19. Off-center viewing.  

# Sunglasses  

If a night flightis scheduled,pilots and crew members should wear neutral density(N-i5) sunglasses or equivalent filter lenses when exposed to bright sunlight. This precaution increases the rate of dark adaptation at night and improves night visual sensitivity.  

# Oxygen Supply  

Unaided night vision depends on optimum function and sensitivity of the rods of the retina. Lack of oxygen to the rods (hypoxia) significantly reduces their sensitivity. Sharp clear vision(with the best being equal to 20-20vision)requires significant oxygen especially atnight.Without supplemental oxygen, anindividual's night vision declines measurably at pressure altitudes above 4,ooo feet. As altitude increases, the available oxygen decreases, degrading night vision. Compounding the problem is fatigue, which minimizes physiological well being. Adding fatigue to high altitude exposure is a recipe for disaster. In fact, if flying at night at an altitude of 12,000 feet, the pilot may actually see elements of his or her normal vision missing or not in focus. Missing visual elements resemble the missing pixels in a digital image while un focused vision is dim and washed out.  

For the pilot suffering the effects of hypoxic hypoxia,a simple descent to a lower altitude may not be sufficient to reestablish vision.Forexample,aclimbfrom8,000feetto12,000feetfor 30 minutes does not mean a descent to8,0o0feetwill rectify theproblem.Visual acuity may not be regained for over an hour. Thus, it is important to remember, altitude and fatigue have a profound effect on a pilot'sabilitytosee.  

# High Intensity Lighting  

If, during the flight, any high intensity lighting areas are encountered, attempt to turn the aircraft away and fly in the periphery of the lighted area. This will not expose the eyes to such a large amount oflight all at once. If possible,planyour route toavoid direct over flight of built-up,brightlylit areas.  

# Flight deck Lighting  

Flightdeck lighting should be kept as low as possible so that the light does not monopolize night vision. After reaching the desired flight altitude,pilots should allow time to adjust to the flight conditions.This includes readjustment of instrument lights and orientation to outside references. During the adjustment period, night vision should continue to improve until optimum night adaptation is achieved.When itisnecessarytoread maps,charts,and checklists,use adim white light flashlight and avoid shining it in your or any other crewmember'seyes.  

# Airfield Precautions  

Often time, pilots have no say in how airfield operations are handled, but listed below are some precautions that can be taken to make night flying safer and help protect night vision.  

Airfield lighting should be reduced to the lowest usableintensity. Maintenance personnel should practice light discipline with headlights and flashlights. Position the aircraft at a part of the airfieldwhere the least amount of lighting exists.  

Select approachand departure routesthat avoid highways and residential areaswhere illumination can impair night vision.  

# Self-Imposed Stress  

Night flight can be more fatiguing and stressful than day flight, and many self- imposed stressors can limit night vision. Pilots can control this type of stress byknowing thefactors that can cause self-imposed stress or s.Some of these factors are listed in the following paragraphs.[Figure17-20]  

Drugs  

Drugs can seriously degradevisual acuity during the day and especially at night. Pilots whobecome ill should consult an aviation medical examiner (AME) or flight surgeon as to which drugs are appropriateto takewhileflying  

Exhaustion  

Pilots who become fatigued during a night flight will not be mentally alert and will respond more slowly to situations requiring immediate action.Exhausted pilots tend to concentrate on one aspect of a situation without considering the total requirement. Their performance may become a safetyhazard depending on the degree of fatigue andinstead of using proper scanning techniques may get fixated on the instrumentsorstareoffratherthanmultitask.  

# PoorPhysical Conditioning  

To overcome poor physical conditioning,pilots should participate in regular exercise programs.Peoplewhoare physically fit become less fatigued during flight and have better night scanning efficiency.However, too much exercise inagivendaymayleavecrewmemberstoofatiguedfor nightflying.  

Alcohol  

Alcohol is a sedative and its use impairs both coordination and judgment. As a result, pilots who are impaired by alcohol fail to apply the proper techniques of night vision. They are likely to stare at objects and to neglect scanning techniques. Theamountofalcoholconsumeddeterminesthedegreeto which night vision is affected. The effects of alcohol are long lasting and the residual effects of alcohol can alsoimpair visual scanning efficiency.  

# Tobacco  

Of all the self-imposed stressors,cigarette smoking most decreases visual sensitivity at night. Smoking significantly increases the amount of carbon monoxide carried by the hemoglobin in red blood cells.This reduces the blood's capacity to combine with oxygen,soless oxygenis carried in the blood.Hypoxia caused by carbon monoxide poisoning

affects peripheral vision and dark adaptation. The results are the same as those for hypoxia caused by high altitude. Smoking 3 cigarettes in rapid succession or 20 to 30 cigarettes within a 24-hour period may saturate from 8 to10 percent of the capacity of hemoglobin.Smokers lose 20 percent of their night vision capability at sea level, which is equal to a physiological altitudeof 5,0o0feet.  

# Hypoglycemia and Nutritional Deficiency  

Missing or postponing meals can cause low blood sugar, which impairs night flight performance. Low blood sugar levels may result in stomach contractions, distraction, breakdown in habit pattern, and a shortened attention span. Likewise, an insufficient consumption of vitamin A may also impair night vision. Foods high in vitamin A include eggs, butter, cheese, liver, apricots, peaches, carrots, squash, spinach, peas, and most types of greens. High quantities of vitamin A do not increase night vision but a lack of vitamin A certainly impairs it  

# Distance Estimation and Depth Perception  

Knowledge of the mechanisms and cues affecting distance estimation and depthperception assist pilotsin judging distances at night.These cues maybe mon ocular orbinocular. Them on ocular cues that aid in distance estimation anddepth perception include motion parallax, geometric perspective, retinal imagesize,and aerial perspective  

# MotionParallax  

Motion parallax refers to the apparentmotion of stationary objects as viewed by an observer moving across the landscape. When the pilot or crewmember looks outside the aircraft perpendicular to the direction of travel,nearobjects appear to move backward, past, or opposite the path of motion; far objects seem to move in the direction of motion orremainfixed.The rate of apparent movement depends on the distance the observer is from theobject  

Geometric Perspective  

Anobject may appear tohave a different shape when viewed atvaryingdistancesandfromdifferentangles.Geometric perspective cues include linear perspective, apparent foreshortening, and vertical position in thefield.  

Linear perspective——parallel lines, such as runway lights, power lines and railroad tracks, tend to converge as distance from the observer increases. [Figure17-21A] Apparent foreshortening the true shape of anobject or a terrain feature appears elliptical when viewed from a distance.[Figure17-21B] Vertical position in the field—objects or terrain featuresfarther awayfrom the observer appearhigher on the horizon than those closer to the observer. [Figure17-21C]  

# Aerial Perspective  

Theclarityofanobjectandtheshadowcastbyitare perceived by the brain and are cues for estimating distance. Subtle variations in color or shade are clearer the closer the observer is to an object. However, as distance increases, these distinctions may become blurry. The same applies to an object detail or texture. As a person gets farther from an object, its discrete details become less apparent. Another important fact to remember while flying at night is that every object casts a shadow from a light source. The direction in which the shadow is cast depends on thepositionof thelight source.If theshadowof an object is cast toward the observer, the object is closer than thelight source is to the observer.  

# Binocular Cues  

Binocular cues of an object are dependent upon the slightly different viewing angle of each eye of an object. Binocular perception is useful only when the object is close enough to make an obvious differencein theviewing angleofboth eyes. In theflight environment,most distances outside the cockpit are sogreat that binocular cues are oflittle,if any,value.In addition, binocular cues operate on a more subconscious level than monocular cues and are performed automatically.  

# Night Vision Illusions  

There are many different types of visual illusions that commonly occur at night. Anticipating and maintaining awareness of them is usually the best way to avoid them.  

# Autokinesis  

Auto kin es is is caused by staring at a single point of light against a dark background for more than a few seconds. After a few moments, the light appears to move on its own. Apparent movement of the light source will begin in about 8 to 10 seconds. To prevent this illusion, focus the eyes on objects at varying distances and avoidfixating on one source of light. This illusion can be eliminated or reduced by visual scanning, by increasing the number of lights, or by varying the light intensity. The most important of the three solutions is visual scanning. A light or lights should not be stared at for more than 10 seconds.  

# FalseHorizon  

A false horizon can occur when the natural horizon is obscured or not readily apparent.It can be generated by confusing bright stars and city lights. It can also occur while flying toward the shore of an ocean or alarge lake. Because of the relative darkness of the water, the lights along the shoreline can be mistaken for stars in the sky.[Figure17-22]  

# Reversible Perspective Illusion  

At night, an aircraft may appear to be moving away from a second aircraft when it is, in fact, approaching a second aircraft. This illusion often occurs when an aircraft is flying  

![](images/1e5ff43bc17bc261abfe1011c6f6a4071432fcfc54138e9ef4809b964f6cd305.jpg)

Figure 17-22. At night, the horizon may be hard to discern due to dark terrain and misleading light patterns on the ground.  

parallel to another'scourse.To determine the direction of flight,pilots should observe aircraft lights and their relative position to the horizon. If the intensity of the lights increases, the aircraft is approaching; if the lights dim, the aircraft is movingaway.  

# Size-Distance Illusion  

This illusion results from viewing a source oflight that is increasing or decreasing inluminance (brightness). Pilots may interpret the light as approaching or retreating  

# Fascination (Fixation)  

This illusion occurs when pilots ignore orientation cues and fix their attention on a goal or an object. Student pilots tend to have this happenwhen they are concentratingon the aircraft instruments or attempting to land. They become fixated on one task andforget tolook at what is goingon around them. At night, this can be especially dangerous because aircraft ground-closure rates are difficult to determine, and there may be minimal time to correct the situation.  

# Flicker Vertigo  

A light flickering at a rate between 4 and 20 cycles per second can produce unpleasant and dangerous reactions. Such conditions as nausea,vomiting,and vertigo may occur. On rare occasions, convulsions and unconsciousness may alsc occur. Proper scanning techniques at night can prevent pilots fromgettingflickervertigo  

# Night Landing Illusions  

Landing illusions occur in many forms.Above featureless terrain at night, there is a natural tendency to fly a lower- than-normal approach.Elements that cause any type of visual obscurities, such as rain, haze, or a dark runway environment, can also causelow approaches.Bright lights.  

steepsurroundingterrain,andawiderunwaycanproducethe illusion of being toolow with a tendency tofly a higher-than- normal approach.A set of regularly spaced lights alongaroad or highway can appear to be runway lights.Pilots have even mistaken the lights on moving trains as runway or approach lights.Bright runway or approach lighting systems can create the illusion that the aircraft is closer to the runway,especially wherefewlightsilluminatethesurroundingterrain.  

Prior to flying at night, it is best to learn and know the challenges of the area in which you are flying in. Study the area and know how to navigate your way through areas that may pose a problem at night.For example,many areas near water may be obscured by low lying clouds or fog. To help deal with this type of situation, it is important to have a plan before you leave the ground. In the daytime, fly the routes and passes that you will be flying at night and determine the minimum altitude you are willing to use at night.Ifweather prevents you from maintaining the altitude that you planned, make a decision early to turn  $180^{\circ}$  and land at an alternate airport with better weather conditions.Alwaysconsider safer alternatives rather than hope things will work out by taking a chance.  

Pilots who fly at night should strongly consider oxygen supplementation at altitudes and times not required by the FAA, especially at night when critical judgment and hand-eye coordination is necessary (e.g., IFR) or if he/she is a smoker or not perfectly healthy.  

# Enhanced NightVision Systems  

Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS)and Enhanced FlightVision Systems(EFVS)are two systems that can improve the safety of flight atnight.Thetechnology of both is evolvingrapidly and being used more and more.[Figure17-23]  

![](images/4f64dda7dde0b7ca6c644eaf8fc179ef788152f3448f93efb5c6932d6f4ba6d6.jpg)  
Figure17-23.Synthetic and enhanced vision systems  

# Synthetic Vision System  

A Synthetic Vision System(SVs)is an electronic means to display a synthetic vision image of the external scene topography to the flight crew.[Figure17-24] It is not a real-time image like that produced by an EF VS.Unlike EFVS,SVSrequires a terrain and obstacle database,a precise navigation solution,andadisplay.Theterrain image is based on the use of data from a Digital Elevation Model(DEM)that is stored within the S VS.WithSVS,the synthetic terrain/vision image is intended to enhance pilot awareness of spatial position relative to important features in all visibility conditions. This is particularly useful during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff, approach, and landing, where important features, such as terrain, obstacles, runways,andlandmarks,may be depicted on the SVS display.[Figure 17-25] During approach operations, the

Figure17-24.SVSsystem.  

obvious advantagesofSVS arethat thedigital terrainimage remains on the pilot's display regardless of howpoor the visibility is outside.  

An S VS image can be displayed on either ahead-down display or head-up display (HUD); however, to date, SVS has only been certified on head-down displays. Development efforts todisplay a synthetic image on a HUD are currently underway as are efforts that would combineS VS with a real- time sensorimage produced by an EFVs.These systems are known as Combined Vision Systems.WhileSVSis currently certified as an aid to situation awareness only,the FAA and aviation industry are working on defining operational concepts and air worthiness criteria that would enableS Vs tobeused for operational credit in certain low visibility conditions.Other future enhancements to S VS displays could include integrating ADS-B to display traffic information.  

# Enhanced Flight Vision System  

Enhanced Vision(EV)or Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS) is an electronic means to provide a display of

the external scene by use of an imaging sensor,suchas a Forward-Looking InfraRed(FLIR) or millimeter wave radar (MMWR).In 2004,14 CFRpart 91,section 91.175 was amended to reflect that operators conducting straight- in instrument approach procedures (in other than Category II or CategoryIff operations)maynow operatebelow the published decisionheight (DH) or minimum descent altitude (MDA) when using an approved EFVS shown on the pilot's HUD. This rule change provides “operational credit" for EV equipage.Nosuch credit exists for SV.
