# If my personal physician believes I am  fit to fly, why am I unable to obtain  certification?  

If your personal physician believes you are fit to fly,  it is important to understand that their assessment is  primarily focused on your overall health and well- being. However, the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) must ensure compliance with Title 14 CFR Part  67, which governs the medical standards for aviation  safety. Your physician may not fully consider the  specific medical risks and unique demands associated  with operating an aircraft. The FAA’s certification  process is designed to address these aviation- specific safety concerns and ensure that any medical  conditions do not compromise safe flight operations.  Therefore, even if your personal doctor deems you  healthy, the FAA must ensure that you meet the  required medical standards under this regulation.

# What are my chances of ultimately   being certified?  

# When There Are Questions About Your  Medical Certification Qualifications  

While it is impossible to predict your individual  likelihood of certification, our current process allows us  ultimately to certify  $96\%$   of individuals whose medical  qualifications are initially questioned. Sometimes this  process requires a period of recovery from an illness,  surgery, or other condition.  

A checklist for speeding your medical certification  

Most (more than  $95\%$  ) medical certification applicants  pass their physical examinations, and the Aviation  Medical Examiner (AME) is able to issue a medical  certificate at the time of the exam. However,  occasionally, a condition is found that requires a process  of further review and, possibly, additional testing. The  purpose of this brochure is to help answer some of the  questions that you might have about this process.  

# Why does it take so long to process my  application and other reports?  

We receive an average of 1800 applications for medical  certification each day. We are required to review each  to assure that medical standards are met. When an  application is found that may not meet the requirements,  a letter is written to the applicant identifying the  problem and outlining the further potential courses  of action. We must then wait for a response from the  applicant before we can proceed further. Each time  new information is received, the application package  must again be reviewed. Given the large number of  applications being processed and the amount of time  required to evaluate the information, it sometimes  takes longer than we all would like.  

# What can I do to speed the   process along?  

There are several steps you can take to assure that  your application package is processed in the shortest  time possible. Use this list of items like a checklist to speed the processing of your application.  

•	Don’t hesitate to ask your AME for advice and  assistance in gathering the requested information.  

•	When we ask for additional information, we  ask for the least amount possible to make our  decision. This means that we really do need  everything that we request, so the first thing  that you can do is to make sure that all the  information that we have requested is being  provided. Also, please understand, if we ask that  a certain test be performed in a certain way, that  is what we need. Be sure that you take all of  our letters with you to your physician, and try to  emphasize the importance of exactly fulfilling 
 our requests.  

•	Have your designated AME upload all of the  required information or have all of the information  forwarded to us in one package.  

•	Please disclose all medical information as  indicated in your MedXPress application. Failure  to completely disclose the information will cause  delays in the process of your application.
