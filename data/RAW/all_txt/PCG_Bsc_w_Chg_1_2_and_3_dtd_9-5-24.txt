# PILOT/CONTROLLER  GLOSSARY  

# PURPOSE  

a.  This Glossary was compiled to promote a common understanding of the terms used in the Air Traffic  Control system. It includes those terms which are intended for pilot/controller communications. Those terms  most frequently used in pilot/controller communications are printed in  bold italics . The definitions are primarily  defined in an operational sense applicable to both users and operators of the National Airspace System. Use of  the Glossary will preclude any misunderstandings concerning the system’s design, function, and purpose.  

b.  Because of the international nature of flying, terms used in the Lexicon, published by the International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are included when they differ from FAA definitions. These terms are  followed by “[ICAO].” For the reader’s convenience, there are also cross references to related terms in other parts  of the Glossary and to other documents, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM).  

c.  Terms used in this glossary that apply to flight service station (FSS) roles are included when they differ  from air traffic control functions. These terms are followed by “[FSS].”  

d.  This Glossary will be revised, as necessary, to maintain a common understanding of the system.

It includes only a small portion of the usual IFR flight plan  information. In certain instances, this may be only aircraft identification, location, and pilot request. Other  information may be requested if needed by ATC for separation/control purposes. It is frequently used by aircraft  which are airborne and desire an instrument approach or by aircraft which are on the ground and desire a climb  to VFR-on-top.  

ABEAM−  An aircraft is “abeam” a fix, point, or object when that fix, point, or object is approximately 90 degrees  to the right or left of the aircraft track. Abeam indicates a general position rather than a precise point.  

ABORT−  To terminate a preplanned aircraft maneuver; e.g., an aborted takeoff.

ADAPTED ROUTES− Departure and/or arrival routes that are adapted in ARTCC ERAM computers to  accomplish inter/intrafacility controller coordination and to ensure that flight data is posted at the proper control  positions. Adapted routes are automatically applied to flight plans where appropriate. When the workload or  traffic situation permits, controllers may provide radar vectors or assign requested routes to minimize circuitous  routing. Adapted routes are usually confined to one ARTCC’s area and are referred to by the following names  or abbreviations:  

a.  Adapted Arrival Route (AAR). A specific arrival route from an appropriate en route point to an airport or  terminal area. A Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) and/or a partial Preferred IFR Route may be included in an  

AAR.  b.  Adapted Departure Route (ADR). A specific departure route from an airport or terminal area to an en route  point where there is no further need for flow control. An Instrument Departure Procedure (DP) and/or a partial  Preferred IFR Route may be included in an ADR.  c.  Adapted Departure and Arrival Route (ADAR). A route between two terminals which are within or  immediately adjacent to one ARTCC’s area. ADARs are similar to Preferred IFR Routes and may share  components, but they are not synonymous.  (See PREFFERED IFR ROUTES.)  ADAR−  (See ADAPTED ROUTES.)  ADDITIONAL SERVICES− Advisory information provided by ATC which includes but is not limited to the  following:  a.  Traffic advisories.  b.  Vectors, when requested by the pilot, to assist aircraft receiving traffic advisories to avoid observed traffic.  c.

Advisories that traffic is no longer a factor.  e.  Weather and chaff information.  f.  Weather assistance.  g.  Bird activity information.  h.  Holding pattern surveillance. Additional services are provided to the extent possible contingent only upon  the controller’s capability to fit them into the performance of higher priority duties and on the basis of limitations  of the radar, volume of traffic, frequency congestion, and controller workload. The controller has complete  discretion for determining if he/she is able to provide or continue to provide a service in a particular case. The  controller’s reason not to provide or continue to provide a service in a particular case is not subject to question  by the pilot and need not be made known to him/her.

AIR TRAFFIC [ICAO]− All aircraft in flight or operating on the maneuvering area of an aerodrome.  AIR TRAFFIC CLEARANCE− An authorization by air traffic control for the purpose of preventing collision  between known aircraft, for an aircraft to proceed under specified traffic conditions within controlled airspace.  The pilot-in-command of an aircraft may not deviate from the provisions of a visual flight rules (VFR) or  instrument flight rules (IFR) air traffic clearance except in an emergency or unless an amended clearance has  been obtained. Additionally, the pilot may request a different clearance from that which has been issued by air  traffic control (ATC) if information available to the pilot makes another course of action more practicable or if  aircraft equipment limitations or company procedures forbid compliance with the clearance issued. Pilots may  also request clarification or amendment, as appropriate, any time a clearance is not fully understood, or  considered unacceptable because of safety of flight. Controllers should, in such instances and to the extent of  operational practicality and safety, honor the pilot’s request. 14 CFR Part 91.3(a) states: “The pilot in command  of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.” THE PILOT  IS RESPONSIBLE TO REQUEST AN AMENDED CLEARANCE if ATC issues a clearance that would cause  a pilot to deviate from a rule or regulation, or in the pilot’s opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy.  (See ATC INSTRUCTIONS.)  (See ICAO term AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCE.)

The DRAG point is a published location  on an ASLAR approach where aircraft landing second in a formation slows to a predetermined airspeed. The  DRAG point is the reference point at which MARSA applies as expanding elements effect separation within a  flight or between subsequent participating flights.  

b.  ASLAR procedures shall be covered in a Letter of Agreement between the responsible USAF military ATC  facility and the concerned Federal Aviation Administration facility. Initial Approach Fix spacing requirements  are normally addressed as a minimum.  

AIRCRAFT HAZARD AREA (AHA)− Used by ATC to segregate air traffic from a launch vehicle, reentry  vehicle, amateur rocket, jettisoned stages, hardware, or falling debris generated by failures associated with any  of these activities. An AHA is designated via NOTAM as either a TFR or stationary ALTRV. Unless otherwise  specified, the vertical limits of an AHA are from the surface to unlimited.  

(See CONTINGENCY HAZARD AREA.)  (See REFINED HAZARD AREA.)  (See TRANSITIONAL HAZARD AREA.)  

AIRCRAFT WAKE TURBULENCE CATEGORIES− For the purpose of Wake Turbulence Re categorization  (RECAT) Separation Minima, ATC groups aircraft into categories ranging from Category A through Category  I, dependent upon the version of RECAT that is applied. Specific category assignments vary and are listed in  the RECAT Orders.  

AIRMEN’S METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION (AIRMET)−  A concise description of an occurrence or  expected occurrence of specified en route weather phenomena that may affect the safety of aircraft operations,  but at intensities lower than those that require the issuance of a SIGMET.

A five−letter identifier  denoting a CNF can be found next to an “x” on en route charts and on some approach charts. Eventually, all CNFs  will be labeled and begin with the letters “CF” followed by three consonants (e.g., ‘CFWBG’). CNFs are not  recognized by ATC, are not contained in ATC fix or automation databases, and are not used for ATC purposes.  Pilots should not use CNFs for point−to−point navigation (e.g., proceed direct), filing a flight plan, or in  aircraft/ATC communications. Use of CNFs has not been adopted or recognized by the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO).  (REFER to AIM 1−1−17b5(i)(2), Global Positioning System (GPS).

b.  Controlled airspace is also that airspace within which all aircraft operators are subject to certain pilot  qualifications, operating rules, and equipment requirements in 14 CFR Part 91 (for specific operating  requirements, please refer to 14 CFR Part 91). For IFR operations in any class of controlled airspace, a pilot must  file an IFR flight plan and receive an appropriate ATC clearance. Each Class B, Class C, and Class D airspace  area designated for an airport contains at least one primary airport around which the airspace is designated (for  specific designations and descriptions of the airspace classes, please refer to 14 CFR Part 71).  

c.  Controlled airspace in the United States is designated as follows:  

1.  CLASS A− Generally, that airspace from 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL 600, including the  airspace overlying the waters within 12 nautical miles of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska. Unless  otherwise authorized, all persons must operate their aircraft under IFR.  

2.  CLASS B− Generally, that airspace from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest  airports in terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The configuration of each Class B airspace  area is individually tailored and consists of a surface area and two or more layers (some Class B airspace areas  resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument procedures once an  aircraft enters the airspace. An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area, and all aircraft  that are so cleared receive separation services within the airspace. The cloud clearance requirement for VFR  operations is “clear of clouds.”  

3.  CLASS C− Generally, that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted  in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach  control, and that have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration  of each Class C area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface area with a 5 NM radius,  a circle with a   $10\:\bf{N M}$   radius that extends no lower than 1,200 feet up to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation,  and an outer area that is not charted. Each person must establish two-way radio communications with the ATC  facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those communications  while within the airspace. VFR aircraft are only separated from IFR aircraft within the airspace.  

# (See OUTER AREA.)  

4.  CLASS D− Generally, that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted  in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower. The configuration of each Class D  airspace area is individually tailored and when instrument procedures are published, the airspace will normally  be designed to contain the procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures may be Class D  or Class E airspace. Unless otherwise authorized, each person must establish two-way radio communications  with the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those  communications while in the airspace. No separation services are provided to VFR aircraft.  

5.  CLASS E− Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, Class B, Class C, or Class D, and it is controlled  airspace, it is Class E airspace. Class E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude  to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a surface area, the airspace will be  configured to contain all instrument procedures. Also in this class are Federal airways, airspace beginning at  either 700 or 1,200 feet AGL used to transition to/from the terminal or en route environment, en route domestic,  and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E  airspace begins at   $14{,}500~\mathrm{MSL}$   over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12  nautical miles of the coast of the 48 contiguous States and Alaska, up to, but not including 18,000 feet MSL,  and the airspace above FL 600.

Coupled instrument approaches are commonly flown to the allowable IFR weather minima  established by the operator or PIC, or flown VFR for training and safety.  

COUPLED SCHEDULING (CS)/ EXTENDED METERING (XM)− Adds additional Constraint Satisfaction  Points for metered aircraft along their route. This provides the ability to merge flows upstream from the meter  fix and results in a more optimal distribution of delays over a greater distance from the airport, increased meter  list accuracy, and more accurate delivery to the meter fix.

CRUISE−  Used in an ATC clearance to authorize a pilot to conduct flight at any altitude from the minimum IFR  altitude up to and including the altitude specified in the clearance. The pilot may level off at any intermediate  altitude within this block of airspace. Climb/descent within the block is to be made at the discretion of the pilot.  However, once the pilot starts descent and verbally reports leaving an altitude in the block, he/she may not return  to that altitude without additional ATC clearance. Further, it is approval for the pilot to proceed to and make an  approach at destination airport and can be used in conjunction with:  

a.  An airport clearance limit at locations with a standard/special instrument approach procedure. The CFRs  require that if an instrument letdown to an airport is necessary, the pilot shall make the letdown in accordance  with a standard/special instrument approach procedure for that airport, or  

b.  An airport clearance limit at locations that are within/below/outside controlled airspace and without a  standard/special instrument approach procedure. Such a clearance is NOT AUTHORIZATION for the pilot to  descend under IFR conditions below the applicable minimum IFR altitude nor does it imply that ATC is  exercising control over aircraft in Class G airspace; however, it provides a means for the aircraft to proceed to  destination airport, descend, and land in accordance with applicable CFRs governing VFR flight operations.  Also, this provides search and rescue protection until such time as the IFR flight plan is closed.  (See INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE.)

(See CLUTTER.)  

GROUND COMMUNICATION OUTLET (GCO)−  An unstaffed, remotely controlled, ground/ground  communications facility. Pilots at uncontrolled airports may contact ATC and FSS via VHF radio to a telephone  connection. If the connection goes to ATC, the pilot can obtain an IFR clearance or close an IFR flight plan. If  the connection goes to Flight Service, the pilot can open or close a VFR flight plan; obtain an updated weather  briefing prior to takeoff; close an IFR flight plan; or, for Alaska or MEDEVAC only, obtain an IFR clearance.  Pilots will use four “key clicks” on the VHF radio to contact the appropriate ATC facility or six “key clicks” to  contact the FSS. The GCO system is intended to be used only on the ground.  

GROUND CONTROLLED APPROACH− A radar approach system operated from the ground by air traffic  control personnel transmitting instructions to the pilot by radio. The approach may be conducted with  surveillance radar (ASR) only or with both surveillance and precision approach radar (PAR). Usage of the term 

 “GCA” by pilots is discouraged except when referring to a GCA facility. Pilots should specifically request a 

 “PAR” approach when a precision radar approach is desired or request an “ASR” or “surveillance” approach  when a nonprecision radar approach is desired.  (See RADAR APPROACH.)  

GROUND DELAY PROGRAM (GDP)− A traffic management process administered by the ATCSCC, when  aircraft are held on the ground. The purpose of the program is to support the TM mission and limit airborne  holding. It is a flexible program and may be implemented in various forms depending upon the needs of the AT  system. Ground delay programs provide for equitable assignment of delays to all system users.  

GROUND SPEED− The speed of an aircraft relative to the surface of the earth.  

GROUND STOP (GS)− The GS is a process that requires aircraft that meet a specific criteria to remain on the  ground. The criteria may be airport specific, airspace specific, or equipment specific; for example, all departures  to San Francisco, or all departures entering Yorktown sector, or all Category I and II aircraft going to Charlotte.  GSs normally occur with little or no warning.

ICAO approves 3LDs to enhance the safety and security of the air traffic system. An ICAO 3LD may  be assigned to a company, agency, or organization and is used instead of the aircraft registration number for ATC  operational and security purposes. An ICAO 3LD is also used for aircraft identification in the flight plan and  associated messages and can be used for domestic and international flights. A telephony associated with an  ICAO 3LD is used for radio communication.  

ICING− The accumulation of airframe ice.  

Types of icing are:  

a.  Rime Ice− Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water  droplets.  

b.  Clear Ice− A glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large supercooled  water droplets.  

Intensity of icing:  

a.  Trace− Ice becomes noticeable. The rate of accumulation is slightly greater than the rate of sublimation.  A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is less than  $\%$   inch   $(6\,\mathrm{mm})$   per hour on the outer wing. The  pilot should consider exiting the icing conditions before they become worse.  

ice accretions on the airframe. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is  $\%$   inch to 1 inch (0.6 to  2.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition.  c.  Moderate− The rate of ice accumulation requires frequent cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize  ice accretions on the airframe. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5  cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition as  soon as possible.  d.  Severe− The rate of ice accumulation is such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation  of ice and ice accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing, such as areas aft of protected surfaces and  any other areas identified by the manufacturer. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is more than  3 inches   $(7.5\,\mathrm{cm})$   per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. By regulation, immediate exit is required.  Note:  Severe icing is aircraft dependent, as are the other categories of icing intensity. Severe icing may occur at  

any ice accumulation rate when the icing rate or ice accumulations exceed the tolerance of the aircraft.  

IDAC−  (See INTEGRATED DEPARTURE/ARRIVAL CAPABILITY.)  IDENT−  A request for a pilot to activate the aircraft transponder identification feature.

IFR TAKEOFF MINIMUMS AND DEPARTURE PROCEDURES− Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations  Part 91, prescribes standard takeoff rules for certain civil users. At some airports, obstructions or other factors  require the establishment of nonstandard takeoff minimums, departure procedures, or both to assist pilots in  avoiding obstacles during climb to the minimum en route altitude. Those airports are listed in FAA/DoD  Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) Charts under a section entitled “IFR Takeoff Minimums and Departure  Procedures.” The FAA/DoD IAP chart legend illustrates the symbol used to alert the pilot to nonstandard takeoff  minimums and departure procedures. When departing IFR from such airports or from any airports where there  are no departure procedures, DPs, or ATC facilities available, pilots should advise ATC of any departure  limitations. Controllers may query a pilot to determine acceptable departure directions, turns, or headings after  takeoff. Pilots should be familiar with the departure procedures and must assure that their aircraft can meet or  exceed any specified climb gradients.  

IF/IAWP− Intermediate Fix/Initial Approach Waypoint. The waypoint where the final approach course of a T  approach meets the crossbar of the T.

Departing flights may receive a  wind shear alert after they start the takeoff roll and may elect to abort the takeoff. Aircraft on approach receiving  an alert may elect to go around or perform a wind shear escape maneuver.  

PREFERRED IFR ROUTES− Routes established between busier airports to increase system efficiency and  capacity. They normally extend through one or more ARTCC areas and are designed to achieve balanced traffic  flows among high density terminals. IFR clearances are issued on the basis of these routes except when severe  weather avoidance procedures or other factors dictate otherwise. Preferred IFR Routes are listed in the Chart  Supplement U.S., and are also available at  https://www.fly.faa.gov/rmt/nf dc preferred routes database.jsp . If  a flight is planned to or from an area having such routes but the departure or arrival point is not listed in the Chart  Supplement U.S., pilots may use that part of a Preferred IFR Route which is appropriate for the departure or  arrival point that is listed. Preferred IFR Routes may be defined by DPs, SIDs, or STARs; NAVAIDs, Waypoints,  etc.; high or low altitude airways; or any combinations thereof. Because they often share elements with adapted  routes, pilots’ use of preferred IFR routes can minimize flight plan route amendments.

TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTION (TFR)− A TFR is a regulatory action issued by the FAA via the U.S.  NOTAM System, under the authority of United States Code, Title 49. TFRs are issued within the sovereign  airspace of the United States and its territories to restrict certain aircraft from operating within a defined area  on a temporary basis to protect persons or property in the air or on the ground. While not all inclusive, TFRs  may be issued for disaster or hazard situations such as: toxic gas leaks or spills, fumes from flammable agents,  aircraft accident/incident sites, aviation or ground resources engaged in wildfire suppression, or aircraft relief  activities following a disaster. TFRs may also be issued in support of VIP movements, for reasons of national  security; or when determined necessary for the management of air traffic in the vicinity of aerial demonstrations  or major sporting events. NAS users or other interested parties should contact a FSS for TFR information.  Additionally, TFR information can be found in automated briefings, NOTAM publications, and on the internet  at http://www.faa.gov. The FAA also distributes TFR information to aviation user groups for further  dissemination.  

TERMINAL AREA− A general term used to describe airspace in which approach control service or airport traffic  control service is provided.  

TERMINAL AREA FACILITY− A facility providing air traffic control service for arriving and departing IFR,  VFR, Special VFR, and on occasion en route aircraft.  (See APPROACH CONTROL FACILITY.)  (See TOWER.)  

TERMINAL AUTOMATION SYSTEMS (TAS)− TAS is used to identify the numerous automated tracking  systems including STARS and MEARTS.  

TERMINAL DATA LINK SYSTEM (TDLS)− A system that provides Digital Automatic Terminal Information  Service (D−ATIS) both on a specified radio frequency and also, for subscribers, in a text message via data link  to the cockpit or to a gate printer. TDLS also provides Pre−departure Clearances (PDC), at selected airports, to  subscribers, through a service provider, in text to the cockpit or to a gate printer. In addition, TDLS will emulate  the Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) information within the control tower.  

TERMINAL FLIGHT DATA MANAGER (TFDM)− An integrated tower flight data automation system to  provide improved airport surface and terminal airspace management. TFDM enhances traffic flow management  data integration with Time−Based Flow Management (TBFM) and Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS)  to enable airlines, controllers, and airports to share and exchange real−time data. This improves surface traffic  management and enhances capabilities of TFMS and TBFM. TFDM assists the Tower personnel with surface  Traffic Flow Management (TFM) and Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) and enables a fundamental change  in the Towers from a local airport−specific operation to a NAS−connected metering operation. The single  platform consolidates multiple Tower automation systems, including: Departure Spacing Program (DSP),  Airport Resource Management Tool (ARMT), Electronic Flight Strip Transfer System (EFSTS), and Surface  Movement Advisor (SMA). TFDM data, integrated with other FAA systems such as TBFM and TFMS, allows  airlines, controllers, and airports to manage the flow of aircraft more efficiently through all phases of flight from  departure to arrival gate.  

TERMINAL RADAR SERVICE AREA− Airspace surrounding designated airports wherein ATC provides  radar vectoring, sequencing, and separation on a full-time basis for all IFR and participating VFR aircraft. The  AIM contains an explanation of TRSA. TRSAs are depicted on VFR aeronautical charts. Pilot participation is  urged but is not mandatory.  

TERMINAL SEQUENCING AND SPACING (TSAS)− Extends scheduling and metering capabilities into the  terminal area and provides metering automation tools to terminal controllers and terminal traffic management  personnel. Those controllers and traffic management personnel become active participants in time−based  metering operations as they work to deliver aircraft accurately to Constraint Satisfaction Points within terminal  airspace to include the runway in accordance with scheduled times at those points. Terminal controllers are better  able to utilize efficient flight paths, such as Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) that require a  Navigational Specification (NavSpec) of RNP APCH with Radius−to−Fix (RF) legs, or Advanced RNP  (A−RNP), through tools that support the merging of mixed−equipage traffic flows. For example, merging aircraft  flying RNP APCH AR with RF, A−RNP, and non−RNP approach procedures. Additional fields in the flight plan  will identify those flights capable of flying the RNP APCH with RF or A−RNP procedures, and those flights  will be scheduled for those types of procedures when available. TSAS will schedule these and the non−RNP  aircraft to a common merge point. Terminal traffic management personnel have improved situation awareness  using displays that allow for the monitoring of terminal metering operations, similar to the displays used today  by center traffic management personnel to monitor en route metering operations.  

TERMINAL VFR RADAR SERVICE− A national program instituted to extend the terminal radar services  provided instrument flight rules (IFR) aircraft to visual flight rules (VFR) aircraft.

Basic radar service includes safety alerts, traffic advisories, limited radar vectoring when requested  by the pilot, and sequencing at locations where procedures have been established for this purpose and/or when  

covered by a letter of agreement. The purpose of this service is to adjust the flow of arriving IFR and VFR aircraft  into the traffic pattern in a safe and orderly manner and to provide traffic advisories to departing VFR aircraft.  b.  TRSA Service− This service provides, in addition to basic radar service, sequencing of all IFR and  participating VFR aircraft to the primary airport and separation between all participating VFR aircraft. The  purpose of this service is to provide separation between all participating VFR aircraft and all IFR aircraft  operating within the area defined as a TRSA.  c.  Class C Service− This service provides, in addition to basic radar service, approved separation between IFR  and VFR aircraft, and sequencing of VFR aircraft, and sequencing of VFR arrivals to the primary airport.  d.  Class B Service− This service provides, in addition to basic radar service, approved separation of aircraft  based on IFR, VFR, and/or weight, and sequencing of VFR arrivals to the primary airport(s).

Large consolidated FSS facilities may have many  tie-in facilities or FSS sectors within one facility.  

(See FLIGHT PLAN AREA.)  (See FLIGHT SERVICE STATION.)  

TIME−BASED FLOW MANAGEMENT (TBFM)− A foundational Decision Support Tool for time−based  management in the en route and terminal environments. TBFM’s core function is the ability to schedule aircraft  within a stream of traffic to reach a defined constraint point (e.g., meter fix/meter arc) at specified times, creating  a time−ordered sequence of traffic. The scheduled times allow for merging of traffic flows, efficiently utilizing  airport and airspace capacity while minimizing coordination and reducing the need for vectoring/holding. The  TBFM schedule is calculated using current aircraft estimated time of arrival at key defined constraint points  based on wind forecasts, aircraft flight plan, the desired separation at the constraint point and other parameters.  The schedule applies spacing only when needed to maintain the desired separation at one or more constraint  points. This includes, but is not limited to, Single Center Metering (SCM), Adjacent Center Metering (ACM),  En Route Departure Capability (EDC), Integrated Departure/Arrival Capability (IDAC), Ground−based Interval  Management−Spacing (GIM−S), Departure Scheduling, and Extended/Coupled Metering.  

TIME−BASED MANAGEMENT (TBM)− A methodology for managing the flow of air traffic through the  assignment of time at specific points for an aircraft. TBM applies time to manage and condition air traffic flows  to mitigate demand/capacity imbalances and enhance efficiency and predictability of the NAS. Where  implemented, TBM tools will be used to manage traffic even during periods when demand does not exceed  capacity. This will sustain operational predictability and assure the regional/national strategic plan is maintained.  TBM uses capabilities within TFMS, TBFM, and TFDM. These programs are designed to achieve a specified  interval between aircraft. Different types of programs accommodate different phases of flight.  

TIME GROUP− Four digits representing the hour and minutes from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)  clock. FAA uses UTC for all operations. The term “ZULU” may be used to denote UTC. The word “local” or  the time zone equivalent shall be used to denote local when local time is given during radio and telephone  communications. When written, a time zone designator is used to indicate local time; e.g., “0205M” (Mountain).  

The local time may be based on the 24-hour clock system. The day begins at 0000 and ends at 2359.  TIMELINE GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (TGUI)− A TBFM display that uses timelines to display the  Estimated Time of Arrival and Scheduled Time of Arrival of each aircraft to specified constraint points.

TIS−B service will be available  throughout the NAS where there are both adequate surveillance coverage (radar) and adequate broadcast  coverage from ADS−B ground stations. Loss of TIS−B will occur when an aircraft enters an area not covered  by the GBT network. If this occurs in an area with adequate surveillance coverage (radar), nearby aircraft that  remain within the adequate broadcast coverage (ADS−B) area will view the first aircraft. TIS−B may continue  when an aircraft enters an area with inadequate surveillance coverage (radar); nearby aircraft that remain within  the adequate broadcast coverage (ADS−B) area will not view the first aircraft.

It is based on the  sighting of either high intensity runway lights or on the visual contrast of other targets whichever yields the  greater visual range. RVR, in contrast to prevailing or runway visibility, is based on what a pilot in a moving  aircraft should see looking down the runway. RVR is horizontal visual range, not slant visual range. It is based  on the measurement of a transmissometer made near the touchdown point of the instrument runway and is  reported in hundreds of feet. RVR, where available, is used in lieu of prevailing visibility in determining  minimums for a particular runway.

VCOA procedures are developed to avoid obstacles greater than 3 statute miles from  the departure end of the runway as an alternative to complying with climb gradients greater than 200 feet per  nautical mile. Pilots are responsible to advise ATC as early as possible of the intent to fly the VCOA option prior  to departure. These textual procedures are published in the ‘Take−Off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure  Procedures’ section of the Terminal Procedures Publications and/or appear as an option on a Graphic ODP.  (See AIM.)  

VISUAL DESCENT POINT− A defined point on the final approach course of a nonprecision straight-in  approach procedure from which normal descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be  commenced, provided the approach threshold of that runway, or approach lights, or other markings identifiable  with the approach end of that runway are clearly visible to the pilot.  

VISUAL FLIGHT RULES− Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under visual conditions. The  term “VFR” is also used in the United States to indicate weather conditions that are equal to or greater than  minimum VFR requirements. In addition, it is used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of flight plan.  

(See INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES.)  (See INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.)  (See VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.)  (Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.)  (Refer to AIM.)  

VISUAL HOLDING− The holding of aircraft at selected, prominent geographical fixes which can be easily  recognized from the air.  (See HOLDING FIX.)  VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT (VLOS)− Condition of operations wherein the operator maintains continuous,  unaided visual contact with the unmanned aircraft.  VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS− Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of visibility,  distance from cloud, and ceiling equal to or better than specified minima.  (See INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES.)  (See INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.)  (See VISUAL FLIGHT RULES.)  VISUAL OBSERVER (VO)− A person who is designated by the remote pilot in command to assist the remote  pilot in command and the person operating the flight controls of the small UAS (sUAS) to see and avoid other  air traffic or objects aloft or on the ground.  VISUAL SEGMENT−  (See PUBLISHED INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE VISUAL SEGMENT.)  VISUAL SEPARATION− A means employed by ATC to separate aircraft in terminal areas and en route airspace  in the NAS. There are two ways to effect this separation:  a.  The tower controller sees the aircraft involved and issues instructions, as necessary, to ensure that the  aircraft avoid each other.  b.  A pilot sees the other aircraft involved and upon instructions from the controller provides his/her own  separation by maneuvering his/her aircraft as necessary to avoid it. This may involve following another aircraft  or keeping it in sight until it is no longer a factor.  (See SEE AND AVOID.)  (Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.)  VLF−  (See VERY LOW FREQUENCY.)  VMC−  (See VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.)  VOICE SWITCHING AND CONTROL SYSTEM (VSCS)− A computer controlled switching system that  provides air traffic controllers with all voice circuits (air to ground and ground to ground) necessary for air traffic  control.  (Refer to AIM.)  VOR− A ground-based electronic navigation aid transmitting very high frequency navigation signals, 360  degrees in azimuth, oriented from magnetic north. Used as the basis for navigation in the National Airspace  System. The VOR periodically identifies itself by Morse Code and may have an additional voice identification  feature. Voice features may be used by ATC or FSS for transmitting instructions/information to pilots.  (See NAVIGATIONAL AID.)  (Refer to AIM.)  VOR TEST SIGNAL−  (See VOT.)  VORTAC− A navigation aid providing VOR azimuth, TACAN azimuth, and TACAN distance measuring  equipment (DME) at one site.  (See DISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT.)  (See NAVIGATIONAL AID.)  (See TACAN.)  (See VOR.)  (Refer to AIM.)  

VORTICES− Circular patterns of air created by the movement of an airfoil through the air when generating lift.  As an airfoil moves through the atmosphere in sustained flight, an area of area of low pressure is created above  it. The air flowing from the high pressure area to the low pressure area around and about the tips of the airfoil  tends to roll up into two rapidly rotating vortices, cylindrical in shape. These vortices are the most predominant  parts of aircraft wake turbulence and their rotational force is dependent upon the wing loading, gross weight,  and speed of the generating aircraft. The vortices from medium to super aircraft can be of extremely high velocity  and hazardous to smaller aircraft.  

(See AIRCRAFT CLASSES.)  (See WAKE TURBULENCE.)  (Refer to AIM.)  VOT− A ground facility which emits a test signal to check VOR receiver accuracy. Some VOTs are available  to the user while airborne, and others are limited to ground use only.  (See CHART SUPPLEMENT.)  (Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.)  (Refer to AIM.)  VR−  (See VFR MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES.)  VSCS−  (See VOICE SWITCHING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.)  VTOL AIRCRAFT−  (See VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING AIRCRAFT.)

WAKE RE−CATEGORIZATION (RECAT)− A set of optimized wake separation standards, featuring an  increased number of aircraft wake categories, in use at select airports, which allows reduced wake intervals.  (See WAKE TURBULENCE.)  

WAKE TURBULENCE− A phenomenon that occurs when an aircraft develops lift and forms a pair of  counter−rotating vortices.  (See AIRCRAFT CLASSES.)  (See VORTICES.)  (Refer to AIM.)  WARNING AREA−  (See SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE.)  

WAYPOINT− A predetermined geographical position used for route/instrument approach definition, progress  reports, published VFR routes, visual reporting points or points for transitioning and/or circumnavigating  controlled and/or special use airspace, that is defined relative to a VORTAC station or in terms of  latitude/longitude coordinates.  

WEATHER ADVISORY− In aviation weather forecast practice, an expression of hazardous weather conditions  not predicted in the Aviation Surface Forecast, Aviation Cloud Forecast, or area forecast, as they affect the  operation of air traffic and as prepared by the NWS.  

(See AIRMET.)  (See GRAPHICAL AIRMEN’S METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION.)  (See SIGMET.)  

WEATHER RADAR PRECIPITATION INTENSITY− Existing radar systems cannot detect turbulence,  however, there is a direct correlation between turbulence intensity and precipitation intensity. Controllers must  issue all precipitation displayed on their user display systems. When precipitation intensity is not available,  controllers will report intensity as UNKNOWN. When precipitation intensity levels are available, they will be  described as follows:  

a.  LIGHT   $\big(<26~\mathrm{dBZ}\big)$    b.  MODERATE (26 to 40 dBZ)  c.  HEAVY   $\mathit{(>40}$   to 50 dBZ)  d.  EXTREME   $\mathrm{(>50\:dBZ)}$  

WEATHER RECONNAISSANCE AREA (WRA)− A WRA is airspace with defined dimensions and published  by Notice to Air Missions, which is established to support weather reconnaissance/research flights. Air traffic  control services are not provided within WRAs. Only participating weather reconnaissance/research aircraft  from the   $53^{\mathrm{rd}}$   Weather Reconnaissance Squadron and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Aircraft Operations Center are permitted to operate within a WRA. A WRA may only be established in airspace  within U.S. Flight Information Regions outside of U.S. territorial airspace.  

# WHEN ABLE−  

a.  In conjunction with ATC instructions, gives the pilot the latitude to delay compliance until a condition or  event has been reconciled. Unlike “pilot discretion,” when instructions are prefaced “when able,” the pilot is  expected to seek the first opportunity to comply.  

b.  In conjunction with a weather deviation clearance, requires the pilot to determine when he/she is clear of  weather, then execute ATC instructions.  

c.  Once a maneuver has been initiated, the pilot is expected to continue until the specifications of the  instructions have been met. “When able,” should not be used when expeditious compliance is required.  

WIDE-AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS)− The WAAS is a satellite navigation system consisting  of the equipment and software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The WAAS  provides enhanced integrity, accuracy, availability, and continuity over and above GPS SPS. The differential  correction function provides improved accuracy required for precision approach.  

WIDE AREA MULTILATERATION (WAM)– A distributed surveillance technology which may utilize any  combination of signals from Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS) (Modes A and C) and Mode  S transponders, and ADS-B transmissions. Multiple geographically dispersed ground sensors measure the  time-of-arrival of the transponder messages. Aircraft position is determined by joint processing of the  time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements computed between a reference and the ground stations’  measured time-of-arrival.  

WILCO−  I have received your message, understand it, and will comply with it.  

WIND GRID DISPLAY− A display that presents the latest forecasted wind data overlaid on a map of the ARTCC  area. Wind data is automatically entered and updated periodically by transmissions from the National Weather  Service. Winds at specific altitudes, along with temperatures and air pressure can be viewed.  

WIND SHEAR− A change in wind speed and/or wind direction in a short distance resulting in a tearing or  shearing effect. It can exist in a horizontal or vertical direction and occasionally in both.  

WIND SHEAR ESCAPE− An unplanned abortive maneuver initiated by the pilot in command (PIC) as a result  of onboard cockpit systems. Wind shear escapes are characterized by maximum thrust climbs in the low altitude  terminal environment until wind shear conditions are no longer detected.  

WING TIP VORTICES−  (See VORTICES.)
