# Why is fatigue so dangerous for  pilots in Alaska?

Alaska is known for its varied and rugged  landscape. Along with temperamental weather  and extremely long summer days, Alaskan aviation  represents some of the most difficult flying in the  U.S., if not the world.  

Research conducted by the Civil Aerospace  Medical Institute (CAMI) has shown that increasing  levels of fatigue can manifest in increased skill- based, decision-based, and perceptual errors.  Combined with the rugged conditions, fatigue puts  Alaskan pilots at even greater risk.

In another CAMI study, pilots 45-59 years of  age with a third-class medical certificate were at  significantly increased odds of having an accident  compared to other age groups. This same age  group tends to be at a higher risk of developing  obstructive sleep apnea, which can also contribute  significantly to pilot fatigue.  

# So how should Alaskan pilots  avoid fatigue-related errors?  

Pilots should strive for 8 hours of sleep per day,  even when itâ€™s still light outside, use caffeine  strategically to enhance performance, take short  10-to-20-minute naps before or after flights, and  discuss any sleep problems with a physician.
