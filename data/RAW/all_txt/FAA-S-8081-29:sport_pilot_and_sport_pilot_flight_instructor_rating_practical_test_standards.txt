# Introduction  

# General Information  

This PTS has been published by the FAA to establish the standards for the knowledge and skills  necessary for the issuance of a Sport Pilot Certificate, Flight Instructor Certificate with a Sport Pilot Rating,  Sport Pilot additional privileges to operate an additional category or class of light-sport aircraft and Flight  Instructor additional privileges seeking to provide training in an additional category or class of light-sport  aircraft at the sport pilot level.  

FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners, and flight instructors must conduct proficiency checks,  and practical tests in compliance with these standards. Flight instructors and applicants should find these  standards helpful during training and when preparing for the practical test or proficiency check.  

The FAA has developed this PTS as the standard that shall be used by FAA inspectors, SAEs, and  DPEs when conducting sport pilot and flight instructor with a sport pilot rating practical tests and by  Authorized Instructors when conducting proficiency checks.  

Throughout this PTS the following titles will be referred to as an evaluator: ASI, pilot examiner (other  than administrative pilot examiners), TCE, chief instructor, assistant chief instructor, check instructor of  a pilot school holding examining authority, or authorized instructor.  

A proficiency check is an evaluation of aeronautical knowledge and flight proficiency in accordance  with 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.321 or 61.419. A proficiency check must be administered using the  appropriate PTS for the category of aircraft when a pilot or a flight instructor adds new category/class  privileges. Upon successful completion of the proficiency  check the authorized instructor will endorse the  applicant’s logbook  indicating the added category/class of equipment that the applicant is authorized to  operate. When an evaluator conducts a proficiency check they are acting in the capacity of an authorized  instructor.  

DPEs and SAEs must have designation authority to conduct sport pilot initial evaluations SPE and  flight instructors with a sport pilot rating initial evaluations SFIE per FAA Order 8000.95, Designee  Management Policy.  

Information considered directive in nature is described in this PTS in terms such as “shall” and “must”  indicating the actions are mandatory. Guidance information is described in terms such as “should” and  “may” indicating the actions are desirable or permissive, but not mandatory.  

This PTS is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov  

Comments regarding this PTS may be emailed to  acsptsinquiries@faa.gov.  

# PTS Concept  

14 CFR part 61 specifies the subject areas in which knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the  applicant before the issuance of a certificate. The practical test standards contain the Areas of Operation  and specific Tasks in which competency shall be demonstrated. The FAA will revise this PTS whenever  it is determined that changes are needed in the interest of safety. Per 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43,  adherence to the practical test standards is mandatory.  

# PTS Description  

This PTS contains the following:  

Section 1—Sport Pilot Airplane Single-Engine Land and Sea  Section 2—Sport Pilot Gyroplane  Section 3—Sport Pilot Glider  Section 4—Sport Pilot Flight Instructor (The flight instructor section contains a separate introduction in  section 4.)  

This PTS includes the AREAS OF OPERATION and TASKs for the issuance of an initial Sport Pilot  Certificate and for the addition of sport pilot category/class privileges. It also contains information on how  to obtain an initial Flight Instructor Certificate with a sport pilot rating and for the addition of flight  instructor category/class privileges.  

AREAS OF OPERATION are phases of the practical test or proficiency check arranged in a logical  sequence within each standard. They begin with Preflight Preparation and end with Postflight  Procedures. The evaluator may conduct the practical test or proficiency check in any sequence that will  result in a complete and efficient test. An authorized instructor may conduct a proficiency check in any  sequence that will result in a complete and efficient test;  however, the ground portion  of the practical  test or proficiency check shall be accomplished before the flight portion.  

TASKs are specific knowledge areas, flight procedures, or maneuvers appropriate to an AREA OF  OPERATION. The abbreviation(s) within parentheses immediately following a TASK refer to the  appropriate class  of aircraft. The meaning of each class abbreviation is as follows:  

ASEL  Airplane Single-Engine—Land  ASES  Airplane Single-Engine—Sea  

When administering a test using section 1, 2, 3, or 4 of this PTS, the TASKs appropriate to the class  aircraft (ASEL and ASES) used for the test shall be included in the plan of action. The absence of a class  indicates the TASK is for all classes.  

NOTE is used to emphasize special considerations required in the AREA OF OPERATION or TASK.  

REFERENCE identifies the publication(s) that describe(s) the TASK. Descriptions of TASKs are not  included in these standards because this  information can be found in the current issue of the listed  reference. Publications other than those listed may be used for reference if their content conveys  substantially the same meaning as the referenced publications.

# Use of the PTS  

The FAA requires that all sport pilot and sport pilot flight instructor practical tests and proficiency checks  be conducted in accordance with the appropriate sport pilot practical test standards and the policies set  forth in this INTRODUCTION. Applicants must be evaluated in  ALL  TASKs included in each AREA OF  OPERATION of the appropriate practical test standard, unless otherwise noted.  

In preparation for each practical test or proficiency check, the evaluator or authorized instructor shall  develop a written “plan of action.” The “plan of action” shall include all TASKs in each AREA OF  OPERATION,  unless noted otherwise. If the elements in one TASK have already been evaluated in  another TASK, they need not be repeated.  

For example, the “plan of action” need not include evaluating the applicant on complying with markings  at the end of the flight, if that element was sufficiently observed at the beginning of the flight.  Any TASK  selected for evaluation during a practical test or proficiency check shall be evaluated in its  entirety.  Exception: the examiner or ASI (practical test); or Authorized Instructor (proficiency check)  evaluating single-seat applicants from the ground shall evaluate only those TASK  elements  that can be  accurately assessed from the ground.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor is not required to follow the precise order in which the AREAS OF  OPERATION and TASKs appear in these PTS. The evaluator or authorized instructor may change the  sequence or combine TASKs with similar Objectives to have an orderly and efficient flow of the practical  test or proficiency check events.  

The evaluator’s or authorized instructor’s “plan of action” shall include the order and combination of  TASKs to be demonstrated by the applicant in a manner that will result in an efficient and valid test.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor is expected to use good judgment in the performance of simulated  emergency procedures. The use of the safest means for simulation is expected. Consideration must be  given to local conditions, both meteorological and topographical, at the time  of the test, as well as the  applicant’s workload, and the condition of the aircraft used during the practical test or proficiency check.  

# If the procedure being evaluated would jeopardize safety, it is expected that the applicant will  simulate that portion of the maneuver.  

# Special Emphasis Areas  

Evaluators and authorized instructors shall place special emphasis upon areas of aircraft operations  considered critical to flight safety. Among these are:  

1. positive aircraft control;  2. procedures for positive exchange of flight controls;  3. stall and spin awareness (if appropriate);  4. collision avoidance;  5. wake turbulence and low level wind shear avoidance;  6. runway incursion avoidance;  7. CFIT;  8. ADM and risk management;  9. SRM and CRM;  10. wire strike avoidance;  11. checklist usage;   12. spatial disorientation;  13. TFR;  14. SUA;  15. aviation security; and  16. other areas deemed appropriate to any phase of the practical test or proficiency check.  

Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each TASK, they are essential to flight  safety and will be evaluated during the practical test or proficiency check. In all instances, the applicant’s  actions will be relate to the complete situation.  

# Sport Pilot—Practical Test Prerequisites (Initial)  

14 CFR part 61, sections 61.39 and subpart J provide practical test and certification prerequisites.  

# Sport Pilot—Additional Privileges  

If you hold a Sport Pilot Certificate or higher and seek to operate an additional category or class of light- sport aircraft you must comply with 14 CFR part 61,  section 61.321. If you hold a Flight Instructor  Certificate with a Sport Pilot Rating or higher and seek to operate an additional category or class of light- sport aircraft you must comply with 14 CFR part 61,  section 61.419.  

# Aircraft and Equipment Requirements  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.45 provides requirements for aircraft and equipment for the practical test.  

The aircraft utilized for sport pilot and sport pilot flight instructor practical tests and proficiency checks  must be a light-sport aircraft as defined in 14 CFR part 1.  

# Single-Seat Aircraft Practical Test  

Applicants for a Sport Pilot Certificate may elect to take their test in a single-seat aircraft. The FAA  established in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.45(f) specific requirements to allow a practical test for a Sport  Pilot Certificate only. This provision does not allow a practical test for a Flight   Instructor Certificate or  Recreation Pilot Certificate or higher to be conducted in a light-sport aircraft that has a single-pilot seat.  

With certain limitations, the practical test for a Sport Pilot Certificate may be conducted from the ground  by an examiner or ASI. The examiner or ASI must agree to conduct the practical test in a single-seat  aircraft and must ensure that the practical test is conducted in accordance with the sport pilot practical  test standards for single-seat aircraft.  Knowledge of all TASKs applicable to their category/class of  aircraft will be evaluated orally.  Single-seat sport pilots shall demonstrate competency in those specific  TASKs identified by a NOTE in the AREA OF OPERATION for  a single-seat practical test and any other  TASKs selected by the examiner or ASI. Examiners or ASIs evaluating single-seat applicants from the  ground shall evaluate only those TASK  elements  that can be accurately assessed from the ground.  

The examiner and ASI  must maintain radio contact  with the applicant and be  in a position to observe  the operation of the aircraft while evaluating the  proficiency of the applicant from the ground.  

Upon successful completion of the practical test, the pilot certificate will be issued with a limitation “No  passenger carriage and flight in a single-seat light-sport aircraft only.” Only an examiner or ASI is  authorized to remove this limitation when the sport pilot takes a complete practical test in a two-place  light-sport aircraft. This practical test may be conducted in the same or additional category of aircraft.  

# Single-Seat Aircraft Proficiency Check  

Sport pilot proficiency checks may be performed for an additional category/class privilege to a Sport Pilot  Certificate or higher, in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.321, using a single-seat light-sport  aircraft, provided the authorized instructor is an examiner. When an examiner conducts a proficiency  check they are acting in the capacity of an authorized instructor.  

The authorized instructor must agree to conduct the practical test in a single-seat light-sport aircraft and  must ensure that the proficiency  check is conducted in accordance with the sport pilot practical test  standards for single-seat aircraft. Knowledge of all TASKs applicable to the category or class of aircraft  will be evaluated orally. Those pilots seeking sport pilot privileges in a single-seat light-sport aircraft shall  demonstrate competency in those specific TASKs identified by a NOTE in the AREA OF OPERATION  for a single-seat proficiency check and any other TASKs selected by the authorized instructor. Authorized  instructors evaluating single-seat applicants from the ground shall evaluate only those TASK  elements  that can be accurately assessed from the ground.  

The authorized instructor must have radio contact and be in a position to observe the operation  of the light-sport aircraft and evaluate the proficiency of the applicant from the ground.  

On successful completion of a proficiency check, the authorized instructor will issue an endorsement with  the following limitation “No passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot seat aircraft only (add  category/class/make and model)” limiting their operations to a single-seat aircraft in this category, class,  make, and model. The authorized instructor must sign this endorsement with their flight instructor and  examiner number.  

This limitation can be removed by successfully completing a proficiency check, accomplishing the  additional TASKs identified in the practical test standards in a two-place light-sport aircraft in that specific  category and class, in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.321. This proficiency check must be  conducted in the same category and class of light-sport aircraft. Upon successful completion of the  proficiency check, the applicant will be given an endorsement for the aircraft privilege sought.  

# Evaluator Responsibility  

The evaluator conducting the practical test or authorized instructor conducting the proficiency check is  responsible for determining that the applicant meets the acceptable standards of knowledge and skill of  each TASK within each appropriate AREA OF OPERATION. Since there is no formal division between  the “oral” and “skill” portions of the practical test or proficiency check, this oral portion becomes an  ongoing process throughout the test. Oral questioning, to determine the applicant’s knowledge of TASKs  and related safety factors, should be used judiciously at all times, especially during the flight portion of  the practical test or proficiency check. Evaluators and authorized instructors  shall test to the greatest  extent practicable the applicant’s correlative abilities rather than mere rote enumeration of facts  throughout the practical test or proficiency check.  

If the evaluator or authorized instructor determines that a TASK is incomplete, or the outcome uncertain,  the evaluator may require the applicant to repeat that TASK, or portions of that TASK. This provision has  been made in the interest of fairness and does not mean that instruction, practice, or the repeating of an  unsatisfactory TASK is permitted during the certification process. When practical, the remaining  TASKs  of the practical test or proficiency check phase should be completed before repeating the questionable  TASK.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor shall use scenarios when applicable  to determine that the applicant  can use good risk management procedures in making aeronautical decisions. Examples of TASKs where  scenarios would be advantageous are weather analysis, performance planning, and runway/landing area  selection.  

Throughout the flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check, the evaluator or authorized  instructor shall evaluate the applicant’s knowledge and practical incorporation of special emphasis areas.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibility  

An appropriately rated authorized flight instructor is responsible for training the sport pilot applicant to  acceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in the Tasks within  the appropriate PTS.  

Because of the impact of their teaching activities in developing safe, proficient pilots, flight instructors  should exhibit a high level of knowledge, skill, and the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to  students. Additionally, the flight instructor must certify that the applicant is able to perform safely as a  sport pilot and is competent to pass the required practical test.  

Throughout the applicant's training, the flight instructor is responsible for emphasizing the performance  of effective visual scanning, collision avoidance, and runway incursion avoidance procedures. These  areas are covered, in part, in AC 90-48, Pilots’ Role in Collision Avoidance; FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge; and the Aeronautical Information Manual.  

# Practical Test—Sport Pilot—Satisfactory Performance  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(a), describes the satisfactory completion of the practical test for a  certificate or rating.  

# Practical Test—Sport Pilot-Unsatisfactory Performance  

If, in the judgment of the examiner, the applicant does not meet the standards of performance of any  Task performed, the associated Area of Operation is considered unsatisfactory and, therefore, the  practical test is failed. 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(c)-(f) provides additional unsatisfactory performance  requirements and parameters.  

Typical areas of unsatisfactory performance and grounds for disqualification are:  

1.  Any action or lack of action by the applicant that requires corrective intervention by the evaluator  to maintain safe flight.   2.  Failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques to clear the area before and while  performing maneuvers.   3.  Consistently exceeding tolerances stated in the Objectives.   4.  Failure to take prompt corrective action when tolerances are exceeded.  

When a disapproval notice is issued, the evaluator will record the applicant's unsatisfactory performance  in terms of Area of Operations and specific Task(s) not meeting the standard appropriate to the practical  test conducted. The Area(s) of Operation/Task(s) not tested and the number of practical test failures must  also be recorded. If the applicant fails the practical test because of a special emphasis area, the Notice  of Disapproval must indicate the associated Task.  

# Proficiency Check—Sport Pilot—Satisfactory Performance When Adding an Additional  Category/Class  

Satisfactory performance of TASKs to add category/class privileges is based on the applicant’s ability to  safely:  

1.  perform the TASKs specified in the AREAS OF OPERATION for  the certificate or privileges  sought within the approved standards;  2.  demonstrate mastery of the aircraft with the successful outcome  of each TASK performed never  seriously in doubt;  3.  demonstrate satisfactory proficiency and competency within the  approved standards;  4.  demonstrate sound judgment in aeronautical decision making/  risk management; and  5.  demonstrate single-pilot competence.  

When an applicant is adding a category/class privileges to their Pilot Certificate, the authorized instructor,  upon satisfactory completion of the proficiency check, shall endorse the applicant’s logbook  indicating that  the applicant is qualified to operate the additional sport pilot category/class of aircraft. The authorized  instructor shall forward FAA Form 8710-11, to Civil Aviation Registry within 10 days or submit the  application through IACRA.  

# Proficiency Check—Sport Pilot—Unsatisfactory Performance When Adding an Additional  Category/Class  

When the applicant’s performance does not meet the standards in the PTS, the evaluator or authorized  instructor conducting the proficiency check shall annotate the unsatisfactory performance on the FAA  Form 8710-11 and forward it to Civil Aviation Registry within 10 days or submit the application through  IACRA. A Notice of Disapproval will  NOT  be issued in this instance; rather, the applicant should be  provided with  a list of the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific TASKs not  meeting the standard, so  that the applicant may receive additional training.  

When the applicant receives the additional training in the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific  TASK(s) found deficient during the proficiency check, the recommending instructor shall endorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating that the applicant has received additional instruction and has been found  competent to pass the proficiency check. The applicant shall complete a new FAA Form 8710-11,  and   the recommending instructor shall endorse the application. The authorized instructor, other than the  one who provided the additional training, shall evaluate the applicant on all TASKS applicable to the  additional light-sport aircraft privilege sought. When the applicant successfully accomplishes a complete  proficiency check, the authorized instructor, shall forward the FAA Form 8710-11 to Civil Aviation  Registry within 10 days, or submit the application through IACRA, and endorse the applicant’s logbook  indicating the airman’s additional category/class privileges.  

# ADM, Risk Management, CRM, and SRM  

Throughout the practical test, the evaluator must assess the applicant’s ability to use sound aeronautical  decision-making procedures in order to identify hazards and mitigate risk. The evaluator must accomplish  this requirement by developing scenarios that incorporate and combine Tasks appropriate to assessing  the applicant’s risk management in making safe aeronautical decisions. For example, the evaluator may  develop a scenario that incorporates weather decisions and performance planning.  

In assessing the applicant’s performance, the evaluator should take note of the applicant’s use of CRM  and, if appropriate, SRM. CRM/SRM is the set of competencies that includes situational awareness,  communication skills, teamwork, task allocation, and decision-making within a comprehensive framework  of SOP. SRM specifically refers to the management of all resources onboard the aircraft, as well as  outside resources available to the single pilot. If an applicant fails to use ADM, including CRM/SRM, as   applicable in any Task, the evaluator will note that Task as failed.  

# Applicant’s Use of Checklists  

Throughout the practical test or proficiency check, the applicant is evaluated on the use of an appropriate  checklist. Proper use is dependent on the specific Task being evaluated. The situation may be such that  the use of the checklist while accomplishing the elements of the Objective would be either unsafe or  impractical, especially in a single-pilot operation. In this case, a review of the checklist after the elements  have been accomplished, would be appropriate. Division of attention and proper visual scanning would  be considered when using a checklist.  

# Use of Distractions During Practical Test or Proficiency Check  

Numerous studies indicate that many accidents have occurred when the pilot has been distracted during  critical phases of flight. To evaluate the pilot's ability to utilize proper control technique while dividing  attention both inside and outside the flight deck, the evaluator should simulate a realistic distraction during  the flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check to evaluate the applicant's ability to divide  attention while maintaining safe flight.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

During flight, there must always be a clear understanding between pilots of who has control of the aircraft.  Prior to flight, a briefing should be conducted that includes the procedure for the exchange of flight  controls. A positive three-step process, subsequently described, in the exchange of flight controls  between pilots is a proven procedure and one that is strongly recommended.  

When one pilot wishes to give the other pilot control of the aircraft, they will say, “You have the flight  controls.” The other pilot acknowledges immediately by saying, “I have the flight controls.” The first pilot  again says, “You have the flight controls.” When control is returned to the first pilot, follow the same  procedure. A visual check is recommended to verify that the exchange has occurred. There should never  be any doubt as to who is flying the aircraft.  

# Letter of Discontinuance  

When a practical test is discontinued for reasons other than unsatisfactory performance (e.g., equipment  failure, weather, or illness) FAA Form 8710-11, Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application, and, if  applicable, the AKTR, are to be returned to the applicant. The evaluator at that time prepares, signs, and  issues a Letter of Discontinuance to the applicant. The Letter of Discontinuance should identify the Areas  of Operation and their associated Tasks of the practical test that were successfully completed. The  applicant should be advised that the Letter of Discontinuance must be presented to the evaluator when  the practical test is resumed, and made part of the certification file.

# Flight Instructor Certificate with Sport Pilot Privileges  

# Flight Instructor Practical Test Section Description  

This section provides guidance and procedures for obtaining a Flight Instructor Certificate with a sport  pilot rating and for adding privileges to an existing Flight Instructor Certificate at the sport pilot level.  Information provided in the Introduction of this practical test standard also applies to this section.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor determines that the applicant   meets the TASK Objective through  the demonstration of competency in all elements of knowledge and/or skill unless otherwise noted. The  Objectives of TASKs in certain AREAS OF OPERATION, such as Fundamentals of Instructing and  Technical Subjects, include only knowledge elements. Objectives of TASKs in AREAS OF OPERATION  that include elements of skill, as well as knowledge, also include common errors, which the applicant  shall be able to describe, recognize,  analyze, and correct.  

Throughout this PTS the following titles: ASI, pilot examiner (other than administrative pilot examiners),  TCE, chief instructor, assistant chief instructor, check instructor of pilot school holding examining  authority, or authorized instructor (if applicable; e.g., proficiency check) will be referred to as an evaluator.  

At the flight instructor level, the Objective of a TASK that involves pilot skill consists of four parts. The  four parts include determination that   the applicant exhibits:  

1.  instructional knowledge of the elements of a TASK. This is accomplished through descriptions,  explanations, and simulated instruction.  2.  instructional knowledge of common errors related to a TASK, including their recognition, analysis,  and correction.  3.  the ability to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in  the standards at a more precise  level than that indicated in the sport pilot tolerances.  4.  the ability to analyze and correct common errors related to a TASK.  

# Use of the Flight Instructor Section  

The FAA requires that all flight instructor practical tests and proficiency checks be conducted in  accordance with the practical test standards. The flight instructor applicant must be prepared to  demonstrate the ability to instruct effectively in  ALL  TASKs included in the AREAS OF OPERATION  appropriate to the category/class unless otherwise noted.  

For the purposes of this flight instructor section, a proficiency check is an evaluation of aeronautical  knowledge and flight proficiency in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.419. A proficiency check  shall be administered using the appropriate PTS for the category of aircraft when a flight instructor adds  new category/class privileges. Upon successful completion of the proficiency check the authorized  instructor will endorse the applicant’s logbook indicating the added category/class of equipment that the  applicant is authorized to operate. When an evaluator conducts a proficiency check they are acting in the  capacity of an authorized instructor.  

All of the procedures and maneuvers to be tested are included in the sport pilot practical test standards.  The flight instructor section contains the AREAS OF OPERATION that are generic to all flight instructor  evaluations. Flight instructors must also be tested on TASKS located in the appropriate category/class  section the PTS. Those TASKs are listed in the evaluator’s practical test checklist and the instructor’s  proficiency check checklist. The mandatory TASKs are identified by a note located  in each area of  operation. In some cases specific TASKs are identified. In other cases the evaluator /instructor selects  one or more TASKs in an area of operation for evaluation. This allows for the practical test for  initial  certification and additional privileges to be completed within a reasonable time frame.  

The term “instructional knowledge” means the instructor applicant is capable of using the appropriate  reference to provide the "application or correlative level of knowledge" of a subject matter topic,  procedure, or maneuver. It also means that the flight instructor applicant’s discussions,  explanations, and  descriptions should follow the recommended teaching procedures and techniques explained in FAA-H- 8083-9, Aviation Instructor’s Handbook.  

In preparation for the practical test or proficiency check, the evaluator or authorized instructor shall  develop a written “plan of action.” The “plan of  action” for an initial certification test shall include the  required TASKs and one or more TASKs in the  Fundamentals of Instruction ,  Technical Subject Area,  and the  Preflight Lesson on a Maneuver to be Performed in Flight  AREAS OF OPERATION. Additionally,  the evaluator shall test the required TASK(s) listed in the evaluator’s practical test checklist, for the  appropriate category. The “plan of action” shall always include the required TASKs noted in each AREA  OF OPERATION.  Any TASK selected shall be evaluated in its entirety.  

If the applicant is unable to perform a TASK listed in the “plan of action” due to circumstances beyond  their control, the evaluator or authorized instructor may substitute another TASK from the applicable  AREA OF OPERATION.  

The “plan of action” used by an authorized instructor for a proficiency check administered for the addition  of an aircraft category and/or class privilege to a Flight Instructor Certificate shall include TASKs required  in the AREAS OF OPERATION as indicated in the instructor’s proficiency check checklist in this section.  

With the exception of the required TASKs, the evaluator or authorized instructor shall not tell the applicant  in advance which TASKs will be included in the “plan of action.” The applicant shall be prepared in  ALL  knowledge and skill areas included in the standards. Throughout the flight portion of the practical test or  proficiency check, the evaluator or authorized instructor shall evaluate the applicant’s ability to  simultaneously demonstrate and explain procedures and  maneuvers, and to give flight instruction to  learners at various stages of flight training and levels of experience.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor is expected to use good judgment in the performance of simulated  emergency procedures. The evaluator authorized instructor shall not simulate any condition that may  jeopardize safe flight or result in possible damage to the aircraft. The use of the safest means for  simulation is expected. Consideration must be given to local conditions, both meteorological and  topographical, at the time of the test, as well as the applicant’s workload and the condition of the aircraft  used. If the procedure being evaluated would jeopardize safety, it is expected that the applicant will  simulate that portion of the maneuver.  

# Special Emphasis Areas  

Evaluators or authorized instructors shall place special emphasis upon areas of aircraft operations  considered critical to flight safety. Among these are:  

1.  positive aircraft control;  2.  procedures for positive exchange of flight controls (who is flying the aircraft);  3.  stall and spin awareness (if appropriate);  4.  collision avoidance;  5.  wake turbulence and low level windshear avoidance;  6.  runway incursion avoidance;  7.  CFIT;  8.  ADM and risk management;  9.  checklist usage;  10.  spatial disorientation;  11.  TFR;  12.  SRM and CRM;  

13.  wire strike avoidance;  14.  SUA;  15.  LAHSO;  16.  aviation security; and  17.  other areas deemed appropriate to any phase of the practical test or proficiency check.  

The evaluator or authorized instructor shall place special emphasis on the applicant’s demonstrated  ability to teach precise aircraft control and sound judgment in aeronautical decision-making/risk  management. Evaluation of the applicant’s ability to teach judgment shall be accomplished by asking the  applicant to describe the presentation of practical problems that would be used in instructing learners in  the exercise of sound judgment. The evaluator or authorized instructor shall also emphasize the  evaluation of the applicant’s demonstrated ability to teach the special emphasis areas.  

Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each TASK, they are essential to flight  safety and will be evaluated during the practical test. In all instances, the applicant’s actions will be  evaluated in accordance to the standards of the TASKs and the ability to use good judgment reference  the special emphasis areas listed above.  

# Sport Pilot Flight Instructor Prerequisites—Initial  

14 CFR part 61, sections 61.39 and 61.403, provides for practical test and certification prerequisites.  

# Sport Pilot Flight Instructor Prerequisites—Additional Privileges  

A certificated flight instructor seeking privileges to provide flight training in an additional category/class of  light-sport aircraft must comply with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.419.  

# Evaluator Responsibility  

The evaluator conducting the practical test or the authorized instructor conducting the proficiency check  is responsible for determining that the applicant meets acceptable standards of teaching ability,  knowledge, and skill in the selected TASKs. The evaluator or authorized instructor makes this  determination when the applicant has successfully accomplished an Objective that is appropriate to  each selected TASK, and includes an evaluation of the applicant’s:  

1.  ability to apply the fundamentals of instructing;  2.  knowledge of, and ability to teach, the subject matter, procedures, and maneuvers covered in the  TASKs;  3.  ability to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the standards at a more precise level  than that indicated in the sport pilot tolerances; and  4.  ability to describe, recognize, analyze, and correct common  errors related to the skill procedures  and maneuvers covered in the TASKs.  

It is intended that oral questioning be used at any time during the ground or flight portion of the practical  test or proficiency check to determine  that the applicant can instruct effectively and has a comprehensive  knowledge of the TASKs and their related safety factors.  

During the flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check, the evaluator or authorized instructor  shall act as a learner during selected maneuvers. This will give the evaluator or authorized instructor  an opportunity to evaluate the flight instructor applicant’s ability to analyze and correct simulated  common errors related to these maneuvers. The evaluator or authorized instructor will place special  emphasis on the applicant’s use of visual scanning and collision avoidance procedures, and the  applicant’s ability to teach those procedures.  

Evaluators or authorized instructors should, to the greatest extent possible, test the applicant’s  application and correlation skills. When possible, scenario based questions should be used during the  practical test or proficiency check.  

If the evaluator or authorized instructor determines that a TASK is incomplete, or the outcome uncertain,  the evaluator or authorized instructor, may require the applicant to repeat that TASK, or portions of that  TASK. This provision has been made in the interest of fairness and does not mean that instruction,  practice or the repeating of an unsatisfactory TASK is permitted during the certification process. When  practical, the remaining TASKs of the practical test or proficiency check phase should be completed  before repeating the questionable TASK.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibility  

An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for training the flight instructor applicant to  acceptable standards in  ALL  subject matter areas,   procedures, and maneuvers included in the TASKs  within each AREA OF OPERATION in the appropriate category/class in this practical test standard. In  addition, the rated flight instructor is required to prepare the flight instructor applicant in all TASKs in the  AREAS OF OPERATION listed in section 4.  

Because of the impact of their teaching activities in developing safe, proficient pilots, flight instructors  should exhibit a high level of knowledge, skill, and the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to  learners. The flight instructor must certify that the applicant is:  

1.  able to make a practical application of the fundamentals of instructing;  2.  competent to teach the subject matter, procedures, and maneuvers included in the standards to  learners with varying backgrounds and levels of experience and ability;  3.  able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the standards at a more precise level  than that required at the sport pilot level; and  4.  competent to pass the required practical test for the issuance of the Flight Instructor Certificate— Sport Pilot with the associated category/class privilege or the addition of a category/class  privileges at the Flight Instructor Certificate.  

Throughout the flight instructor applicant’s training, the flight instructor is responsible for emphasizing the  performance of and the ability to teach effective visual scanning, runway incursion avoidance, and  collision avoidance procedures. The flight instructor applicant should develop and use scenario based  teaching methods particularly on special emphasis areas. These areas are covered in AC 90-48,  Pilot's Role in Collision Avoidance; FAA-H-8083-3, Airplane Flying Handbook; FAA- H-8083-11, Balloon  Flying Handbook; FAA-H-8083-13, Glider Flying Handbook; FAA-H-8083-21, Rotorcraft Flying  Handbook; FAA- H-8083-23, Seaplane, Skiplane and Float/Ski Equipped Helicopter Handbook; FAA-H- 8083-25, Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge;  and the current Aeronautical Information Manual.  

# Initial Flight Instructor Certification Practical Test—Satisfactory Performance  

An applicant who seeks initial flight instructor certification will be evaluated in all AREAS OF OPERATION  of the standards appropriate to the category/class rating(s) sought. The evaluator shall refer to the  evaluator’s practical test checklist, for the appropriate category, located in this section, to determine the  TASKs to be tested, in each AREA OF OPERATION. 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(a), describes the  satisfactory completion of the practical test for a certificate or rating.  

# Initial Flight Instructor Certification Practical Test—Unsatisfactory Performance  

If, in the judgment of the evaluator, the applicant does not meet the standards of performance of any  TASK performed, the applicable AREA OF OPERATION is considered unsatisfactory and therefore, the  practical test is failed. 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(c) – (f) provides additional unsatisfactory  performance requirements and parameters. The evaluator or applicant may discontinue the test at any  time when the failure of an AREA OF OPERATION makes the applicant ineligible for the certificate  sought.  The test will be continued only with the consent of the applicant.  

If the test is discontinued, the applicant is entitled credit for only those AREAS OF OPERATION and their  associated TASKs satisfactorily performed. However, during the retest and at the discretion of the  evaluator, any TASK may be re-evaluated, including those previously considered satisfactory.  

# Typical reasons for disqualification are:  

1.  failure to perform a procedure or maneuver at a more precise level than that indicated in the sport  pilot tolerances while giving  effective flight instruction;  2.  failure to provide an effective instructional explanation while demonstrating a procedure or  maneuver (explanation during the  demonstration must be clear, concise, technically accurate, and  complete with no prompting from the evaluator);  3.  any action or lack of action by the applicant which requires corrective intervention by the evaluator  to maintain safe flight; or  4.  failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques to clear the area before and while  performing maneuvers.  

When a Disapproval Notice is issued, the evaluator shall record the applicant’s unsatisfactory  performance in terms of AREA(s) OF OPERATION and specific TASK(s) not meeting the standard  appropriate to the practical test conducted. If the applicant fails the practical test because of a special  emphasis area, the Notice of Disapproval shall indicate the associated TASK. An example would be:  AREA OF OPERATION III, Traffic Patterns, failure to teach proper  collision avoidance procedures.  

# Proficiency Check—Satisfactory Performance When Adding an Additional Category/Class  Privilege  

The authorized instructor shall refer to the instructor’s proficiency check checklist, for the appropriate  category, located in this section, to determine the TASKs to be tested, in each AREA OF OPERATION.  The proficiency check is passed if, in the judgment of the authorized instructor, the applicant  demonstrates satisfactory performance with regard to the required tasks in the required Areas of  Operation.  

When an applicant is adding a category/class privileges to their Flight Instructor Certificate, the evaluating  authorized instructor shall, upon successful completion of the proficiency check, endorse the applicant’s  logbook indicating that the applicant is qualified to instruct in an additional sport pilot category/class of  aircraft. The authorized instructor shall forward FAA Form 8710-11 to Civil Aviation Registry within 10  days or submit the application through IACRA.  

# Proficiency Check—Unsatisfactory Performance When Adding an Additional Category/Class  Privilege  

When the applicant’s performance does not meet the standard in the PTS, the authorized instructor  conducting the proficiency check shall annotate the unsatisfactory performance on the FAA Form 8710- 11 and forward it to Civil Aviation Registry within 10 days or submit the application through IACRA. A  Notice of Disapproval will  NOT  be issued in this instance; rather, the applicant should be provided with a  list of the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific TASKs not meeting the standard, so that the  applicant may receive additional training.  

1.  failure to perform a procedure or maneuver at a more precise level than that indicated in the sport  

pilot tolerances while giving  effective flight instruction;  2.  failure to provide an effective instructional explanation while demonstrating a procedure or  maneuver (explanation during the  demonstration must be clear, concise, technically accurate, and  complete with no prompting from the authorized instructor);  3.  any action or lack of action by the applicant which requires corrective intervention by the evaluator  to maintain safe flight; or  4.  failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques to clear the area before and while  performing maneuvers.  

When the applicant receives the additional training in the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific  TASK(s) found deficient during the proficiency check, the recommending instructor shall endorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating that the applicant has received additional instruction and has been found  competent to pass the proficiency check.  The applicant shall complete a new FAA Form 8710-11, and  the recommending instructor shall endorse the application. The authorized instructor, other than the one  who provided the additional training, shall evaluate the applicant. When the applicant successfully  accomplishes a complete proficiency check, the authorized instructor, shall forward the FAA Form 8710- 11 to Civil Aviation Registry within 10 days, or submit the application through IACRA, and endorse the  applicant’s logbook  indicating the airman’s additional privileges.
