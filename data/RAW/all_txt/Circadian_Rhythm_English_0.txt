# Tips to Help Minimize Jet Lag  

Adjust your bedtime by an hour a day a few days
			 before your trip. This will adjust your sleep pattern
			 to match the sleep schedule you will keep at
			 your destination  

Reset your watch to the destination time at the
			 beginning of your flight to help you adjust more
			 quickly to the time zone you will be visiting  

Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your
			 flight. The air you breathe on airplanes is extremely
			 dry, and some experts believe that dehydration is a
			 predisposing cause of jet lag. Virtually everyone
			 agrees that dehydration can make jet lag worse  

Eat lightly but strategically. What you eat can have a
			 direct influence on your wake/sleep cycle. Remember
			 that high-protein meals are likely to keep you awake, 
			 while foods high in carbohydrates can promote sleep, 
			 and fatty foods may make you feel sluggish  

Relax on the first day at your destination. If you have
			 the luxury of arriving at your destination a day or two
			 before you have to engage in important activities that
			 require a lot of energy or sharp intellectual focus, give
			 yourself a break and let your body adjust to the time
			 change a little more gradually  

# As a Passenger:  

m	 Avoid drinking alcohol or anything with caffeine
					 in it during your flight (includes many soft
					 drinks, coffee, and tea.) Both alcohol and
					 caffeine increase dehydration m	 Sleep on the plane if it is nighttime at your
					 destination. Use earplugs, headphones, eye
					 masks, or other sleep aids to help block out
					 noise and light, and a travel pillow to make you
					 more comfortable so you can sleep m	 Stay awake during your flight if it is daytime at
					 your destination. Read, talk with other
					 passengers, watch the movie, or walk the aisles
					 to avoid sleeping at the wrong time  

# CRD Affects Your Flying Skills  

CRD-induced fatigue that goes untreated or ignored will have  both physiological and psychological ramifications that not  only can jeopardize your personal health but can also become  a safety-of-flight issue. A few of the more well known  undesired personal affects are:  

# 1.	Increased reaction time  

•	 Impaired responses in sequential tasks that require
			 time synchronization		 •	 Need to increase the magnitude of sensory
			 stimulation to elicit response  

# 2. 	 Decreased attention  

•	 Omission or displacement of individual elements in
			 sequential task		 •	 Channelized attention to one task at the expense
			 of other		 •	 Impaired visual monitoring patterns		 •	 Difficulty in self-identifying performance impairment  

•	 Difficulty remembering recent events during flight		 •	 Tendency to forget secondary tasks  

# 4.	Personal conduct of isolation  

•	 Tendency to avoid interpersonal interactions		 •	 Tendency to avoid tasks that require low workload		 •	 Increase distraction due to discomfort		 •	 Emotional irritability		 •	 Indifference  

# Consequences of CRD on the   Flight Environment  

•	 Increased frequency and severity of piloting errors
		 during aircraft operations	 •	 Increased frequency of operational incidents	 •	 Increased risk in aviation operations  

# Resetting Your Biological Clock   and Recovering  

Once you have fallen victim to CRD, it is imperative to reset  your biological clock. Here’s how:  

•  Catch Some Rays.  Exposing yourself to as much
			 daylight as possible might also be a good idea, because
			 it has been scientifically shown that bright light helps
			 reset circadian rhythms. In addition to resetting the
			 clock, light has a direct and positive affect by increasing
			 brain serotonin levels. At the same time, circadian light
			 therapy has a depressing affect on daytime melatonin, a
			 clear link to depression and sleep disorders		 •  Be Active.  When you arrive, taking a nap is the worst
			 thing you can do because it sets your body’s rhythms
			 back to home time. Staying active on arrival will help
			 the body adjust to the new time zone. Eating and
			 sleeping are your body’s time indicators, so it’s
			 important to fit in with what the locals are doing
			 when you arrive. Consequently, if it’s breakfast time, 
			 eat breakfast  

# Coping With CRD While On Duty  

• Sleep well at home before any flight	 • Try to get at least as much sleep per 24 hours as you
		 would normally at home	 • If you are sleepy, try to sleep. Employ strategic (combat)
		 napping techniques 1. Whenever possible, take a 30-minute nap prior to a long flight 2. Avoid naps of more than 30 minutes, as they involve deep sleep 3. Taking a nap is better than not sleeping at all • Avoid pilot adaptation to a local circadian rhythm following transmeridian flights with short layovers • Try to maintain the circadian rhythm from your place of origin, and at the same, time try to sleep longer • Use caffeine strategically during the flight to counteract
 circadian rhythm sleepiness •	 While in the cockpit seat, converse with others, stretch your legs, and take regular breaks •	 Try to avoid night flights following a transmeridian flight •	 Transmeridian flights should be alternated with
 intrameridian flights, enabling you to return to your normal circadian rhythm  

Remember, circadian rhythm disruption can lead to acute or  chronic fatigue. Fatigue in the cockpit has shown to be just  as debilitating as drugs and alcohol. Do not let CRD-induced  fatigue become a hindrance to aviation safety.

# Circadian Rhythm   Disruptionand Aviation  

# I t’s All About the Rhythm and Blues  

Our body’s biological functions work much like a finely  tuned watch: Every part works in unison to keep the body in  homeostasis (maintenance of the internal environment within  tolerable limits). However, when one working part doesn’t  function normally, it tends to disrupt many other vital parts  and can upset homeostasis.  

Often, we bring disruptions on ourselves with such things as  self-imposed stress, and then we must try to get everything  back to normal.  

Managing your circadian rhythm is no different. It must be  maintained to operate within normal working parameters,  or a variety of negative effects will occur, and some of these  could become a safety-of-flight issue.  

# An Internal Biological Clock  

Our circadian rhythm  is best described as  an internal biological  clock that regulates  our body functions,  based on our wake/ sleep cycle. Circadian  rhythms are not  only important in  determining sleep  cycles but also in  feeding patterns.  There are clear  

![](images/daedbac651453ac9d9f0163cc75a218ddd4bfba9188dec00bcefc37306a19fa0.jpg)  

patterns of brain wave activity, hormone production, cell  regeneration, and other biological activities linked to these  daily cycles.  

# Origin  

Circadian rhythms are believed to have originated in the  earliest cells, with the purpose of protecting replicating DNA  from high ultraviolet radiation during the daytime. As a result,  replication was relegated to the dark, and a basic pattern of  

day/night cycle was  engrained within  the cell and passed  down to subsequent  generations. At some  time in the distant  past, the days may  have been longer,  because when we  are deprived of time  clues, we gravitate  toward a 25-hour  circadian cycle.

# The Internal Works of Our Biological Watch  

In your brain, there is a type of “pacemaker” located within  the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This area regulates the firing  of nerve cells that seem to control your circadian rhythm.  Scientists can’t explain precisely how this area in your brain  “keeps time.” They do know your brain relies on “outside”  influences called zeitgebers (German for time givers) to keep  it on a normal schedule.  

The most obvious zeitgeber is daylight. When daylight  hits your eyes, cells in the retinas signal your brain. Other  zeitgebers are ambient temperature, sleep, social contact,  physical activity, and even regular meal times. They all  send “timekeeping” clues to your brain, helping keep your  circadian rhythm running on schedule.  

# Circadian Rhythm Disruption  

Any time that our normal 25-hour circadian rhythm is altered  or interrupted, it will have physiological and behavioral  impacts. This is better known as circadian rhythm disruption,  or CRD. Normal circadian rhythms are naturally altered as  one ages including changes in sleep pattern with respect to  earlier onset of sleepiness, early-morning awakenings, and  increased need for daytime napping.

# Sleep Disorders and CRD  

Several chronic sleep disorders can lead or contribute to  circadian rhythm disruptions, including:  

•  Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.  This disorder causes  a delay in the normal sleep onset time by two or more  hours. People affected by this disorder complain of  late-evening insomnia and/or excessive early-morning  sleepiness, have difficulties falling asleep before 2:00  a.m., have short sleep periods during weekdays,  and prolonged (9-12 hours) sleep periods during  the weekends. These individuals tend to experience  depression and other psychiatric disorders •  Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome.  This is a disorder  where sleepiness occurs well before the desired sleep  schedule. The resulting symptoms include evening  sleepiness, an early sleep onset, and an morning  awakening that is earlier than desired. A person feels  

the urge to go to sleep between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m. and  wakes up between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m. the following  morning. This disorder can have a negative impact on an  individual’s personal or social life because of the need  to leave early-evening social activities to sleep. Evening  sleepiness may also represent a driving hazard  

•  Non 24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder.  This disorder is  the result of an inadvertent delay of the sleep onset  time, followed by unsuccessful attempts to sleep at the  desired sleep schedule. People affected by this disorder  constantly delay sleep onset times that interfere with  circadian rhythms. They have a normal sleep duration  pattern but live  

![](images/6cec0dafa4133a4506b166bda6a30257f11239e4e893ec306526a5f5add426cf.jpg)  

in a free-running  “biological clock” of  25 hours instead of the  community-accepted  24-hour clock. The  sleep cycle is affected  by inconsistent  insomnia that occurs  at different times.  Those affected will  sometimes fall asleep  at a later time and  wake up later; or fall  asleep at an earlier  time and wake up  earlier  

Even if you do not have a chronic sleep disorder, there are  several measures that can help you get a good night’s sleep.  Among these are:  

•  Mental or physical relaxation techniques (reading,  meditation, yoga) •  If you don’t fall a sleep within 30 minutes of going to  bed, get out of bed and try an activity that helps induce  sleep such as reading, listening to relaxing music,  watching something boring on TV, etc. •  Ensure you are in an environment conducive to sleeping  (dark, quiet, comfortable temperature and mattress) •  Exercise regularly, but not too near bedtime •  A nutritious, balanced diet  

# Shift Work and CRD  

Shift work almost always causes a circadian rhythm  disruption—the internal body clock is at odds with the shift  schedule. Shift-work problems are well documented, ranging  from performance issues to accidents and health problems.  

# Recognizing Circadian Rhythm Disruption  

Pilots or passengers who are suffering from CRD may  experience one or more of the following symptoms:  •  Difficulty falling and staying asleep, late-night insomnia  

•  Increased daytime sleepiness •  A general lack of energy in the morning •  An increase of energy in the evening or late at night •  Difficulty concentrating, being alert, or accomplishing     
  mental tasks •  Oversleeping and trouble getting up •  Increased negative moods  

The most debilitating symptom of CRD is, of course, fatigue.  Fatigue is typically characterized by:  

•  General discomfort •  Sleepiness •  Irritability •  Apathy or loss of interest •  Decreased concentration •  Loss of appetite •  Impaired sensory perceptions •  Mood changes •  Impaired decision-making  

Fatigue, itself, is a very dangerous condition for any pilot  attempting to operate an aircraft. Realizing the cause of the  fatigue (in this case, CRD) is the first and most important step  in treating it.  

# Jet Lag is a CRD!  

Of all the stressors in aviation,  jet lag , or  rapid time zone  change syndrome,  seems to have the biggest impact. This  syndrome consists of symptoms that include excessive  sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who  travel across time zones.  Other Symptoms:  Fatigue, insomnia, disorientation,  headaches, digestive problems, lightheadedness. Jet lag is more evident if you fly from west to east because it  is more difficult for your body to adjust to “losing time” when  you journey east than to “gaining time,” when you fly from  east to west.
