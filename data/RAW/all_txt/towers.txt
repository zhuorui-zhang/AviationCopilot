The dull color and small footprint can make these uncharted towers difficulttosee.Inaddition,they can be erected in hours,making these vertical obstacles a majorsafety risk to helicopter emergency medical evacuation services,aerial applicators,lawenforcement,aerial firefighting,predatorcontrol,pipelinepatrols,aeria wildlifesurveys,military operations,andothers  

The numberof meteorological, cell phone,wind energy,and other towers erected in agricultural regions throughout the United States has increased significantly during the past several years.

# Four Safety Tips Help You Avoid Meteorological Towers  

# 1. Towers can be erected in hours!  

Agoperators and pipeline flyers returning to a field after a few days or a few hours may find a tower that wasn'tthereearlier.  

# 2. Towers may have a small footprint!  

Thesmall sizemay leave little ground disturbance (footprint)to indicate the tower'spresence.Attimes however,the footprint maybe easier to spot than the toweritself!  

# 3. The tower cofor may be difficult to see!  

Many towers are just under 200 feet tall, dull gray, and unlit, and they do not have markers to note any support cables. Check the Internet to see if your state maintains a tower registry, and checkyour route as part of the pre flight  

# 4. Ferry above 5 and stay alive!
