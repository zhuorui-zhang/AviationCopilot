In addition to the medications on the Do Not  Issue list, pilots should not fly while using any of the  medications or classes/groups of medications listed below  without an acceptable wait time after the last dose. These  medications may cause sedation (drowsiness) or impair  cognitive function, seriously degrading pilot performance.  This impairment can occur even when the individual  feels alert and is apparently functioning normally - in  other words, the pilot can be “unaware of impair.”  

•	 Allergy medications

 	 •	 Muscle relaxants

 	 •	 OTC dietary supplements

 	 •	 Pain medications

 	 •	 Pre-medication or Pre-procedure drugs

 	 •	 Sleep aids

 	 •	 Any medication, prescription or Over the Counter 

 	 	 (OTC) that carries a label precaution or warning 

 	 	 that it may cause drowsiness or advises the user 

 	 	 “be careful when driving a motor vehicle or 

 	 	 operating machinery.”  

For aviation safety, airmen should not fly following the  last dose of any of the medications above until a period of  time has elapsed equal to:  

5-times the maximal  pharmacologic half-life of the  medication; or 5-times the  maximal hour dose interval  if pharmacologic half-life  information is not available.  For example, there is a 30-hour  wait time for a medication that  is taken every 4 to 6 hours  (5 times 6).  

# Side effect concerns of frequently  used OTC medications  

If you must take over-the-counter medications,

 •	 Read and follow the label directions.

 •	 If the label warns of significant side effects, do not  fly after taking the medication until at least five  maximal dosing intervals have passed.

 •	 Remember that you should not fly if the  underlying condition that you are treating would  make you unsafe if the medication fails to work.

 •	 Never fly after taking a new medication for the  first time until  at least  48 hours have passed and  no side effects are noted.

 •	 As with alcohol, medications may impair your  ability to fly—even though you feel fine.

 •	 If you have questions about a medication, ask a  healthcare provider.

 •	 When in doubt, safety first—don’t fly.

Medications and Flying

# Does this story sound familiar?  

It’s Sunday morning, the last day of a three-day trip. You  have four hours of flying ahead of you to get back home,  but something about the air conditioner last night has  left you with a stuffy nose and sinuses this morning. You  know from your training and experience that flying with  congested upper airways is not a good thing. As it turns out,  one of the others on the trip has some new over-the-counter  

sinus pills that  are “guaranteed”  to unstop your  breathing passages  and let you fly  without any  worries about  the congestion.  Should you take the  medication?

# Another scenario  

You and your spouse are on the second leg of a five-leg,  cross-country flight. While visiting relatives, you stayed up  late at the party they threw in your honor, ate too much,  

and the next morning  your stomach feels sort  of queasy. Your spouse,  a non-pilot, offers you  a common motion- sickness pill prescribed  by her doctor.  Should you take the  medication?

# Get the facts  

Just like any other decision (equipment, weather, etc.)  that you must make when you fly, you should know the  facts before you can answer this question. There are several  things that you need to know and take into account before  you make the go/no-go decision. Add these to your check  list:  

First,  consider the underlying condition that you are  treating.  What will be the consequences if the medication  doesn’t work or if it wears off before the flight is over? A  good general rule to follow is not to fly if you must depend  on the medication to keep the flight safe. In other words,  if the untreated condition is one that would prevent safe  flying, then you shouldn’t fly until the condition improves  – whether you take the medication or not.  

Second, you must  consider your reaction to the  medication.  There are two broad categories of medication  reactions. One is a unique reaction based on an individual’s  biological make-up. Most people don’t have such reactions  but anyone can, given the right medication. Because of  this, you should NEVER fly after taking any medication  that you have not taken before. It is not until after you  have taken the medication that you will find out whether  you have this uncommon and unexpected reaction to the  medication.

Third,  consider the potential for adverse reactions,  or  side effects – unwanted reactions to medications. This type  of reaction is quite common, and the manufacturer of the  medication lists these on the label. You MUST carefully  read all labeling. If you don’t have access to the label, then  don’t fly while using the medication.  

AMEs should not issue medical certificates to  applicants who are using these medication classes:  

• 	Angina medications •	 Anti choline rg ics (oral) •	 Cancer treatments  •	 Controlled Substances (Schedules I – V This includes  	 medical marijuana, even if legally allowed or prescribed  	 under state law) •	 Selected Diabetic medications •	 Dopamine agonists •	 Hypertensive (centrally acting such as clonidine) •	 Selected Psychiatric or Psychotropic medications •	 Malaria medication •	 Over-Active-Bladder (OAB) medications •	 Other: Selected medications with less than 12 month  	 FDA approvals •	 Seizure medications •	 Smoking cessation aids  •	 Steroids (high does) •	 Weight loss medications  

Look for such key words as  lightheadedness ,  dizziness ,  drowsiness , or  visual disturbance . If these side effects are  listed or if the label contains  any  warning about operating  motor vehicles or machinery, then you  should not  fly while  using the medication.  

Side effects can occur at any time, so even if you’ve taken  the same medication in the past without experiencing side  effects, they could still occur the next time. For this reason,  you must never fly after taking a medication with any of the  above-noted side effects.
