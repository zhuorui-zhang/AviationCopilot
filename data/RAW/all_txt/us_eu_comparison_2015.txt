# 2015 Comparison of ATM-related performance:  U.S. – Europe  

August 2016  

# ABSTRACT  

This report is the 5th in a series of joint ATM operational performance comparisons between the US and  Europe. It represents the   $2^{\mathfrak{n d}}$   edition under the Memorandum of Cooperation between the United States  and the European Union. Building on established operational key performance indicators, the goal of  the joint study conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and EUROCONTROL on behalf of  the European Union is to understand differences between the two ATM systems in order to further  optimise ATM performance and to identify best practices for the benefit of the overall air transport  system. The analysis is based on a comparable set of data and harmonised assessment techniques for  developing reference conditions for assessing ATM performance.

This report is the 5th in a series of joint ATM operational performance comparisons between the  US and Europe. It represents the 2nd edition under the Memorandum of Cooperation between  the United States and the European Union. The report provides a comparative operational  performance assessment between Europe and the US using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  that have been harmonized by both groups. The report provides demonstrated examples of the  KPIs listed in the 2016 ICAO Global Air Navigation Plan (GANP) which can be used to assess the  benefits of the global implementation of Aviation System Block Upgrades (ASBUs).  

The indicators used are those proven to meet key ANSP objectives of identifying system  constraints through delay/capacity measures and improving flight efficiency by measuring actual  trajectories against an ideal. The report also includes punctuality and block time indicators that  relate performance more directly to the airline/passenger perspective.  Complementary to the  well-established indicators already used in previous versions of the comparison reports, this  edition also features two supporting studies on 1) Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management  (ATFCM) and 2) Vertical Flight Efficiency in the arrival phase.  

The first part of this report examines commonalities and differences in terms of air traffic  management and performance influencing factors, such as air traffic demand characteristics and  weather, which can have a large influence on the observed performance.  

Overall, air navigation service provision is more fragmented in Europe with more ANSPs and  physical facilities than in the US. The European area comprises 37 Air Navigation Service  Providers (ANSPs) with 62 en-route centres and 16 stand-alone Approach Control (APP) units  (total: 78 facilities). The US CONUS has 20 en-route centres supplemented by 26 stand-alone  Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) units (total: 46 facilities), operated by one ANSP.  

Although the US CONUS airspace is   $10\%$   smaller than the European airspace, the US controlled  approximately   $57\%$   more flights operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) with   $24\%$   fewer  full time Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) than in Europe in 2015. US airspace density is, on  average, higher and airports tend to be notably larger than in Europe.  

In terms of traffic evolution, there was a notable decoupling between the US and Europe in 2004  when the traffic in Europe continued to grow while US traffic started to decline. The effect of the  economic crisis starting in 2008 impacted traffic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. While  traffic in Europe decreased by   $3.3\%,$  , air traffic in the US decreased by   $9.9\%$   between 2008 and  2015.  

The second part of this report analyses operational performance in both systems from an airline  and from an ANSP point of view. The airline perspective evaluates efficiency and predictability  compared to published schedules whereas the ANSP perspective provides a more in-depth  analysis of ATM-related performance by phase of flight compared to an ideal benchmark  distance or time. For the majority of indicators, trends are provided from 2008 to 2015 with a  focus on the change in performance from 2013 to 2015.  

Punctuality is generally considered to be the industry standard indicator for air transport service  quality. The trend in punctuality was similar in the US and Europe between 2005 and 2009 when  both systems reached a comparable level of around   $82\%$   of arrivals delayed by 15 minutes or  less in 2009. Whereas in the US performance remained stable in 2010, punctuality in Europe  degraded to the worst level on record mainly due to weather-related delays (snow, freezing  conditions) and strikes. From 2010 to 2012, punctuality in Europe improved again and continued  to improve in the US. However in 2013 and 2014, whereas punctuality in Europe remained  largely unchanged, punctuality in the US saw a sharp decline. In 2015 both systems reached  again a similar performance level due to notable improvements in the US and performance  degradation in Europe.  

While the evaluation of air transport performance compared to airline schedules provides  valuable first insights, the involvement of many different stakeholders and the inclusion of time  buffers in airline schedules limit the analysis from an air traffic management point of view.  Hence, the evaluation of ATM-related performance in this comparison aims to better understand  and quantify constraints imposed on airspace users through the application of air traffic flow  measures and therefore focuses more on the efficiency of operations by phase of flight  compared to an unconstrained benchmark distance or time.  

After the bad performance due to weather and strikes in 2010, average ATM-related departure  delay in Europe decreased again until 2013. Between 2013 and 2015, total ATM-related ground  delays increased in Europe by   $43.4\%$   whereas traffic grew by   $4.1\%$   during the same time. The US  has also shown an improvement since 2008, some of which can be attributed to improving  weather and declining traffic levels. Between 2013 and 2015, total ATM-related ground delay in  the US decreased by   $12.7\%$   (mainly due to less weather-related delays) with system-wide CONUS  traffic levels increasing by   $1.6\%$   during the same time. In Europe, the notable performance  deterioration between 2013 and 2015 was due to a significant increase in capacity/volume  related delays and to a lesser extent due to weather.  

ATM-related ground delay per flight in Europe (en-route and airport) was lower than in the US in  2015 (1.3 vs. 1.6 minutes per flight) however a larger percentage of flights is affected in Europe  $(4.3\%\lor\mathsf{S}\,3.3\%)$  . The underlying reasons and the application of ATM-related departure restrictions  among facilities differ notably between the two systems. Europe ascribes a greater percentage  of delay to en-route facilities (  $43\%$   of total delay in 2015) while in the US the large majority is  ascribed to constraints at the airport   $(82.1\%$   of total delay in 2015).  

The share of flights affected by ATM-related departure restrictions at origin airports differs  considerably between the US and Europe. Despite a reduction from   $5.0\%$   of all flights in 2008 to   $2.0\%$   in 2015, flights in Europe are still over twice more likely to be held at the gate or on the  ground for en-route constraints than in the US where the share of flights affected by ATM- related departure restrictions was  $0.8\%$   in 2015.  

For airport-related ground delays, the percentage of delayed flights at the gate or on the surface  is slightly lower in Europe than in the US   $\lvert2.3\%$   vs.   $2.5\%$   in 2015). However, with 51 minutes, the  delay per delayed flight in the US is notably higher than in Europe in 2015 (33 mins). In the US,  the airports which make up a large percentage of those delays are airports like New York (LGA),  Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Philadelphia (PHL) which  report a large number of hours with demand near or over capacity and have lower predictability  of capacity.  

Taxi-out efficiency improved continuously between 2007 and 2012 in the US but deteriorated  again by 0.5 minutes per departure between 2012 and 2015. During the same period, with the  exception of 2010 where taxi-out efficiency decreased due to the strong winter, performance in  Europe improved continuously at a moderate rate but also showed a slight deterioration in  2015.  

After a notable closure of the gap between the US and Europe until 2012, the performance gap  is widening again and in 2015 average additional taxi-out time in the US is, on average, some 1.5  minutes higher per departure than in Europe. This is largely driven by different flow control  policies and the absence of scheduling caps at most US airports. Whereas in Europe the  inefficiency levels in the taxi-out phase are more evenly spread among airports, the observed  taxi-out performance in the US is predominantly driven by the New York airports, Philadelphia  (PHL), and Chicago (ORD).  

Horizontal en-route flight efficiency (between a 40NM radius around the departure airport and a  100NM radius around the arrival airport) in filed flight plans and in actual trajectories is still  better in the US than in Europe in 2015. Overall, horizontal en-route efficiency on flights to or  from the main 34 airports in the US is approximately  $0.1\%$   better than in Europe in 2015.  

Similar to en-route flight efficiency, the US also continued to show a higher level of efficiency in  the last 100NM before landing. Overall, the average additional time within the last 100 NM  (Arrival Sequencing and Maneuvering Area (ASMA)) was similar in the two regions in 2008 but  decreased in the US between 2008 and 2010 after which it has remained almost constant at 2.5  minutes across the main airports. At the same time, flight efficiency within the last 100 NM  deteriorated in Europe. Although at different levels, performance in the US and in Europe  remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2015.  

At system level, average additional ASMA time was 2.5 minutes per arrival in the US in 2015  which was 0.4 minutes lower than in Europe. The result in Europe was significantly affected by  London Heathrow (LHR) which had an additional time of 9.5 minutes per arrival - almost twice  the level of London Gatwick (LGW) with 4.9 minutes per arrival in 2015. In the US, efficiency  levels in the terminal area are more homogenous.  

As there are many trade-offs between flight phases, the aggregation of the observed results  enables a high-level comparison of the “benefit pool” actionable by ATM in both systems.  For the interpretation of the observed results, it is important to stress that the determined  “benefit pool” is based on a theoretical optimum (averages compared to unimpeded  times), which is, due to inherent necessary (safety) or desired (capacity) limitations,  clearly not achievable at system level.  

Although in a context of declining traffic, system-wide ATM performance improved notably in  the US and in Europe between 2010 and 2015. The resulting savings in terms of time and fuel in  both ATM systems had a positive effect for airspace users and the environment.  

The improvement in Europe over the past five years was mainly driven by a notable reduction of  ATM-related departure delay, improvements in taxi-out efficiency, and better en-route flight  efficiency. In this context it is however important to point out that 2010 was a year with  comparatively high delays in Europe due to adverse weather and ATC strikes. The performance  improvement in the US was mainly due to a substantial improvement of taxi-out efficiency,  although average additional time in the taxi-out phase in the US increased again slightly in 2015.  

Overall, the relative distribution of the ATM-related inefficiencies associated with the different  phases of flight is consistent with the differences in flow management strategies described  throughout the report. In Europe ATM-related departure delays are much more frequently used  for balancing demand with en-route and airport capacity than in the US, which leads to a notably  higher share of traffic affected but with a lower average delay per delayed flight. Moreover the  share of en-route related Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) in Europe is close to   $50\%$   while in  the US more than   $80\%$   of TMIs are airport-related during 2015.  

Consequently, in Europe flights are over twice more likely to be held at the gate or on the  ground for en-route constraints than in the US. For TMIs related to arrival airport constraints the  situation is different. The percentage of delayed flights at the departure gate or on the surface is  slightly higher in the US than in Europe and the delay per delayed flight in the US is almost twice  as high as in Europe. Most of this delay in the US is generally linked to weather-related  constraints at a number of high density airports including, New York (LGA), Chicago (ORD),  Newark (EWR), San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Philadelphia (PHL).  

# 1. INTRODUCTION  

# 1.1   Background and objectives  

The US-Europe Comparison Report is jointly developed under Annex 2 of the Memorandum of  Cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union signed in 2013 and  managed by a joint European Commission-FAA Performance Analysis Review Committee (PARC).  

1 The EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU) and the US Air Traffic Organization  (FAA- ATO) have produced a series of joint performance studies using commonly agreed metrics and  definitions to compare, understand, and improve air traffic management (ATM) performance.  

The initial benchmark report comparing operational performance through 2008 was completed  in 2009 [Ref.1]. Subsequent benchmark reports comparing ATM performance in the US and  Europe have since been published in 2010, 2012, and 2014 [Ref.2]. This report is the 5th in the  series of joint ATM operational performance comparisons between the US and Europe.

3 States plus those States outside the EU that are members of EUROCONTROL , excluding Oceanic  areas, Georgia and the Canary Islands.  

Unless otherwise indicated,   $"{\sf U S}"$   refers to ANS provided by the United States of America in the  48 contiguous States located on the North American continent south of the border with Canada  plus the District of Columbia, but excluding Alaska, Hawaii and Oceanic areas (US CONUS).  

In order to ensure the comparability of operational ATM performance, the analysis scope of this  report was influenced by the need to identify a common set of data sources with a sufficient  level of detail and coverage. Therefore - unless stated otherwise - the detailed analyses of ATM- related operational performance by phase of flight in Chapter 5 are limited to flights to or from  the main 34 airports for IFR traffic in both the US and in Europe. A detailed list of the airports  included in this report can be found in Annex I.  

Although they are within the top 34 airports in terms of traffic in Europe in 2015, Istanbul  Ataturk (IST), Istanbul (SAW), Antalya (AYT), and Warsaw (WAW) airports were not included in  the analysis due to data availability issues.  

The 34 main airports used for more detailed performance tracking are also shown in Figure 1-1.  Although these airports remain consistent for the most part, there have been minor changes  since the last comparison report in 2013. In the US, Dallas Love (DAL) and Nashville (BNA) have  replaced Cleveland (CLE) and Raleigh-Durham (RDU).  

For the US, many of these high volume airports are located on the coasts or edges of the study  region creating a greater percentage of longer haul flights in the US, especially when only flights  within the study region are considered. The airborne trajectory on these transcontinental flights  may be more affected by the influences of wind and convective weather.  

T EMPORAL  S COPE  

The operational analyses in this report were carried out for the calendar year 2015 and, where  applicable, comparisons to previous years were made to track changes over time. In particular,  this report contrasts the performance of 2015 versus the performance observed (and reported)  in the 2013 edition of this report.  

# 1.3   Data Sources  

Various data sources have been used for the analysis of operational ATM performance. These  data sources include, inter alia, trajectory position data, ATFM imposed delay, key event times  and scheduled data from airlines, and METAR information for weather.  

D ATA FROM AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS  

Both the US and Europe obtain key data from their respective air traffic flow management  (ATFM) systems. There are two principal sources within ATM. These include trajectory/flight plan  databases used for flight efficiency indicators, and delay databases that record ATFM delay and  often include causal reasons for the delay.  

For the US, flight data come from the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS). In Europe, data  are derived from the Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System (ETFMS) of the European  Network Manager. These data sources provide the total IFR traffic picture and are used to  determine the “main” airports in terms of IFR traffic and the flight hour counts used to  determine traffic density.  

Both ATFM systems have data repositories with detailed data on individual flight plans and  surveillance track sample points from actual flight trajectories. They also have built-in    capabilities for tracking ATM-related ground delays by airport and en-route reference location.  

The data sets also provide flight trajectories which are used for the calculation of flight efficiency  in terms of planned routes and actual flown routing. The data sets which include data in the en- route transitional phase and in the terminal areas allow for performance comparison throughout  various phases of flight. This report features an initial assessment of vertical flight efficiency for a  subset of airports based on the aforementioned trajectory data.  

D ATA FROM AIRLINES  

The US and Europe receive operational and delay data from airlines for scheduled flights. This  represents a more detailed subset of the traffic flow data described above and is used for  punctuality or phase of flight indicators where more precise times are required.  

These data include what is referred to as OOOI (Gate Out, Wheels Off, Wheels On, and Gate In)  times which are recorded to 1 minute resolution. OOOI data along with airline schedules allow  for the calculation of gate delay, taxi times, en-route times, and gate arrival time delay on a flight  by flight basis. The data also contains cause codes for delays on a flight-by-flight basis.  

In the US, most performance indicators are derived from the Aviation System Performance  Metrics (ASPM) database which fuses detailed airline data with data from the traffic flow  management system (TFMS). Air carriers are required to report performance data if they have at  least   $1\%$   of total domestic scheduled-service passenger revenues. In addition there are other  carriers that report voluntarily. ASPM coverage in 2015 was approximately  $94\%$  of the IFR traffic  at the main 34 airports with   $87\%$   of the total IFR traffic reported as scheduled operations.  Airline-reported performance data for traffic at the main 34 airports represent   $71\%$  of all IFR  flights at these airports. This percentage as well as the specific carriers that report does not stay  constant from reporting period to reporting period and this has some effect on the performance  indicators based on OOOI data.  For the US, this effect was most pronounced for airports with  high use by American Airline (AAL) in which OOOI coverage increased (CLT, ORD).  There was also  some effect for airports such as Detroit (DTW) with high use of certain regional carriers such as  Endeavor Air (FLG) which moved from reporting to non-reporting from 2013-2015.  

In Europe, the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA) collects data from airlines each month.  The data collection started in 2002 and the reporting was voluntary until the end of 2010. As of  4 January 2011, airlines which operate more than 35 000 flights per year  within the European  Union (EU) airspace are required to submit the data on a monthly basis according to EU  Regulations [Ref.3]. In 2015, the CODA coverage was approximately   $62\%$   of total IFR flights and  approximately  $74\%$   of flights at the 34 main airports.  

A significant difference between the two airline data collections is that the delay causes in the  US relate to arrivals, whereas in Europe they relate to the delays experienced at departure.  

ANS   P ERFORMANCE  D ATA  

This comparison study builds on the data describing the ANS operations within the  aforementioned scope of the US and European region. Within the field of air transport statistics  a variety of sources report on air traffic. Care has to be taken when comparing the data from  different sources, as data collection and reporting requirements entail different conventions  concerning the breakdown of the data in terms of flight operations, type of flights, etc.  

Within the US, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) establishes air traffic related data  and statistics for the purpose of analysing the US air transportation market. The underlying  statistical data collection process accounts for flights of US carriers with an annual revenue of  20M USD or more and flights of foreign carriers with more than 10 000 passengers per month  (to/from the US).  

Across Europe, different sources report on air traffic statistics also for the purpose of market  analysis. For example, Eurostat reports on air traffic observed at EU-28 level, while different  States (typically the national civil aviation authorities or associated statistics agencies) report  traffic at the national level with varying granularity levels or breakdowns.  

The data sets used in this study are derived from the aforementioned systems and ensure  comparability of the data with respect to the provision of air navigation services and operational  ANS performance.  

A DDITIONAL DATA ON CONDITIONS  

Post-operational analysis should identify the causes of delay and a better understanding of real  constraints. In identifying causal factors, additional data is needed for airport capacities, runway  configurations, sector capacities, winds, visibility, and convective weather.  For this report,  airport capacities and meteorological data have been used (see Chapter 3).  

# 1.4   European and FAA Performance Reporting  

Both FAA and European ANSPs have their own reporting requirements. Some Key Performance  Indicators (KPIs) such as ATM attributable delay are common to both groups using calculations  and underlying databases that are very similar. There are other indicators that are common but  have different priorities in terms of reporting status and/or regulation. For example, European  indicators use horizontal trajectory efficiency and ATFM delay for official target setting whereas  FAA management focuses on Capacity and Capacity Efficiency for official targets.  FAA, under  RTCA and the NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC) also report Block Time, Track Distance,  Throughput, Taxi-out Time and Gate Departure Delay [Ref. 4]. These metrics, using definitions  that have been harmonized for joint EU/US benchmarking are part of later chapters of this  report.  

The report examines several operational key performance indicators derived from comparable  databases for both EUROCONTROL and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  

K EY  P ERFORMANCE  A REAS  (KPA S )  AND  K EY  P ERFORMANCE INDICATORS  (KPI S )  

Comparisons and benchmarking require common definitions and understanding. Hence the work  in this report draws from commonly accepted elements of previous work from ICAO, the FAA,  EUROCONTROL and CANSO. An outcome of these performance evaluations is the development  of harmonized key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be used for international  benchmarking. The KPIs used in this report are associated with ICAO’s Key Performance Areas  (KPAs) and are developed using the best available data from both the FAA-ATO and the  EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU).  

In its Manual on Global Performance of the Air Navigation System [Ref. 5], ICAO identified eleven  Key Performance Areas (KPAs) of interest in understanding overall ATM system performance:  Access and Equity, Capacity, Cost Effectiveness, Efficiency, Environmental Sustainability,  Flexibility, Global Interoperability, Predictability, Participation, Safety, and Security.  

At the time of writing this report, ICAO is in the process of updating the Global Air Navigation  Plan (GANP, ICAO Doc 9750 [Ref. 6]). As part of this update, the 2016 ICAO assembly will endorse  the recognition of ATM performance monitoring. The 2016 update to the GANP includes  documentation for 16 potential KPIs that are recommended for tracking performance  improvements and identifying performance shortfalls. The US/Europe comparison reports  provide demonstrated application for many of these indicators. The reports also show how  common indicators can be used to benchmark performance across facilities and across ICAO  regions.  

This report addresses the Key Performance Areas that relate to the operational efficiency of the  ATM system. These are the KPAs of Capacity, Efficiency, Predictability, and Environmental  Sustainability as it is linked to Efficiency when evaluating additional fuel burn.  

Table 1-1 provides an overview of the harmonized KPIs used in this report that are associated  with the ICAO KPAs. Many of these indicators are linked. All flight efficiency indicators have a  degree of variability which may be reported as a KPI for Predictability.  

![Table 1-1: US/Europe Harmonized Key Performance Indicators   ](images/30a043f64d48ed3a730d1b2eb80a9ff19d71bcdaff7d93240f02fd758ecb886e.jpg)  

In addition to the KPIs listed in Table 1-1, this report also provides a series of related indicators  that help to explain why a KPI improved or became worse over time. These related indicators do  not fit the standard ICAO KPA framework. However they are typical indicators that would be  monitored by an ANSP to help explain how external factors may influence the core KPIs. These  Related Indicators principally address operator demand and weather. Table 1-2 below shows the  main related indicators reported.  

![Table 1-2: US/Europe - related indicators  ](images/7457128b6de5f4ed95459a7b796c8d7948d205ce3fbd5715a226916b15b9a333.jpg)  

# 1.5   Organisation of this report  

The report is organised into seven chapters:  

   Chapter 1 contains the introduction and provides some background on report objectives,  scope and data sources used for the analyses for ATM performance in this report. It also  lists the Key Performance Indicators and related indicators that are studied in this report.      Chapter 2 provides background information on the two ATM systems that may also be  used to explain differences in the core KPIs. These include differences in air traffic flow  management techniques as well as external factors such as weather and capacity  restrictions which can be shown to have a large influence on performance.     Chapter 3 provides a quantitative overview of the indicators that may externally influence  the KPIs related to ATM performance. These are principally related to changes in traffic  levels, traffic peaks, capacity at the aerodrome, and meteorological conditions.       Chapter 4 provides a comparison of airline-related KPIs. These indicators assess delay and  operational service quality as it relates to the airline schedule. It includes the causal  reasons for delay as provided by the airlines.     Chapter 5 provides a detailed comparison of the ATM-related KPIs focusing on ATFM delay  and the efficiency of actual operations by phase of flight. It includes causal reasons for  delay as provided by the ANSP.     Chapter 6 introduces two supporting studies aimed at further expanding the scope and  the level of analysis of the U.S. / Europe comparison of operational performance. The first  study analyses air traffic flow and capacity management in more detail and the second  study addresses vertical flight efficiency in the arrival phase.      Chapter 7 concludes with a summary of findings.  

# 2.   COMPARISON OF AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (ATM) IN THE US AND EUROPE  

This section provides background information on both the US and European ATM systems that  may be used to explain similarities and differences in the KPIs used throughout this report. This  section starts with a comparison in terms of physical geographic airspace and organisation of  ATM.  

# 2.1   Organisation of ATM  

While the US and the European system are operated with similar technology and operational  concepts, there is a key difference. The US system is operated by one single service provider  using the same tools and equipment, communication processes and a common set of rules and  procedures. Although ATFM and ASM in Europe are provided/coordinated centrally by the  Network Manager, at the ATC level the European system is much more fragmented and the  provision of air navigation services is still largely organised by State boundaries.  

In total, there are 37 different en-route ANSPs of various geographical areas. Historically, they  have been operating different systems under slightly different sets of rules and procedures.  Since 2004, the Single European Sky (SES) initiative of the European Union aims at reducing this  fragmentation. It provides the framework for the creation of additional capacity and for  improved efficiency and interoperability of the ATM system in Europe.  

# 2.2   Airspace management (ASM) and design  

In the US the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for airspace management and  route design, whereas in the amalgamated European ATM system, airspace management was  traditionally the prerogative of the individual States.  

In the current system, the design of airspace and related procedures is no longer carried out or  implemented in isolation in Europe. Inefficiencies in the design and use of the air route network  are considered to be a contributing factor towards flight inefficiencies in Europe, therefore the  development of an integrated European Route Network Design is one of the tasks given to the  5 Network Manager . This is done through a CDM process involving all stakeholders.  

A further challenge is the integration of military objectives and requirements which need to be  fully coordinated within the respective ATM system. To meet their national security and training  requirements while ensuring the safety of other airspace users, it is occasionally necessary to  restrict or segregate airspace for exclusive use which may conflict with civilian objectives to  improve flight efficiency as flights must then detour around these areas. To accommodate the  increasing needs of both sets of stakeholders, in terms of volume and time, close civil/military  cooperation and coordination across all ATM-related activities is a key requirement.  

In terms of the organisation of the civil/military cooperation, the US and Europe both apply a  similar model:  

   In the US, the DoD Policy Board on Federal Aviation (PBFA) is the single voice of the  military services in communicating the DoD position on airspace policy and air traffic  management as both a global air navigation service provider and user; at the operational  6 level the FAA headquarters is the final approval authority  for all permanent and  7 temporary Special Use Airspace (SUA) , and operations are organised according to a  common set of rules.  

   In Europe, the European Defence Agency (EDA) represents the interests of military  aviation in the development of the Single European Sky; at the operational level, through  the implementation of the Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept – which is included in  EU legislation since 2005 [Ref. 7] – the Network Manager coordinates civil and military  requirements through a dynamic CDM process which culminates in the publication of the  daily European Airspace Use Plan (AUP) on D-1 and Updated Airspace Use Plans (UUP) on  the day of operations. The AUP and UUP activate Conditional Routes and allocate  Temporary Segregated Areas and Cross-Border Areas for specific periods of time.  

Looking at the map, the comparison of SUA between the US and Europe (in Europe generally  referred to as segregated airspace) in Figure 2-1 illustrates a significant difference in the number  8 and location of the special use airspace within the respective ATM systems . It is to be  emphasised that these airspace volumes are not all active at the same time, because they are  managed flexibly.  

![](images/72976d751813d555a3d91700f6288833aba58c75610dce3eceeea6860b262514.jpg)  
Figure 2-1: Comparison of Special Use Airspace (SUA)  

Europe clearly shows a larger number of SUA than the US with quite a number being located  directly in the core area of Europe and potentially affecting the flow of civil air traffic. In the US,  SUA tends to be more located along the coastlines allowing for less constrained transcontinental  connections.

# 2.3   Air traffic flow management (ATFM) and air traffic control (ATC)  

ATFM is a function of air traffic management (ATM) established with the objective of  contributing to a safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of traffic while minimizing delays. The  purpose of ATFM is to avoid safety risks associated with overloaded ATC sectors by regulating  traffic demand according to available capacity. When ATFM also includes a capacity  management function, it is called ATFCM. At the tactical level, ATC also plays a role in flow  management.  

This section compares the similarities and differences between the US and Europe in terms of  facility organization and the strategies for balancing demand and capacity.  

2.3.1   ATFM  AND  ATC   F ACILITY ORGANIZATION  

Both the US and Europe have established system-wide, centralised traffic management facilities  to ensure that traffic flows do not exceed what can be safely handled by ATC units, while trying  to optimise the use of available capacity. Table 2-1 provides an overview of the key players  involved and the most common ATFM techniques applied [Ref.8].  

![Table 2-1: Organisation of ATFM (Overview)   ](images/7fb8405e914a52618fa4920cb4167580b1c6ab619bc3cf7ed36a0518e8bc97a0.jpg)  

The key difference is that the European ATM system is an amalgamation of a large number of  individual ANSPs whereas the US system is operated by a single ANSP.  

There are 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centres (ARTCC) in the US CONUS compared to 62 ACCs in  9 Europe . Figure 2-2 depicts the size of the 20 US ARTCCs compared to the 20 largest ACCs in  Europe, in terms of average daily IFR flights.  

![](images/c034a79204f5fd5859ace076a4fc47ba079fb1b2eb834fea6d7727b54f238b6c.jpg)  
Figure 2-2: Comparison of en-route area control centres (2015)  

A further key difference between the two systems is the role of the network ATFM function. The  fact that the ATM system in the US is operated by a single provider puts the Air Traffic Control  System Command Center (ATCSCC) in a much stronger position with more active involvement of  tactically managing traffic on the day of operations than is the case in Europe.  

As far as traffic management issues are concerned, there is a clear hierarchy in the US. Terminal  Radar Approach Control (TRACON) units work through the overlying ARTCC which coordinate  directly with the ATCSCC in Virginia. The ATCSCC has final approval authority for all national  traffic management initiatives in the US and is also responsible for resolving inter-facility issues.  

In Europe, the Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) in Brussels monitors the traffic  situation and proposes flow measures which are coordinated through a CDM process with the  local authority. Usually the local Flow Management Positions (FMP), embedded in ACCs to  coordinate the air traffic flow management in the area of its responsibility, requests the NMOC  to implement flow measures.  

In 2009, the role of the network function in Europe was strengthened by the second package of  10 Single European Sky (SES) legislation . This evolution foresees a more proactive role in Air Traffic  Flow Management, ATC capacity enhancement, airspace structure development and the support  to the deployment of technological improvements across the ATM network for the European  Network Manager.  

In order to minimize the effects of ATM system constraints, the US and Europe use a comparable  11 methodology to balance demand and capacity . This is accomplished through the application of  an “ATFM planning and management” process, which is a collaborative, interactive capacity and  airspace planning process, where airport operators, ANSPs, Airspace Users (AUs), military  authorities, and other stakeholders work together to improve the performance of the ATM  system (see Figure 2-3).  

This CDM process allows AUs to optimize their participation in the ATM system while mitigating  the impact of constraints on airspace and airport capacity. It also allows for the full realization of  the benefits of improved integration of airspace design, ASM and ATFM. The process contains a  number of equally important phases:  

   ATM planning     ATFM execution   $\bigcirc$    Strategic ATFM  o   Pre-tactical ATFM  o   Tactical ATFM  o   Fine-tuning of traffic flows by ATC (shown in Figure 2-3 as Optimized operations)     Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) that have an impact on traffic prior to take-off     TMIs acting on airborne traffic     Post-operations analysis.  

A detailed description and comparison of the different phases – including an overview of the  various TMIs used on both sides of the Atlantic can be found in Annex II.  

![](images/536d93fc01666573773a5de399d73d7ce9389b867219b41f59ec7a12c4a173f6.jpg)  
Figure 2-3: Generic ATFM process (ICAO Doc 9971)  

# 3.   EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  

This chapter describes and quantifies the effects of some of the key external factors that impact  the primary Key Performance Indicators. These related indicators focus on changing traffic  levels, airport capacity, and   weather in the US and Europe. In addition to external factors, the  way the ATM system is managed with the US having a single provider compared to the European  system of multiple ANSPs can also influence the resulting KPIs. These differences in the ATM  systems are addressed in more detail in Chapter 2.  

# 3.1   Traffic characteristics in the US and in Europe  

This section provides some key air traffic characteristics of the ATM system in the US and in  Europe to provide some background information and to ensure comparability of traffic samples.  

![Table 3-1: US/Europe ATM key system figures at a glance (2015)  ](images/ca9270c990b74f04c9f34a9ae89cf2013eb05581504abe4826dea777d00d2940.jpg)  

As shown in Table 3-1, the total surface of continental airspace analysed in the report is similar  for Europe and the US. However, the US controls approximately   $57\%$   more flights operating  21 22 under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)  with less Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs)  and fewer en- route and terminal facilities.  

Using the definition employed by the ACE and CANSO benchmarking reports which excludes  those designated as “on-the-job training” in Europe or as a “developmental” at the FAA, the US  operated with some  $24\%$   less full time ATCOs than Europe in 2014/2015.  

For the ATM system, Europe is more fragmented and operates with more physical facilities than  the US. Currently the European study region comprises 37 ANSPs (and a similar number of  different regulators), 62 Area Control Centres (ACC) and 16 stand-alone Approach Control (APP)  units (total: 78 facilities). The US has one ANSP and the US CONUS is served by 20 Air Route  Traffic Control Centres (ARTCC) supplemented by 26 stand-alone TRACONs providing services to  multiple airports (total: 46 facilities). In addition the US has 134 Approach Control Facilities  combined with Tower services; Europe has 262 collocated APP units.  

A notable difference illustrated in Table 3-1 is the low number of airports with schedule or slot  limitations in the US compared to Europe, where most of the airports are slot-coordinated.  

Notwithstanding the large number of airports in the US and Europe, only a relatively small  number of airports account for the main share of traffic. The main 34 airports account for  approximately  $64\%$   of the controlled flights in Europe and the US.  

3.1.1   A IR TRAFFIC GROWTH  

Figure 3-1 depicts the evolution  of IFR traffic in the US and in  Europe between 2000 and  2015.  

There was a notable decoupling  in 2004 when the traffic in  Europe continued to grow  while US traffic started to  decline. Whereas traffic in  Europe grew by   $15.5\%$   between  2000 and 2015, the traffic in  the US declined by   $-13.8\%$    during the same period.  

![](images/c9f37d8785455a02041dd768e196b0ac600ca2c75ee5f930f45db86450952337.jpg)  
Figure 3-1: Evolution of IFR traffic in the US and in Europe  

Although traffic in the US CONUS grew by   $1.6\%$   from 2013-2015, the traffic at the main 34  airports was unchanged over this time period (Figure 3-9 below). The effect of the economic  crisis starting in 2008 is clearly visible on both sides of the Atlantic.  

The system level averages mask contrasted growth rates within the US and Europe as illustrated  in the map in Figure 3-2. Traffic growth in Europe shows a contrasted picture between the more  mature markets in Western Europe and the emerging markets in Central & Eastern Europe which  shows a substantial growth. Also the notable shift of traffic following the tragic loss of MH17 in  Ukrainian airspace in July 2014 and the resulting airspace closure contributed to some of the  observed high growth rates in States affected by changed traffic flows.  

![](images/427d2fc360075308a61d99166e13ee608c003a8b7945fc7ca3fc7100ee2b8b7a.jpg)  
Figure 3-2: Evolution of IFR traffic in the US and in Europe (2015 vs. 2010)  

The US is a more homogenous and mature market which shows a different behaviour. Compared  to 2010, traffic levels stayed relatively constant, aside from the Florida centers, which  experienced a stronger growth. The traffic growth at the main airports in the US and Europe is  shown in Figure 3-8 and Figure 3-9 on page 29 respectively.  

# 3.1.2   A IR TRAFFIC DENSITY  

Figure 3-3 shows the traffic density in US and European en-route centres measured in annual  flight hours per square kilometre for all altitudes in 2015. For Europe, the map is shown at the  State level because the display by en-route centre would hide the centres in lower airspace.  

![](images/9b9a51316d585c11dbee6f941a1c424d658bf90a2ca460907119ebddf6bc4f23.jpg)  
Figure 3-3: Traffic density in the US and in Europe (2015)  

In Europe, the “core area” comprising of the Benelux States, Northeast France, Germany, and  Switzerland is the densest and most complex airspace.  

Similarly in the US, the centrally located centres of Cleveland (ZOB), Chicago (ZAU), Indianapolis  (ZID), and Atlanta (ZTL) have flight hour densities of more than twice the CONUS-wide average.  The New York Centre (ZNY) appears less dense due to the inclusion of a portion of  coastal/oceanic airspace. If this portion was excluded, ZNY would be the centre with the highest  density in the US.  

# 3.1.3   A VERAGE FLIGHT LENGTH  

Table 3-2 provides a more detailed breakdown of IFR traffic for the US and Europe in 2015. The  average great circle distances shown in Table 3-2 refer only to the distances flown within the  respective airspace and not the length of the entire flight.  

![ Table 3-2:   Breakdown of IFR traffic ](images/8479d71b4bca0db9788473beb627800c656038c4122f336c79c5e359f5538fc4.jpg)  

The table is broken into two parts which both show similar trends. The top portion shows all  flights while the lower focuses on traffic to or from the main 34 airports. The population of  flights in the lower part of the table (traffic to or from the main 34 airports) is the basis for many  of the metrics in this report.  

By far the largest share of total IFR traffic in both systems is due to traffic within the respective  region. In the US this share is   $83.9\%$  compared to  $78.4\%$   in Europe. When all IFR flights including  overflights are taken into account, the average flight length in Europe is 575 NM compared to  524 NM in the US.  

However, this changes when only “domestic” flights within the respective regions are  considered. For example, en-route efficiency indicators shown later in Section 5.2.3 use “within  region” traffic to or from the main 34 airports (lower part of Table 3-2). For this population, the  average flight length in the US is 625 NM compared to 581 NM in Europe.  This is due mainly to  the large amount of transcontinental traffic in the US system.  

For the US, a significant amount of “Outside Region” traffic have a coastal airport as a final  destination or traverse a significant distance through Canada before entering US airspace. For  Europe, the “Outside Region” traffic is less concentrated at coastal entry airports but more  scattered with direct long haul flights to worldwide destinations from almost every capital city  airport. For instance, a flight from London Heathrow (LHR) to the Middle East would traverse  almost the entire European airspace before exiting the airspace. As a consequence, the average  distance of those flights is considerably higher in Europe than in the US.  

Seasonality and variability of air traffic demand can be a factor affecting ATM performance. If  traffic is highly variable, resources may be underutilised during off-peak times but scarce at peak  times. Figure 3-4 compares the seasonal variability (relative difference in traffic levels with  respect to the yearly averages) and the “within week” variability.

Figure 3-4: Seasonal traffic variability in the US and Europe (system level)  

Whereas weekly traffic profiles in Europe and the US are similar (lowest level of traffic during  weekends), the seasonal variation is higher in Europe. European traffic shows a clear peak during  the summer months. Compared to average, traffic in Europe is in summer about   $15\%$   higher  whereas in the US the seasonal variation is more moderate.  

Figure 3-5 shows the seasonal traffic variability in the US and in Europe for 2015. In Europe, a  very high level of seasonal variation is observed for the holiday destinations in South Eastern  Europe where a comparatively low number of flights in winter contrast sharply with high  demand in summer.

Figure 3-5: Seasonal traffic variability in the US and in Europe (2015)  

In the US, the overall seasonality is skewed by the high summer traffic in northern en-route  centres (Boston, Chicago, and Minneapolis) offsetting the high winter/spring traffic of southern  centres (Miami and Jacksonville) (see Figure 3-5).  

3.1.5   T RAFFIC MIX  

A notable difference between the US and Europe is the share of general aviation which accounts  for   $22\%$   and   $3.7\%$  of total traffic in 2015, respectively (see Table 3-1 on page 21). This is  confirmed by the distribution of physical aircraft classes in Figure 3-6 which shows a large share  of smaller aircraft in the US for all IFR traffic (left side of Figure 3-6).  

![](images/c5daab86889fed6590b34bc65ab6cdd98b28d5cb7a502ee7f349624d68c331e6.jpg)  
Figure 3-6: Comparison by physical aircraft class (2015)  

In order to improve comparability of data sets, the more detailed analyses in Chapters 4 and 5  are limited to controlled IFR flights either originating from or arriving to the main 34 US and  European airports (see Annex I). The samples are more comparable when only flights to and  from the 34 main airports are analysed as this removes a large share of the smaller piston and  turboprop aircraft (general aviation traffic), particularly in the US. Traffic to or from the main 34  airports in 2015 represents some   $64\%$   of all IFR flights in Europe and in the US.  

Figure 3-7 shows the evolution of the number of average seats per scheduled flight in the US and  in Europe, based on data for passenger aircraft.  

![](images/085eed5bd8d3e6c6b1b3efdd54402d61e2808646d379b6530bf7441818953fd5.jpg)  
Figure 3-7: Average seats per scheduled flight (2005-2015)  

For 2015, the average number of seats per scheduled flight is   $28\%$   higher in Europe for traffic to  or from the main 34 airports. This is consistent with the observation in Figure 3-6 showing a  higher share of larger aircraft in Europe.  

Whereas in Europe the average number of seats per flight increased continuously between 2005  and 2015, the number of seats per aircraft declined in the US between 2008 and 2010.   However, recent US trends since 2010 point to an increase in aircraft gauge. Figure 3-7 indicates  the potential for growing the number of US passengers with relatively flat or modest growth in  operations.  

The notable difference observed in aircraft gauge in the two regions is tied to the different  practices of airlines, which are linked to demand, market competition, and other factors [Ref. 9].  An increasing number of European low cost carriers are utilising a high density one-class seat  layout compared to a standard two-class configuration preferred by US carriers. Additionally,  since only a few US airports are slot restricted, this enables airlines to increase the frequency of  service (with smaller aircraft) to win market share and to attract high yield business travellers.  

The notable increase in the US since 2013 is assumed to be the result of consolidation that  resulted, on average, in fewer frequencies but with larger aircraft.  

# 3.2   Airport operations and changes in airport capacity  

The system wide and facility level performance indicators shown in Chapters 4 and 5 are driven  by airport operations (demand), airport capacity and the imbalance that can occur between  demand and capacity.  Facilities with a) high levels of operations; b) demand that is near  capacity, or; c) having capacity that is highly variable, i.e. unpredictable, will tend to form the  dominant contributors to system performance.  Understanding changes in these factors can also  help in understanding year over year changes.  This section, along with Section 3.3 on weather,  provides a quantification of these related factors influencing the reported KPIs.  

Airport operations depend upon a number of factors as well as on interactions between them  which all affect runway capacity to some degree. In addition to physical constraints, such as  airport layout, there are “strategic” factors such as airport scheduling and “tactical” factors  which include, inter alia, the sequencing of aircraft and the sustainability of throughput during  specific weather conditions.  

Safe operation of aircraft on the runway and in surrounding airspace is the dominant constraint  of runway throughput. Airport layout and runway configuration, traffic mix, runway occupancy  time of aircraft during take-off and landing, separation minima, wake vortex, ATC procedures,  weather conditions and environmental restrictions - all affect the throughput at an airport.  

The runway throughput is directly related to the time needed to accommodate each flight safely.  23 The separation requirements in segregated mode  depend on the most constraining of any one  of the three parameters: (1) wake vortex separation, (2) radar separation, or (3) runway  occupancy time. The challenge is to optimise final approach spacing in line with wake vortex and  radar separation requirements so that the spacing is close to runway occupancy time. For mixed  24 mode runway operations , throughput is driven by inter arrival spacings into which departures  are interleaved.  

E NVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS  

One of the major challenges of airport communities is the need to balance airport capacity  requirements with the need to manage aircraft noise and negative effects on the population in  the airport vicinity. Quite a number of airports in Europe operate under some environmental  constraints which invariably affect runway throughput, the level of complexity and therefore,  ATM performance.  

The main affecting factors are (1) Noise Preferential Routes and Standard Instrument Departure,  (2) Restrictions on runway mode of operations and configurations, and (3) night noise  regulations. In the early morning, night noise curfews might even result in considerable arrival  holding with a negative impact on fuel burn and thence  $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$   emissions.  

More work is required to better understand the differences in the impact of environmental  constraints on ATM performance in Europe and the US (i.e. how noise and emissions are handled  in the two systems and the potential impact on performance).  

# 3.2.1   A IRPORT LAYOUT AND OPERATIONS AT THE MAIN  34  AIRPORTS  

The number of operations which can be safely accommodated at an airport not only depends on  the number of runways but also to a large extent on runway layout and available configurations  (many runways may not be operated independently). The choice of the configuration depends  on a number of factors including weather conditions and wind direction, type of operation  (arrival/ departure peak) and environmental considerations such as noise constraints. The  configuration, combined with environmental restrictions, as well as apron and terminal airspace  limitations affect the overall capacity of the airport.  

Some of the key factors determining runway throughput are the distance between runways  25 26 27 (dependent or independent ), the mode of operation (mixed  or segregated ), and  geographical layout (intersecting runways, crossing taxiways).  

Although some airports technically have a  large number of runways, operational data  shows that the applied configurations  restrict the type of operations and runways  to be used at any one time.  

For this reason, the number of runways  used for the comparison of operations at  the 34 main airports in the US and in Europe  in Table 3-3 was based on statistical analysis  (see grey box) rather than the physical  runway count. The passenger numbers are  based on Airport Council International (ACI)  data and refer to all operations.  

![](images/44befccb292147cb51e902347c99783eef2478a836d3c760787d091baa2bbe43.jpg)  

Use of runways at the airports  

In previous versions (2008 and 2010) of the report the  number of existing physical runways was used for the  computation of the indicators in Table 3-3.  Acknowledging that not all physical runways are available  for use at any one time, a different methodology was used  to determine the number of runways in use at each of the  airports.  In a first step, the number of simultaneously active runways  was determined for each 15 minute interval. A runway (e.g.  09R/27L) was considered as being active if used in any of  the directions.   In a second step, the upper 10th percentile of the  distribution was used as the number of simultaneously  active runways at the respective airport. The number of  physical runways might be higher.  

![Table 3-3: Comparison of operations at the 34 main airports in the US and Europe  ](images/0148db05bfe37c582ec95c93a36c82f0eda9f14bc774a54cdedda742a710373e.jpg)  

There were several airport development projects in the US since 2008, including new runways at  Chicago O’Hare (ORD), Charlotte (CLT), Seattle (SEA), and Dulles (IAD). A runway extension was  also completed for Philadelphia (PHL) that resulted in improved capacity for the airport. In  Europe, a fourth runway went into operation at Frankfurt (FRA) airport in October 2011.  

Table 3-3 shows that the average number of IFR movements   $(+61\%)$   and the number of annual  passengers per airport   $(+30\%)$   are significantly higher in the US than in Europe. Consistent with  Figure 3-6 and Figure 3-7, the number of passengers per movement is much lower   $(\mathord{\cdot}19\%)$   in the  US due to the US on average utilizing a larger share of smaller aircraft and offering fewer seats  per scheduled flight.  

Figure 3-8 shows the average number of daily IFR departures at the 34 main European and US  airports.  

![](images/bc0c8d6d89fce49f1e63e8ffda41616d5fe626a782845ef08e5a6596395be724.jpg)  

The IFR flights are the basis for the majority of the trends and analysis presented in this report.  The average number of IFR departures per airport (522) is considerably higher   $(62\%)$   in the US,  compared to 323 average daily departures at the 34 main airports in Europe in   $2015^{28}$  .  

Figure 3-9 shows the change in IFR departures by airport compared to 2013. In the US, the  airports with the highest decrease in departures between 2013 and 2015 are Detroit (-64),  Denver (-55), and Washington (-50), and the airports showing a growth in departures compared  to 2013 include Seattle   $(+87)$  , Dallas Love (DAL)   $(+55)$   and New York JFK   $(+44)$  .  Although overall  traffic in the US increased by   $1.6\%$  , the average traffic level for the main 34 population was  virtually unchanged.  

![](images/6fef9d20deef5b47970b849cc268ff0be39d581b243afe5a5e45bf68c82642dd.jpg)  

In Europe, the airports with the highest decrease in terms of departures were Lyon (-10), Vienna  (VIE) (-7), and Frankfurt (-6). The airports showing an increase in departures compared to 2013  include Athens   $(+46)$  , Madrid   $(+46)$  , and Dublin   $(+37)$  .  

In Europe, the declared airport capacity is a limit  typically set as early as six months before the day  of operations through a coordination process  involving the airport managing body, the airlines,  and local ATC.  

In the US, the FAA called arrival rates reflect  tactical, real time values based on the number of  operations  scheduled,  available  runway  configuration,  and  weather,  among  other  considerations.  

95th percentile   airport peak arrival throughput  

The peak arrival throughput is an approximation of  the operational airport capacity in ideal conditions. It  is the 95th percentile of the number of aircraft in the  “rolling” hours sorted from the least busy to the  busiest hour.  

The indicator has, however, limitations when the  peak throughput is lower than the peak declared  capacity, in which case it is necessary to determine  whether a variation in peak arrival throughput is  driven by a change in demand or by a change in  operational airport capacity.  

Figure 3-10 provides a comparison of the two types of capacities and throughput described  above. Although they are developed and used for different purposes, the values may provide  some insights into the role of capacity on operational performance.  

![](images/a9e6d67af685adc5cb54f197c811e4b11202cba822de3497ab4b18b98916c8b0.jpg)  
Figure 3-10: Actual airport throughput vs. declared capacity (2015)  

The figure depicts the peak arrival capacity (peak called arrival rates for US airports and peak  declared arrival capacities for European airports) together with the airports’  $95^{\mathrm{{th}}}$   percentile peak  arrival throughput (see grey box). The airports are furthermore categorised by the number of  active runways (see Section 3.2.1 for the computation of the number of active runways).  

This grouping allows for a first order comparison among different airports. It is however  recognised that this simplified analysis should be viewed with a note of caution as there are  significant differences in runway layout among airports in the same class that can explain the  variation.  

In the US and Europe, airports with one and even two active runways are more comparable in  terms of peak arrival capacity for the two regions. For the US, the two active runway case  average value (47) is influenced by the ability to operate in mixed mode with independent  runways for Tampa (TPA) and Portland (PDX).  Otherwise the grouping is more comparable.  

For airports with three or more active runways, the peak arrival capacity at US airports is on  average notably higher than at European airports. The majority of US airports have three or  more active runways whereas in Europe, most of the airports have one or two active runways.  

Despite normalising the comparison by grouping airports by number of active runways, airport  capacities within the same active runway grouping can be starkly different due to differing  runway layouts, runway dependencies and aircraft fleet mix. In general, the US airports with  high value arrival capacity rates in the same class indicate the use of runways in mixed mode  where arrivals are possible among all active runways. As such, Munich (MUC), Minneapolis  (MSP), Tampa (TPA), and Portland (PDX) have a considerably higher peak arrival capacity than  the other airports in their runway group.  

Peak arrival throughput levels also vary in the two regions. Whereas in Europe peak arrival  throughput is usually close to the peak declared capacity, in the US peak arrival throughput  tends to be substantially lower than the peak capacity arrival rates, with the exception of a few  high impact airports (i.e, New York airports, Philadelphia) where demand and, therefore,  throughput is closer to the peak capacity level. As schedule limitations dictate a close adherence  of scheduled operations to pre-allocated airport slots (a surrogate for capacity), the slot- controlled airports in the US and Europe tend to show a peak throughput closer to peak  capacity.  

There are a number of key challenges in providing a true like-with-like comparison of airport  capacities and throughput for the two regions. One difficulty in this exercise is that airports  within each active runway group may not be directly comparable due to differences in runway  layout. Munich (MUC), having two parallel independent runways and the highest throughput in  its two-runway class, is not directly comparable to LaGuardia (LGA), which also has two active  runways, but in a dependent crossed configuration. The throughput values for the two airports  are, therefore, very different.  

More analysis is needed to better group and compare European and US airports based on  runway layout, runway dependency, and mixed and single mode operations. Another difficulty is  that throughput is highly sensitive to demand. High demand drives high throughput and vice- versa. It is difficult to properly assess throughput as demand levels are lower on both sides of  the Atlantic with some airports having larger demand drops than others. Lastly, measuring  throughput is dependent on the time interval used for the assessment. In this analysis, peak  throughput was measured every five minute rolling hour. Results using a different approach may  reveal a difference not seen at the five minute rolling hour level.  

Many of the differences in performance appear to be attributable to the effects of capacity  variation between most favourable and least favourable conditions. Also, many of the  improvements at the system level observed over time track with an overall decrease in demand.  

The analysis in this section seeks to quantify capacity changes using the performance sources  described in Section 1.3. Changes in capacity can in part be tied to changes in demand, weather,  and airport infrastructure. In Figure 3-11, the average hourly arrival ATC acceptance rates for the  34 main US airports between 6AM-10PM local time are shown with the percent change in arrival  capacity compared to 2013 (top of Figure 3-11).  

![](images/5a3ac37e299704b455aede575125e99e3719248ded2fe4fec0fd18d27f53c33a.jpg)  
Figure 3-11: Average hourly arrival rates at 34 main US airports (2013-2015)  

Ft. Lauderdale (FLL) had the largest percent change from 2013 to 2015.  Its increase was due to a  runway coming back into service in November of 2014. Salt Lake City (SLC) saw a decrease due to  a change in strategy for calling a balanced rate.  

Capacity at airports can be tied to demand at the facility and also be impacted by external  factors, such as weather conditions. It is also the case that not all capacity variation and  performance changes can be explained by meteorological conditions as facilities may operate at  low capacity rates during good weather due to other events such as temporary runway  maintenance or dependencies with traffic flow of nearby airports.  

For this reason, it is more straightforward to assess capacity variation using a percentile method  that does not depend on a link to all the causal reasons described above.  

Figure 3-12 combines the various elements (volume, capacity reduction, and frequency) which  drive performance at US airports using percentiles. In the previous section, peak capacity and  throughput values were presented. In the following section, the focus is on how much capacity  varies from low to high values and how often this variation becomes a strain on airports due to  demand levels close to or exceeding capacity. Note that capacity and demand do not have to be  at a peak level for an airport to be impacted or strained. In general, it only takes a mismatch of  the two entities and not necessarily high levels of each.  

Figure 3-12 combines various elements of capacity and demand, calculated using filed times  from day of operation, as one means of measuring the congestion at airports as well as the  predictability of capacity. The top chart in Figure 3-12 shows airport capacity and demand for  both 2013 and 2015 by reporting the average number of hours the demand is greater than   $80\%$    of the called rate capacity for the airport.  For example, LGA experienced a demand greater than  the   $80^{\mathrm{{th}}}$   percentile capacity for 12.4 hours per day on average during 2015.  This means for the  majority of the operating day, LGA’s demand exceeded the   $80^{\mathrm{{th}}}$   percentile capacity.  In relation  to Figure 3-9, the operations at Seattle have not only increased but by this indicator, are  becoming more comparable to the busier US airports.  While Fort Lauderdale traffic has grown,  its congestion by this measure is less due to one of its runways coming back into service.  

To capture this effect, a percent capacity reduction metric can be used by calculating the   $(85^{\mathrm{th}}$  -  $15^{\mathrm{{th}}})/85^{\mathrm{{th}}}$  . This metric in the lower part of Figure 3-12, shows the percent capacity variability by  calculating the percent decrease in capacity from the   $85^{\mathrm{{th}}}$  to   $15^{\mathrm{{th}}}$   percentile.  This metric  produces similar results for LGA (low variability, low capacity) and CLT (high variability, high  capacity). Philadelphia (PHL), Boston (BOS), Detroit (DTW), and Nashville (BNA) report the largest  percent capacity reductions of the Main 34 airports.  

![](images/0c6eaa72429a275615f1f3bc820e1599ffaa3625491d07584f7e262212c2ee2e.jpg)  
Figure 3-12: Capacity variation and impact on operations at US airports  

Although a percentile method was used to characterise airport capacity variation, it is still  important for performance analysis groups to link these changes to causal factors. At this time, it  is difficult to apply a practical automated process that can explain capacity variation across all  facilities. For example, it is known that for San Francisco (SFO), variation can be tied to  precipitation, haze, fog and other METAR cloud cover conditions which are not captured by  ceiling/visibility alone. For Philadelphia (PHL), the capacity variation can be linked to wind effects  [Ref. 10]. Additional performance data development and automated procedures are needed to  assess these effects across airports.  

A key challenge for ATM is to ensure safe operations while sustaining a high runway throughput  in the various weather conditions. Even small improvements at high density airports will yield a  considerable benefit for airspace users and the entire network. This will encompass the use of  new and enhanced technology as foreseen in NextGen and SESAR.  

Runway throughput at airports is usually impacted by meteorological conditions. As weather  conditions deteriorate, separation requirements generally increase and runway throughput is  reduced. The impact of weather (visibility, wind, convective weather, etc.) on operations at an  airport and hence on ATM performance can vary significantly by airport and depends on a  number of factors such as, inter alia, ATM and airport equipment (instrument approach system,  radar, etc.), runway configurations (wind conditions), and approved rules and procedures.  

As illustrated in Figure 3-13,  movement  rates  depend  on  visibility  conditions.  Runway  throughput can drop significantly  when Low Visibility Procedures   $(\mathsf{L}\mathsf{V}\mathsf{P})^{29}$    need to be applied.  

LVPs require increased spacing  between aircraft to maintain the  signal integrity of the Instrument  Landing System (ILS) which in turn  reduces throughput.  

![](images/1fb8d0a4becba09a1cb32885c72014b399bdefdf60b72aaa96178d7ea06f5236.jpg)  
Figure 3-13: Impact of visibility conditions on runway throughput  

Wind conditions also impact runway throughput. With the separations based on distance, wind  with a high headwind component lowers the ground speed of aircraft and consequently reduces  the rate at which aircraft make their final approach.  

The analysis of performance by meteorological condition provides an indication of how weather  affects system performance and which airports are most impacted by changes in weather  condition.  

Section 3.3.1 provides an assessment of weather in the two regions using general criteria for  ceiling and visibility. Section 3.3.2 compares ATFM delay attributed to weather causes at US and  European arrival airports.  

3.3.1   M EASURING WEATHER CONDITIONS  

Both US and European performance groups use detailed weather observation reports known as  30 METAR  and both groups have developed procedures for assessing weather’s impact on  aviation performance [Ref. 11 and 12]. A typical METAR contains data on temperature, dew  point, wind speed and direction, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and barometric  pressure.  

Historically, many of the performance analysis indicators and modelling processes at the FAA  segregate time periods into visual or instrument meteorological conditions (VMC/IMC). This  provides a simple first-order examination of the effects of weather on performance using ceiling  and visibility as the primary criteria for defining weather. Performance by VMC/IMC was also  examined in the previous benchmark reports as a practical way of comparing weather changes  over time and weather differences between facilities.  

Precise definitions differ between the US and Europe but for the analysis in the next section, a  cloud ceiling of less than 1 000 feet or visibility of less than 3 miles   $(5~\mathsf{k m})$   was used for the  demarcation of IMC. Conditions better than IMC are termed visual meteorological conditions  (VMC). In addition, there are airport specific thresholds where visual approaches (and typically  visual separations) may be used.  Conditions below such thresholds, but still better than IMC, are  referred to as Marginal VMC. For simplicity, the following thresholds were used for  all airports  to  provide a basic assessment of the frequency of various weather conditions.  

![](images/d9cda9c59d9db0872e8498282fccb1a902b820f65b14693ff9f92340f5b9ffd8.jpg)  

It is important to note that VMC does not necessarily equate to favourable or perfect weather  although it is often the case. METAR data contains records with weather events, such as rain  showers, thunderstorms and strong winds occurring during periods with high visibility and clear  skies. These weather events are currently not assessed as part of these related indicators and  more work is needed in the future to develop a more comprehensive definition for weather.  

Figure  3-14  shows  the  percent of time spent in  visual,  marginal,  and  instrument  conditions  in  Europe and the US at system  level in 2013 and in 2015  between 6AM-10PM local  time.  

In  general,  weather  in  Europe at system level is  less favourable than the US.  

![](images/ccf2072055883743a7bd80b6f77b3c7efa04c4240e6c0b624e00db09fbe1ca27.jpg)  

In 2015,   $84.5\%$   of the year at the main 34 US airports was spent in VMC with   $9.5\%$   occurring in  marginal and   $6\%$   in instrument conditions. Overall, the weather in the US appears to be similar  as in 2013 with a slightly higher frequency of IMC in 2015   $(+0.2\%)$  . The main 34 European  airports spend on average   $77.8\%$   of the time in VMC,   $14.2\%$   in marginal, and   $8\%$   in instrument.  At system level, weather conditions in Europe improved in 2015 compared to 2013 with a   $-2.0\%$    reduction in IMC and a   $-1.8\%$   reduction in marginal conditions.  

At the airport level, the share of time spent in VMC, MMC, and IMC vary based on differing  susceptibility to weather events which is largely based on geographic location (Figure 3-15). The  European airports located in the subtropical Mediterranean region including Nice (NCE), Palma  (PMI), Madrid (MAD), Rome (FCO), Athens (ATH), and Barcelona (BCN) are the airports with the  highest percentage of the VMC.  

![](images/66e32f9379ebbc394a0e5743a66e2016e7251096f180e5148d20035c2460e7dc.jpg)  
Figure 3-15: Percent of time by meteorological condition at the main 34 airports (2015)  

In the US, Las Vegas (LAS) and Phoenix (PHX) rarely experience anything other than VMC with  their dry desert climate. Similarly, the Florida airports (FLL, MCO, TPA, and MIA) also spend a  high percentage of time in VMC.  

Figure 3-16 shows how the change in instrument conditions is broken down by airport in Europe   $(-2\%)$   and the US   $(+0.2\%)$   in 2015. In terms of performance, the observed capacity gap, traffic  volume, and frequency of IMC drive overall system performance.  

![](images/3d91df32fe6bff297107971e302f5b82cbe7b7bf7291164751606e762a14ba8b.jpg)  
Figure 3-16: Percent change in time during IMC at the main 34 airports (2013-2015)  

The airports with considerably more time spent in marginal and instrument conditions and less  time in VMC may call lower called rates more often, but performance at these airports will only  be impacted if demand levels rise above the available capacity. As mentioned previously in this  section, ceiling and visibility provide only a preliminary step towards measuring weather  conditions.  More work is needed to relate the impact of weather conditions on airport and air  traffic performance.  

# 3.3.2   W EATHER - RELATED AIRPORT  ATFM  DELAYS AT THE MAIN  34  AIRPORTS  

As weather is a major factor influencing runway throughput and airport capacity, airports  typically issue ATFM restrictions to address capacity to demand imbalances when adverse  weather occurs. Using comparable data sources in the US and Europe, this section provides a  preliminary analysis of the specific types of weather-related causes for ATFM delays at the  arrival airport. A more detailed analysis of ATFM delay for all causal factors is provided in Section  5.2.1.  

31 Figure 3-17 shows the average airport arrival ATFM delay  by causal factor at system level for  the main 34 airports between 2008 and 2015.  

![](images/768cf957e7348488bc68ea7690d2d76ab4eb842382f56d91c6738f04b9b73f2f.jpg)  

Overall, relatively higher ATFM delays per arrival are observed in the US compared to Europe  when weather-related restrictions are present. This may be due to European capacities being set  more conservatively to allow for unforeseeable events whereas the US operates by calling a  higher capacity by presuming ideal operating conditions. Major contributors to the US values  include airports with high demand and highly variable capacity.  

In Europe, ATFM airport regulations due to visibility are the main driver of delay, followed by  wind, winter operations and thunderstorms. A notable exception is observed for 2010 where  winter operations were the main cause for weather related airport ATFM regulations. As can be  seen in Figure 3-17, average weather related ATFM arrival delays increased in Europe between  2013 and 2015.  

Similarly in the US, the primary driver for ATFM delays is visibility, however, the impact of  thunderstorms and severe weather are also very prominent. Different than in Europe, weather  related airport ATFM delays continuously decreased in the US between 2013 and 2015.  

Figure 3-18 provides a breakdown of weather-related ATFM delay by arrival airport and by cause  in 2015. A high average weather-related airport arrival delay is usually the result of a notable  capacity reduction in bad weather combined with a high level of demand (i.e. peak throughput  close to or higher than the declared capacity).

Figure 3-18: Airport charged weather-related ATFM delays by destination airport (2015)  

As can be seen from the figure, a few notable US airports experience delay levels that are  magnitudes higher than other airports in the country or in Europe. The New York area airports  (EWR, LGA, and JFK) experience very high average ATFM weather-related delays. For this reason,  the New York area has implemented a severe weather avoidance plan (SWAP) to handle aircraft  reroutes and departure clearances during thunderstorm events. On the west coast, fog and low  visibility are the most impactful weather cause for ATFM delays at San Francisco (SFO).  

In Europe, London Heathrow (LHR) shows the highest impact of weather on operations in 2015,  followed by Amsterdam (AMS), Zurich (ZRH), and Geneva (GVA). The average weather-related  airport arrival ATFM delays at London (LHR) were mainly related to wind and visibility.  

# 4. COMPARISON OF AIRLINE-RELATED OPERATIONAL SERVICE QUALITY  

This chapter compares US and European performance using data provided by airlines. Specific  KPIs provided in this section include airline-reported punctuality, airline-reported delay against  the schedule, airline-reported attributable delay, and phase of flight time variability.  

The section starts with a high level evaluation of the share of delayed flights compared to airline  schedules, which is often used as a proxy for “service quality”. There are many factors  contributing to the “service quality” of air transport. In fact, it can be seen as the “end product”  of complex interactions between airlines, ground handlers, airport operators, and ANSPs, from  the planning and scheduling phases up to the day of operation.  

The KPI is reported by the US Department of Transportation [Ref.13] and in Europe by the  Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA) [Ref. 14]. The chapter furthermore assesses trends in  the evolution of scheduled block times as changes in this scheduled time can have a first order  effect on punctuality KPIs. The main delay drivers are also identified by analysing the information  32 reported by airlines in order to get a first estimate of the ATM-related  contribution towards  overall air transport performance.  

# 4.1   On-time performance  

Figure 4-1 compares the industry-standard indicators for on-time performance, i.e. arrivals or  departures delayed by less than or equal to 15 minutes versus schedule. The results need to be  seen together with the time buffers included in airline schedules in order to achieve a certain  level of on-time performance.  A more detailed discussion on how increasing block time can lead  to an apparent improvement in performance is included in the next section (see Section 4.2).  

![](images/903d7ca284515916f990861e264d12f5f72bfe5fcebbfc5a8ebeedd88c2561b8.jpg)  
Figure 4-1: On-time performance (2005-2015)  

A notable difference was the gap between departure and arrival punctuality that occurred prior  to 2010 in the US, and which was not observed for Europe. The reasons for this gap are not fully  understood but may involve policy, differences in flow management techniques as well as other  incentives to have high on-time departures. While in the US, flow management strategies focus  more on the gate-to-gate phase, in Europe flights are usually held at the gates with only  comparatively few constraints once an aircraft has left the gate.  However from 2010 this gap  has largely disappeared with a trend similar to Europe.  

Historically, between 2005 and 2007, on-time performance degraded in the US and in Europe  and improved notably between 2007 and 2009. It is interesting to note that, at system level,  traffic in Europe increased by   $2.3\%$   while traffic in the US declined by   $11.8\%$   between 2005 and  2009 (compare Figure 3-1).  

Whereas in the US performance remained stable in 2010, punctuality in Europe degraded to the  worst level on record mainly due to weather-related delays (snow, freezing conditions) and  33 strikes . From 2010 to 2012, punctuality in Europe improved again and continued to improve in  the US. However in 2013 and 2014, whereas punctuality in Europe remained largely unchanged  and then degraded from 2014-2015, punctuality in the US saw a sharp decline from 2012-2014  followed by a rebound from 2014-2015. Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-3 show the facilities that most  influence system wide on-time performance as well as contributed to the change from 2013- 2015 (US  $80.2\%$   vs   $81.3\%$  ).  

The system-wide on-time performance is the result of contrasted situations among airports.  Figure 4-2 shows the arrival punctuality at the 34 main European and US airports in 2015. The  changes in arrival punctuality compared to 2013 are shown in Figure 4-3  

In the US, the New York airports (LGA, EWR, JFK) had the lowest on-time performance (arrivals),  followed by San Francisco (SFO) and Los Angeles (LAX). Compared to 2013, only a few airports  showed degradation in arrival punctuality (see Figure 4-3).  

![](images/20b0f7fba4d9d4409cc5d61c3f2ddf28a06ee679a58a2d89d7b836572f20c019.jpg)  
Figure 4-2: Arrival punctuality at the main 34 airports (2015)  

In Europe, the two London airports (LHR, LGW) and Dublin (DUB) had the lowest level of arrival  punctuality in 2015 (top chart in Figure 4-2). Compared to 2013, Paris (ORY)   $(+4.9\%$   pt.) showed  the highest improvement and a notable deterioration can be observed for London (LGW), Rome  (FCO) and Dublin (DUB).  

![](images/830d516730c15ea2a24c2462d33950efe4c106daff3c08b2a1b1d1e43c6096a4.jpg)  
Figure 4-3: Change in arrival punctuality at the main 34 airports (2015 vs. 2013)  

Figure 4-4 shows monthly arrival punctuality levels (red line) together with traffic levels (brown  line) for flights to or from the top 34 airports in the US and Europe between 2010 and 2015.  

![](images/46250b104b06268779378b48d755bab2e7ec7b80c666709cc3f306d041f9d894.jpg)  
Figure 4-4: Arrival punctuality by month (2010-2015)  

In Europe and the US, a clear pattern of summer and winter peaks is visible. Whereas the winter  peaks are more the result of weather-related delays at airports, the summer peaks are driven by  the higher level of demand and resulting congestion but also by convective weather in the en- route airspace in the US and a lack of en-route capacity in Europe. The strong increase in Europe  in December 2010 is due to exceptional weather conditions (ice & snow).  

As already mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, it is important to understand that on-time  performance is the ‘end product’ of complex interactions involving many stakeholders, including  ATM. Arrival punctuality is influenced by departure punctuality at the origin airport and often by  delays which already occurred on previous flight legs (see also Section 4.3). Depending on the  type of operation at airports (hub & spoke versus point to point) and airline route itinerary, local  performance can have an impact on the entire network through ripple effects but also on the  airport’s own operation.  

Hence, there are interdependencies between ATM performance and the performance of other  stakeholders and/or events outside the control of ATM which require a high level of cooperation  and coordination between all parties involved. This may include competing goals within airlines,  weather, or changes to airport infrastructure that affect capacity.  

# 4.2   Airline scheduling  

On-time performance can be linked to a number of different factors including traffic levels,  weather, airport capacity, and airline scheduling preferences, such as schedule peaks and  scheduled block times. Frequently, airlines may pad their schedules to achieve a higher level of  on-time punctuality. The inclusion of “time buffers” in airline schedules to account for a certain  level of anticipated travel time variation on the day of operations and to provide a sufficient  level of on-time performance may therefore mask changes in actual performance (see grey box).  

Generally speaking, the wider the distribution of historic  block-to-block times (and hence the higher the level of  variation), the more difficult it is for airlines to build  reliable schedules resulting in higher utilisation of  resources (e.g. aircraft, crews) and higher overall costs.  

Additionally, a number of airlines operate hub and spoke  systems that interconnect flights to and from spoke  airports to the carriers’ hubs. Therefore disturbances at  one hub airport can quickly propagate through the entire  airline schedule. Operating an aircraft servicing several  airports can further amplify and increase the delay  propagation.  

#   Airline scheduling  

Airlines build their schedules for the next  season on airport slot allocation (mainly  Europe), crew activity limits, airport  connecting times, and by applying a  quality of service target to the distribution  of previously observed block-to-block  times (usually by applying a percentile  target to the distribution of previously  flown block times).  

The level of “schedule padding” is subject  to airline strategy and depends on the  targeted level of on-time performance.  

Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that efficiency improvements in actual flight time  distributions do not automatically result in improved on-time performance, as the airline  schedules for the new season are likely to be reduced by applying the punctuality target to the  set of improved flight times (block times are cut to improve utilisation of aircraft and crews).  

Figure 4-5 shows the evolution of airline scheduling times in Europe and the US. The analysis  compares the scheduled block times for each flight of a given city pair with the long-term  34 average for that city pair over the full period (DLTA metric ). Generally speaking, the scheduled  block times follow the pattern of the actual block times of the previous season.  

At system level, scheduled block times remained largely stable in Europe with only a slight  increase between 2008 and 2010 and again as of 2012. In the US, average block times increased  continuously between 2005 and 2010 but decreased again between 2010 and 2015. In 2015  average block times increased again notably in the US which could be due to the degraded  punctuality observed in 2014 (see Figure 4-1).  These observed increases in schedule padding in  the US may result from adding block time to improve on-time performance or could be tied to a  tightening of turnaround times. More work is needed on a city pair level to accurately and more  specifically identify the numerous factors influencing the changes in on-time performance.  

![](images/74037d90c47f66b78ca07caa3e64b5b42d7b0a3e2e63722dd72eaeded0bd3b9b.jpg)  

Seasonal effects are visible in Figure 4-5 with scheduled block times being on average longer in  winter than in summer. US studies have shown that the majority of the increase is explained by  stronger winds on average during the winter period [Ref. 15].  

# 4.3   Drivers of air transport performance – as reported by airlines  

This section aims at identifying underlying delay drivers as reported by airlines in the US and in  Europe. The reported delays relate to the schedules published by the airlines.  

A significant difference between the two airline data collections is that the delay causes in the  US relate to the scheduled arrival times whereas in Europe they relate to the delays experienced  at departure. Hence, for the US the reported data also includes variability from further delays or  improvements in the en-route and taxi phase, which is not the case in Europe.  

Broadly, the delays in the US and in Europe can be grouped into the following main categories:  Airline   $^+$  Local turnaround, Extreme Weather, Late arriving aircraft (or reactionary delay),  Security, and ATM system (ATFM/NAS delays):  

 Airline   $^+$   Local turnaround: Delay due to circumstances within local control including airlines or other parties, such as ground handlers involved in the turnaround process (e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fuelling, etc.). As the focus of the paper is on ATM contribution, a more detailed breakdown of air carrier  $^+$   local turnaround delays is beyond the scope of the paper.  

 Extreme Weather: Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecast) that in the judgment of the carrier, delays or prevents the operation of a flight such as icing, tornado, blizzard, or hurricane. In the US, this category is used by airlines for very rare events like hurricanes and is not useful for understanding the day to day impacts of weather. Delays due to non-extreme weather conditions are attributed to the ATM system in the US.  Late-arriving aircraft/reactionary delay: Delays on earlier legs of the aircraft that cannot be recuperated during the turnaround phases at the airport. Due to the interconnected nature of the air transport system, long primary delays can propagate throughout the network until the end of the same operational day.  Security: Delays caused by evacuation of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment, and/or other security related causes.  ATM System: Delays attributable to ATM refer to a broad set of conditions, such as non- extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, ATC.  

Figure 4-6 provides a breakdown of primary delay drivers in the US and Europe. Only delays  larger than 15 minutes compared to schedule are included in the analysis. Clearly, US airlines  attribute a larger fraction of causal delay to US ATM than what is seen in Europe.  

![](images/9a025cfc734dd6b1132cae0d3431d621aaa98e998d7718bff30236360b7cc301.jpg)  

In the US, ATM system delay is largely due to weather which is attributed to the ATM system and  equipment problems. In Europe, according to airline reporting, much of the primary delay at  departure is not attributable to ATM but more to local turnaround delays caused by airlines,  airports, and ground handlers.  

As already mentioned, the US distribution relates to the scheduled arrival times and the higher  share of ATM-related delay at arrival is partly due to the fact that this figure is impacted by ATM  delays accrued after departure (i.e taxi-out, en-route, terminal).  

It should be noted that the ATM system related delays in Figure 4-6 result from not only en- route and airport capacity shortfalls but also include weather effects which negatively influence  ATM and aircraft operations (IMC approaches, convective weather). According to FAA analysis,  by far the largest share of ATM system related delay is driven by weather in the US [Ref. 16].  

Figure 4-7 provides an analysis of how the duration of the individual flight phases (gate  35 departure delay , taxi-out, airborne, taxi-in, total) have evolved over the years in Europe and  the US. It is based on the DLTA Metric (see footnote 34) and compares actual times for each city  pair with the long-term average for that city pair over the full period (2005-2015). For example,  in the US at the peak of the curve at the end of 2008, total average actual flight time among city  pairs had increased over 5 minutes since 2005 and was 4 minutes above the long-term average.  

![](images/2dd09b0b605575e34d07740d9d01663ad95e91e8faf29f580a3435922ae01cc8.jpg)  
Figure 4-7: Trends in the duration of flight phases (2005-2015)  

In Europe, performance is clearly driven by gate departure delays with only very small changes in  the gate-to-gate phase (i.e. there is only a very small gap between departure time and total). The  drop in gate departure delay in 2009 when traffic levels fell as a result of the economic crisis is  significant. In 2010, despite a traffic level still below 2008, gate departure delays increased again  significantly mainly due to exceptional events (industrial actions, extreme weather, technical  upgrades). Since 2010, performance in almost all phases of flight improved again substantially.  

In the US, the trailing 12-month average began to decline at the beginning of 2008. Similar to  Europe, departure delay was the largest component associated with the change in average flight  time. Between 2008 and 2010, most flight components went back to their long-term average  and improved even further between 2010 and 2012 before they decreased again in 2014-2015.  A substantial improvement is also visible for taxi-out times as a result of the initiatives to  improve performance in this area.  

# 4.4   Variability by phase of flight  

This section looks at the Key Performance Area of  Predictability or variability by phase of flight using  airline-provided data for gate “out,” wheels “off,”  wheels “on,” and gate “in” data. This out, off, on, in  data is often referred to as OOOI data and is almost  entirely collected automatically using a basic airline  data-link system (see Section 1.3 for more information  on data sources).  

Due to the multitude of variables involved, a certain  level of variability is natural. However, variations of  high magnitude and frequency can become a serious  issue for airline scheduling departments as they have to  balance the utilisation of their resources and the  targeted service quality.  

![](images/c1445a4258c37ac773076bee7709d810f16c0a89cc96a46e0e5c5d56c0071371.jpg)  

Variability  

The “variability” of operations determines the  level of predictability for airspace users and  hence has an impact on airline scheduling. It  focuses on the variance (distribution widths)  associated with the individual phases of flight  as experienced by airspace users.  

The higher the variability, the wider the  distribution of actual travel times and the more  costly time buffer is required in airline  schedules to maintain a satisfactory level of  punctuality.  Reducing the variability of actual  block times can potentially reduce the amount  of excess fuel that needs to be carried for each  flight in order to allow for uncertainties.  

Predictability evaluates the level of variability in each phase of flight as experienced by the  36 airspace users . In order to limit the impact from outliers, variability is measured as the  difference between the 85th and the 15th percentile for each flight phase. This captures   $70\%$   of  flights and would be representative of one standard deviation if in fact travel times were  normally distributed and not skewed due to delay. In targeting high levels of punctuality, airlines  may in fact require “certainty” around a broader population of flights than   $70\%$   and therefore  view the system as more “variable” and less predictable than what is shown below. However,  the focus on this report is to compare the US and Europe using a common methodology.  

Figure 4-8 shows that in both Europe and the US, arrival predictability is mainly driven by gate  departure predictability. Variability in all flight phases is higher in the US than Europe.  

![](images/e5ca38976d3b0ecfb80c6e44ba0d30f07f9ec4ea82050191c616996a3a16f775.jpg)  
Figure 4-8: Variability of flight phases (2005-2015)  

Between 2005 and 2007, gate departure time variability continuously increased on both sides of  the Atlantic. Contrary to Europe, variability increased also in the taxi-out phase in the US, which  appears to be driven by the different approaches in both scheduling operations and absorbing  necessary delay.  

Historically, the differences between the US and Europe have been largest on the ground both at  the gate and in taxi-out. Despite the lower level of variability, improvement in the gate-to-gate  phase – especially in the taxi-out and terminal airborne phase – can warrant substantial savings  in direct operational and indirect strategic costs for the airlines.  

Figure 4-9 shows a clear link between the various seasons and the level of variability in the US  and in Europe. The higher variability in the winter is mainly due to weather effects. The higher  airborne flight time variability in the winter in the US and in Europe is caused by wind effects and  also partly captured in airline scheduling (see Figure 4-5).  

![](images/fea61e3a113a56dd7f6a494c5042fc55206357f8322d1fd1cf1787595c66aa1d.jpg)  

In the departure phase, ATM can contribute to the variability through ATM-related departure  holdings and subsequent reactionary delays on the next flight legs. The ATM-related departure  delays are analysed in more detail in Section 5.2.1. Due to the interconnected nature of the  aviation system, variability originating at constrained airports can propagate throughout the  entire network.  

The gate-to-gate phase is affected by a multitude of variables including congestion (queuing at  take-off and in TMA), wind, and flow management measures applied by ATM.  

For the airborne phase of flight, it is important to note that wind can have a large impact on day- to-day predictability compared to a planned flight time for scheduling purposes. Understanding  the ATM, airline, and weather influences on predictability is a key element of baselining system  performance. The strong jet stream winds in the winter and convective weather in the summer  impact overall predictability statistics.  

At US airports, winter delays are believed to be driven to some extent by the higher frequency of  instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) combined with scheduling closer to visual  meteorological conditions (VMC). Summer delays result from convective weather blocking en- route airspace. The high level of variability may be related to scheduling and seasonal  differences in weather.  

In Europe where the declared airport capacity is assumed to be closer to IMC capacity, the  overall effects of weather on operational variability are expected to be generally less severe.  

After a high level analysis of operational performance from the airline point of view, the next  chapter provides an assessment of performance evaluated from the ATM perspective. The  following analysis of ATM-related service quality is indicative of what can be influenced by  improvements or actions taken by the ANSP.  

# 5. COMPARISON OF ATM-RELATED OPERATIONAL SERVICE QUALITY  

Although the analysis of performance compared to airline schedules (on-time performance) in  Section 4.1 is valid from a passenger point of view and provides valuable first insights, the  involvement of many different stakeholders and the inclusion of time buffers in airline schedules  require a more detailed analysis for the assessment of ATM performance.  

This section compares US and European performance using Key Performance Indicators  calculated using data available to the ANSP. Specific KPIs include ATM-reported attributable  delay, flight plan additional distance, and additional time in the various phases of flight including  taxi-out, en-route, descent and arrival, and taxi-in.  

The evaluation of ATM-related operational service quality will focus on the Key Performance  Areas of efficiency of actual operations by phase of flight in order to better understand the ATM  contribution and differences in traffic management techniques between the US and Europe. The  KPA of environmental sustainability is addressed as it relates to efficiency when evaluating  additional fuel burn.  

The FAA-ATO and EUROCONTROL have been sharing approaches to performance measurement  over the past years. Both have developed similar sets of operational key performance areas and  indicators. The specific key performance indicators (KPIs) used in this report were developed  using common procedures on comparable data from both the FAA-ATO and EUROCONTROL (see  Section 1.3).  

# 5.1   Approach to comparing ATM-related service quality  

Figure 5-1 shows the conceptual framework for the analysis of ATM-related service quality by  phase of flight applied in the next sections of this report. The high level passenger perspective  (on-time performance) is shown at the top together with the airline scheduling. The various  elements of ANS performance analysed in more detail in the following sections are highlighted in  blue in Figure 5-1.  

![](images/23cdf92be8137cb738377dc7a71484ae1bd754a6580889983a2cdfa7e35714b5.jpg)  
Figure 5-1: Conceptual framework to measuring ATM-related service quality  

The evaluation of ATM-related service quality in  the remainder of this report focuses on the  Efficiency (time, fuel) of actual operations by  phase of flight (see information box).  

ATM may not always be the root cause for an  imbalance between capacity and demand (which  may also be caused by other stakeholders,  weather, military training and operations, noise  and environmental constraints, etc.).  

However, depending on the way traffic is  managed and distributed along the various  phases of flight (airborne vs. ground), ATM has a  different impact on airspace users (time, fuel  burn, costs), the utilisation of capacity (en-route  and airport), and the environment (emissions).  

The overarching goal is to minimise overall direct  (fuel, etc.) and strategic (schedule buffer in the  form of added block time, etc.) costs whilst  maximising the utilisation of available en-route  and airport capacity.  

While maximising the use of scarce capacity,  37 there are trade-offs  to be considered when  managing the departure flow at airports (holding  at gate vs. queuing at the runway with engines  running).  

#   Efficiency  

‘Efficiency’ in this report measures the difference  between actual time/distance and an unimpeded  reference time/distance. “Inefficiencies” can be  expressed in terms of time and fuel and also have an  environmental impact.  

Due to inherent necessary (safety) or desired (noise,  capacity, cost) limitations the reference values are not  necessarily achievable at system level and therefore  ATM-related ‘inefficiencies” cannot be reduced to  zero.  

![](images/6804fe0ec642465c835028381c7f0cc6dfdb7e0b3eafb6a845d722edcda75edf.jpg)  

Similarly, the management of arrival flows needs to find a balance between the application of  ground holding, terminal airborne holdings and en-route sequencing and speed control [Ref. 17].  

# 5.2   ATM-related efficiency by phase of flight  

Efficiency generally relates to fuel efficiency or reductions in flight times of a given flight. The  analyses in this chapter consequently focus on the difference between the actual travel times  and an optimum time of the various phases of flight illustrated in Figure 5-1. For the airborne  phase of flight, this “optimum” may be a user-preferred trajectory which would include both the  vertical and horizontal profile.  

5.2.1   ATM-R ELATED  D EPARTURE RESTRICTIONS  ( GROUND HOLDING )  

Both the US and Europe report delay imposed  38 on flights  by the ANSP in order to achieve  required levels of safety as well as to most  effectively balance demand and capacity.  

ATFM departure delays can have various  ATM-related (ATC capacity, staffing, etc.) and  non-ATM related (weather, accident, etc.)  reasons.  

The categories of delay cause codes differ in  the US and Europe; however, five general  categories were developed to encompass the  varying causal factors (see grey box). Both  systems track the constraining facility which  allows delay to be reported as either due to  terminal/airport or en-route constraints.  

Figure 5-2 shows average total ATFM ground  delay (en-route and terminal) per flight  between 2008 and 2015.   More detailed  analyses of causal reasons for changes  between 2013 and 2015 are provided in later  figures for both US and Europe.  

For comparability reasons, only flights with  ATFM ground delays equal or greater 15  minutes were included in the analyses .  

![](images/03502226ba645a75637d81b31e734604b04a828d3aa81ad86727fa4eee37ff04.jpg)  

![The table shows how the differing delay codes for EU and  US were mapped to produce the analysis in this section.  ](images/b87da1bd504edbef3d538c7e6d8acc8e053c2c397ef81d4d6e129fd5bff7618c.jpg)  

The delays are calculated with reference to the estimated take-off time in the last submitted  flight plan (not the published departure times in airline schedules).  

In Europe, average ATFM delay  continuously  decreased  until  2013, following the historically  bad  performance  due  to  weather and strikes in 2010.  

Between 2013 and 2015, total  ATFM ground delays equal or  greater 15 minutes increased in  Europe by   $43.4\%$   whereas traffic  only increased by   $4.1\%$   during  the same time.  

![](images/eb6dce6f11bb608aaf829d48f7c8797944b08d11232a4a68e45396e72c77dc02.jpg)  

The US has also shown a decline  since 2008.   Some of this  

improvement can be attributed to improving local weather at SFO and declining traffic levels at  key facilities such as ORD and PHL as shown in Chapter 3. Between 2013 and 2015, total ATFM  delay decreased by   $12.7\%$   with  overall traffic levels at the main  34 held constant.  

Figure 5-3 shows this change  from 2013 to 2015 by causal  factor. In the US, the decrease  between 2013 and 2015 was  largely due to weather including  en-route convective weather not  quantified in Chapter 3.  

In  Europe,  the  notable  performance deterioration was  due to a significant increase in  capacity related delays and to a  lesser extent due to weather.

# Figure 5-3: Percent change in ATFM delay by cause (2015 vs. 2013)  

Table 5-1 compares ATM-related departure restrictions imposed in the two ATM systems due to  en-route and airport constraints. As can be expected, the share of flights affected by departure  ground restrictions at origin airports differs considerably between the US and Europe. Despite a  reduction from  $5.0\%$   in 2008 to   $2.0\%$   in 2015, flights in Europe are still over twice more likely to  be held at the gate or on the ground for en-route constraints than in the US where the share of  flights was  $0.8\%$   in 2015.  

![Table 5-1: ATFM departure delays (flights to or from main 34 airports within region)  ](images/9400b57d013893fffcb39a9c5f0ef2fe9a4b877c75ae9c6ca22d6a73673b8445.jpg)  

For airport related delays, the percentage of delayed flights at the gate or on the surface is  slightly higher in the US than in Europe. However, the delay per delayed flight in the US is   $55\%$  higher (51 vs. 33).  

Whereas in the US, en-route  delays are mostly driven by  convective  weather,  in  Europe they are mainly the  result of capacity and staffing  constraints (including ATC  industrial actions) driven by  variations in peak demand  (see  large  differences  between summer and winter  in Europe in Figure 3-4 and  Figure 3-5).  

At system level, the causes  for  airport-related  ATFM  delays are similar in both the  US and Europe. Weather is  the predominant driver of  ATFM delays in both Europe  and the US (Figure 5-5).

# Figure 5-6 compares the  

average minutes of airport-related ATFM departure delays attributed to the constraining  destination airport. The airports are sorted in descending order by number of ATFM delay  minutes; however, airports with a high number of flights will show lower average ATFM delays.  

![](images/55b2f642af0607facc123eb85d115c0e0adf7905530cc3256d72e49da13b74b9.jpg)  
Figure 5-6: Airport charged ATFM delay by destination airport (2015)  

In Europe, delays are more evenly spread across airports with Amsterdam (AMS), London (LHR),  and Zurich (ZRH) generating the highest amounts of airport ATFM delay in 2015 in absolute  terms.  

For the US, approximately   $70\%$   of the total delay minutes are concentrated at six airports in the  US: New York (LGA), Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and  Philadelphia (PHL). From Figure 5-6, it can be seen that flights to New York-LaGuardia (LGA) have  an average ATFM delay which is four times higher than London Heathrow (LHR). Figure 5-6 also  shows the facilities the drove the overall 2013-2015 reduction with ORD and EWR contributing  the most followed by SFO and PHL. During this time, SFO gained an improved ability to run  reduced separation under converging operations and lower minimums. Los Angeles (LAX), which  experienced increased traffic, contributed the most to increasing system wide ATFM delay.  

The difference in ATFM strategy between the US and Europe is clearly visible. In the absence of  en-route sequencing in Europe, reducing ATFM delays (by releasing too many aircraft) at the  origin airport when the destination airport’s capacity is constrained potentially increases  airborne delay (i.e. holding or extended final approaches). On the other hand, applying excessive  ATFM delays risks under util is ation of capacity and thus, increases overall delay.  

More analysis is needed to see how higher delays per delayed flight are related to moderating  demand with “airport slots” in Europe.  

# 5.2.2   ATM- RELATED  T AXI - OUT EFFICIENCY  

This section aims at evaluating the level  of inefficiencies in the taxi-out phase.  The analysis of taxi-out efficiency refers  to the period between the time when the  aircraft leaves the stand (actual off-block  time) and the take-off time. The  additional time is measured as the  average additional time beyond an  unimpeded reference time.  

![](images/e14b734488de35de601bbfaab9bd69eba45d2701b30e79c5033fc6b192c0c2e7.jpg)  

In the US, the additional time observed in the taxi-out phase also includes some delays due to  local en-route departure and MIT restrictions. In Europe, the additional time might also include a  small share of ATFM delay which is not taken at the departure gate, or some delays imposed by  local restriction, such as Minimum Departure Interval (MDI).  

The taxi-out phase and hence the performance indicator is influenced by a number of factors  such as take-off queue size (waiting time at the runway), distance to runway (runway  configuration, stand location), downstream departure flow restrictions, aircraft type, and remote  39 de-icing, to name a few. Of these aforementioned causal factors, the take-off queue size  is  considered to be the most important one for taxi-out efficiency [Ref. 18].  

Although the impact of ANSPs on total additional time is limited when runway capacities are  constraining departures, in Europe, Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) initiatives try  to optimise the departure queue by managing the pushback times.  

The aim is to keep aircraft at the stand to reduce additional time and fuel burn in the taxi-out  phase to a minimum by providing only minimal queues and improved sequencing at the  threshold to maximise runway throughput. These departure delays at the gate are reflected in  the departure punctuality indicators. However, the ATM part due to congestion in the taxiway  system is presently difficult to isolate with the available data set.  

Two different methodologies  were applied for the analysis  of inefficiencies in the taxi- out time.  

While the first method used  for Figure 5-7 is simpler, it  allows for the application of  a consistent methodology.  The method uses the 20th  percentile of each service  (same operator, airport, etc.)  as  a  reference  for  the  “unimpeded”  time  and  compares it to the actual  times. This can be easily  computed  with  US  and  European data.  

![](images/908f250126c87bbdd9306b1bca948b11c0713e40d56ef018bb1112bd17054af5.jpg)  

On average, additional times in the taxi-out phase appear to be higher in the US with a  maximum difference of approximately 2 minutes more per departure in 2007. Between 2008  and 2012, US performance improved continuously while European performance only improved  gradually which narrowed the gap between the US and Europe.  

Although the gap notably reduced since 2008, the observed differences in inefficiencies between  the US and Europe are largely driven by different flow control policies and the absence of  scheduling caps at most US airports. Additionally, the US Department of Transportation collects  and publishes data for on-time departures which could add to the focus of getting off-gate on  time.  

In 2015, both European and US performance deteriorated. The increase in additional taxi-out  times in the US may be linked to worsening weather conditions for specific areas of the country  or as a result of ATFM delay taken on the ground.  

Seasonal patterns emerge, but with different cycles in the US and in Europe. Whereas in Europe  the additional times peak during the winter months (most likely due to weather conditions), in  the US the peak is in the summer which is most likely linked to congestion.  

The analysis by airport in Figure 5-8 and Figure 5-9 as well as the overview in Figure 5-10 is based  on the more sophisticated methodologies by each of the performance groups in the US and  40 Europe .  

Figure 5-8 shows a more detailed comparison of additional time in the taxi-out phase at the  major airports in Europe and the US which illustrates the contrasted situations among airports.  

![](images/740eb6072e3e860b0b152319723be7c0035ab360417ae59c032cdf6f6eb19b4a.jpg)  
Figure 5-8: Additional time in the taxi-out phase by airport (2015)  

In Europe, the two London airports (LHR, LGW), and Rome (FCO) showed the highest average  additional taxi out time in 2015. On average, London Gatwick (LGW) showed an increase in  additional taxi-out time of almost 2 minutes between 2013 and 2015.  

![](images/bc9926e3323202334d22ef4861833f5119b58c7b3c6677c6db32bf3b27049345.jpg)  
Figure 5-9: Difference in additional time in the taxi-out phase by airport (2015 vs. 2013)  

In the US, the New York airports, Philadelphia (PHL), and Chicago (ORD) showed the highest  average additional time in 2015. In contrast to flights destined for ORD and San Francisco (SFO)  (Figure 5-6), flights departing these airports experienced an increase of delay on departure in the  taxi-out phase. In addition, the Texas airports of Dallas (DFW) and Houston (IAH) contributed to  the increase in system wide taxi-out delay however these airports also had decreases in airline  reported data (OOOI) flights.  Atlanta (ATL) contributed the most to improvement on the system- wide measure. Unlike ORD and SFO, Newark (EWR) showed significant improvement for both  taxi-out delay and for flights destined to EWR (Figure 5-6). Although DTW showed the largest  decrease in traffic from 2013-2015, the improvement shown should be caveated due to  significant changes in the reporting carriers for OOOI data. The most notable performance  improvement for an airport was observed for Fort Lauderdale (FLL). This is attributed to the  increase in declared capacity that occurred with the completed expansion of a runway.  

![](images/1b5f1beb69ac7f127911849ee47df6c9dd17fe1a0b2336896f4295c254ab8c56.jpg)  

Although some care should be  taken when comparing the two  indicators due to slightly differing  methodologies, Figure 5-10 tends  to confirm the trends seen in Figure  5-7.  

Overall, additional times in the taxi- out phase appear to be higher in  the US but the gap closed between  2008 and 2011. As of 2012, the US  performance started to deteriorate  again whereas the performance in  Europe remained largely stable  during the same period.

5.2.3 EN-ROUTE FLIGHT EFFICIENCY  

This section evaluates en-route flight efficiency  in the US and Europe. En-route flight efficiency  indicators assess actual flight trajectories or  filed flight plans against an ideal or benchmark  condition.  

From an operator’s perspective, this ideal  trajectory would be a User-Preferred Trajectory  that would have a horizontal (distance) and a  vertical (altitude) component.  

Ideal altitudes are highly affected by external factors such as aircraft specific weight and  performance as well as turbulence and other weather factors. For this reason, much more  detailed data from airlines and tactical responses to weather would be needed to establish an  efficiency criterion for altitude. Furthermore, the horizontal component is, in general, of higher  economic and environmental importance than the vertical component across Europe as a whole  [Ref. 19]. Nevertheless there is scope for further improvement, and Section 6.2 in this report  provides an initial comparison of vertical flight efficiency in the arrival phase between the US and  Europe which will help to provide a more complete picture in the future.  

The focus of this section is on the horizontal  component of the en-route phase.  Two KPI’s  are reported. The first one compares the  lengths of the en-route section of the last  filed flight plan to a benchmark “achieved  distance” (apportionment of great circle  distance). The second KPI compares actual  trajectories against “achieved distance.”  

For a flight, the “inefficiency” is the difference  between the length of the analysed trajectory 

 (filed flight plan or actual flown) and an 

 “achieved” reference distance (see also grey  box). Where a flight departs or arrives outside  the reference airspace, only that part inside  the airspace is considered.  

“En-route” is defined as the portion between  a 40NM radius around the departure airport  and a 100NM radius around the arrival  airport. The indicator is calculated as the ratio  of the sum, over all flights considered.  

#  Horizontal en-route flight efficiency  

Horizontal en-route flight efficiency compares the length  of flight plan or actual trajectories (A) to the “achieved”  distance (H).  

The achieved distance apportions the Great Circle  Distance between two airports. If the origin/ destination  airport is located outside of the reference airspace, the  entry/exit point into the airspace is used for the  calculation.  

![](images/ae6181e4ee15008989393571d6e81d3d4aa826ff8caefea43868a8c6d88b9543.jpg)  

The refined methodology enables to better differentiate  between local inefficiency (deviations from GCD between  local entry and exit points and the contribution to the  network.  

More information on horizontal en-route flight efficiency  in Europe is available at  www.ansperformance.eu .  

The methodology used for the computation of horizontal en-route fight efficiency in this report  is consistent with the flight efficiency indicators used in the Single European Sky performance  scheme.  

The flight efficiency in the last 100NM before landing which also includes airborne holdings is  addressed in the next section of this report (5.2.4).  

It is acknowledged that this distance-based approach does not necessarily correspond to the  “optimum” trajectory when meteorological conditions or economic preferences of airspace  users are considered for specific flights.  However when used at the strategic level, the KPI will  clearly point to areas where track distance is increasing or decreasing over time.  

O PPORTUNITIES AND  L IMITATIONS TO IMPROVING HORIZONTAL FLIGHT - EFFICIENCY  

While there are economic and environmental benefits in improving flight efficiency, there are  also inherent limitations. Trade-offs and interdependencies with other performance areas such  as safety, capacity, and environmental sustainability as well as airspace user preferences in route  selection due to weather (wind optimum routes), route availability, or other reasons (differences  41 in route charges , avoidance of congested areas) affect en-route flight efficiency.  

En-route flight inefficiencies are predominantly driven by (1) route network design (2) route  availability, (3) route utilisation (route selection by airspace users) and (4) ATC measures such as  MIT in the US (but also more direct routings).  

Although a certain level of inefficiency is inevitable, there are a number of opportunities for  improvement. The following limiting factors should be borne in mind for the interpretation of  the results:  

Basic rules of sectorisation and route design. For safety reasons, a minimum separation  has to be applied between aircraft;  

Systematisation of traffic flows to reduce complexity and to generate more capacity; 

    Strategic constraints on route/ airspace utilisation.  

   Impact of Special Use Airspace (SUA) on flight  efficiency.  

Figure 5-11 illustrates the impact of special  use airspace on horizontal en-route flight  efficiency in Europe in 2015. The filed routes  of the 15 most penalising city pairs  connecting the top 34 airports are plotted in  blue and the actually flown trajectories are  plotted in red. It is clearly visible how flights  have to circumnavigate around SUA (brown  areas). However, it also shows that directs  are being provided by ATC on a tactical basis  which improve flight efficiency in actual  trajectories but which on the other hand  introduce variability in the system.  

![](images/3d221d86cc994251bdc0199e6892b3b654332eb0397130db74dff8849690faca.jpg)  
Figure 5-11: Impact of Special Use Airspace in  Europe (2015)  

   Interactions with major airports. Major terminal areas tend to be more and more  structured. As traffic grows, departure traffic and arrival traffic are segregated and  managed by different sectors. This TMA organisation affects en-route structures as over- flying traffic has to be kept far away, or needs to be aligned with the TMA arrival and  departure structures.  

   Route availability and route planning. Once routes are made available for flight planning,  their utilisation is in the hand of flight dispatchers and flow managers. Many airlines  prepare flight plans based on fixed route catalogues and do not have the tools/resources  to benefit from shorter routes when available. Aircraft operators often rely on tactical  ATC routings.  

   In Europe, en-route flight efficiency is also affected by the fragmentation of airspace  (airspace design remains under the auspices of the States).  

   For the US, the indicator includes the effect of en-route holding and vectoring.  

   Lastly, planned cruise speeds or altitudes are not known by ATC systems and may require  detailed performance modelling or information on airline intent.  

While technologies, concepts, and procedures have helped to further optimise safety, add  capacity, and increase efficiency (e.g. Reduced Vertical Separation Minima, RNAV) over the past  years, it will remain challenging to maintain the same level of efficiency while absorbing forecast  demand increases over the next 20 years.  

Figure 5-12  shows the  evolution of horizontal en- route  flight  efficiency  (actual and flight plan)  compared  to  achieved  distance  between  2008  and 2015.  

An “inefficiency” of   $5\%$    means for instance that  the extra distance over 1  000NM was 50NM.  

Due to data availability, the  KPIs for Europe are only  shown as of 2011.  

![](images/2c844f7e7039e1a4d291a51aa36966305b832c721700dacc50c191e9091060e2.jpg)  
Figure 5-12: Evolution of horizontal flight efficiency (actual and flight plan)  (2008-2015)  

Although much smaller in the US, there is a notable gap between flight plan and actual flight  inefficiency in the US and in Europe.  

The difference between planned and actual operations reveals that in general flights fly more  direct than their flight plan in both systems. This is most likely due to more direct tracks  provided by ATC on a tactical basis when traffic and airspace availability permits.  

In general the US reports less “inefficiency” in this area. Although performance improved in  Europe for both indicators over the past years, European airlines file on average some   $4.6\%$    greater than their achieved distance compared to   $3.4\%$   in the US in 2015. For the US, many of  the heaviest travelled city pairs such as SFO to LAX or Chicago to the New York area both file  direct flight and achieve direct flight for the majority of flights.  

However when actuals are compared, the gap is much more narrow and much less in terms of  an efficiency score. Between 2011 and 2014 there was a continuous improvement in Europe in  terms of flight efficiency for flights to and from the top 34 airports, which narrowed the gap.  However, flight efficiency deteriorated in Europe in 2015.  

A CTUAL TRAJECTORY VS .   A CHIEVED  D ISTANCE  

The level of total horizontal en-route flight inefficiency   $\scriptstyle{[(\mathsf{A}-\mathsf{H})/\mathsf{H}]}$   for flights to or from the main  34 airports in Europe in 2015 was   $2.92\%$   compared to   $2.83\%$   in the US.  Overall, horizontal en- route flight inefficiency on flights to or from the main 34 airports in Europe is approximately   $0.1\%$   higher than in the US in 2015.  In assessing the US trends, much of the increase from 2013- 2014 can be traced to large additional distance incurred due to the effects of the fire at Chicago  Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZAU) that predominantly affected flights from September 26 –  October 12 of 2014.  The overall increase that can be observed from 2013-2015 is directly linked  to airports (and city pairs) that experienced increases in traffic levels (SEA, LAX and DAL).  

![](images/0d68f9c00033fcf8a1da84a06139c12fa090e8957a521db5dd02958eb880432a.jpg)  
Figure 5-13: Direct en-route extension by destination airport  

US airports show some clustering and patterns when values are summed by destination airport,  particularly for New York Area and Florida airports. In assessing specific city pairs for these  facilities, three causal reasons emerge. These include 1) Traffic into New York Area especially  from Texas and Florida, 2) Effects of Special Activity Airspace on East Coast and around San  Francisco and 3) Transcontinental Flights.  

Almost all direct flights between the New York area and Florida airports would require flight  through special use airspace. Many of the flights to East Coast and West Coast airport  destinations involve long transcontinental flight where large values do not translate into high  percentages. Furthermore, these transcontinental flights require much more scrutiny as the  ideal flight would consider winds and not be limited to direct flight.  

Lastly, existing route design into the New York area does not allow for direct flights for some key  city pairs (DFW and IAH to New York Area). This may be due to congestion caused by high traffic  and the presence of major airports located close together. Alternatively, it may be possible to fly  more direct to the New York area as the FAA makes continued improvements to airspace design  and more advanced traffic flow management is implemented.  

In absolute terms, the average additional mileage in the US is higher due to the longer flights but  in relative terms the level of flight inefficiency is lower (i.e. inefficiency per flown distance).  

Figure 5-13 also provides insight into the facilities that contributed the most to the changes from  2013-2015. For the US, the routes that had the largest impact directly related to the airports that  show the largest increase in traffic over this time period including Los Angeles (LAX), Seattle  (SEA) and Dallas Love Field (DAL).  

As traffic and the underlying network  changed, the increase is a product of both  increasing distance and the distribution of  flights among the network.  

For Dallas Love Field (DAL), this was  significant with the expiration of the Wright  Amendment in 2014 which allowed for many  more city-pair services to DAL. Key city pairs  contributing to the increase for Seattle (SEA)  include west coast traffic (SAN, LAX and SFO  into SEA).  

Figure 5-14 shows flights tracks for the most  popular filed flight plan (shown in blue) for  SAN/LAX into SEA.  

Improvements to en-route design are, by  definition, a network issue which requires a  holistic, centrally coordinated approach.  Uncoordinated, local initiatives may not  deliver the desired objective, especially if  the airspace is comparatively small.  

![](images/c7e5f95967b7ced16cba3a0e3dbdcdf8fdd09cccac445a1ae4f28d42b04e71cf.jpg)  
Figure 5-14: San Diego/Los Angeles to Seattle flights  affecting horizontal flight efficiency  

In view of the fragmented European ATM system, a harmonised and well-coordinated  implementation of initiatives aimed at improving the route network at system level is more  difficult to achieve in Europe than in the US where only one entity is responsible for the  optimisation of the route network.  

As technology for both aircraft and ATC has  advanced, the need for such a rigid en-route  structure has diminished, to the extent that  free-route airspace (FRA) with a positive  effect on flight efficiency would now be  possible throughout Europe (see grey box).  The airspace is undergoing significant  change which requires all stakeholders to  adapt.  

The implementation of free route airspace  mandated by EU legislation aims at  enhancing en-route flight efficiency with  subsequent benefits for airspace users in  terms of time and fuel as well as a reduction  of  $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$   emissions for the environment.  

#  Free Route Airspace (FRA) Concept  

Free route airspace (FRA) is a key development with a view  to the implementation of shorter routes and more efficient  use of the European airspace.  

FRA refers to a specific portion of airspace within which  airspace users may freely plan their routes between an  entry point and an exit point without reference to the fixed  Air Traffic Services (ATS) route network. Within this  airspace, flights remain at all times subject to air traffic  control and to any overriding airspace restrictions.  

Deployment is ongoing, and EU Implementing Regulation  716/2014 (the Pilot Common Project regulation) stipulates  that the Network Manager, air navigation service providers  and airspace users shall operate direct routing (DCT) as  from 1 January 2018 and FRA as from 1 January 2022 in the  airspace for which the EU Member States are responsible at  and above flight level 310 in the ICAO EUR region.  

By the end of 2015, the Network Manager coordinated, through the European Route Network  Improvement Plan (ERNIP) [Ref. 20], the development and/or implementation of more than 20  airspace improvement packages relating to various FRA projects (including Night Routes and  direct routes (DCTs)).  

Figure 5-15 shows Europe-wide free route implementation by the end of 2015. As can be seen  Ireland, Portugal, Hungary and parts of Scandinavia are most advanced in Europe and already  operate 24 hour FRA (Free Route Airspace).

Figure 5-15: Free route development (2015)  

The deployment of Flexible Airspace Management and Free Route functionality needs to be  coordinated due to the potential network performance impact of delayed implementation in a  wide geographical scope involving a number of stakeholders. From a technical perspective the  deployment of targeted system and procedural changes is synchronised to ensure that the  performance objectives are met. This synchronisation of investments involves multiple  civil/military air navigation service providers, airspace users and the Network Manager.  Furthermore, synchronisation during the related industrialisation phase needs to take place, in  particular among the supply industry.  

5.2.4 FLIGHT EFFICIENCY WITHIN THE LAST 100 NM  

This section aims at estimating the level of  inefficiencies  that  occur  during  the  arrival/descent  phase  of  flight.  These  inefficiencies  are  seen  through  larger  downwinds or final, “S-turns” or in the worst  case airborne holding patterns within the last  100 NM of flight.  

For this exercise, the locally defined terminal  

![](images/3e91ea89f8f9c994c20852cadb438f3fce89efc2caa74726bb255d10566b3d68.jpg)  

manoeuvring area (TMA) is not suitable for  comparisons due to variations in shape and size  of TMAs and the ATM strategies and  procedures applied within the different TMAs.  

Hence, in order to capture tactical arrival  control measures (sequencing, flow integration,  speed  control,  spacing,  stretching,  etc.)  irrespective of local ATM strategies, a standard  Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA)  was defined (see grey box for explanation). For  the analyses, the 100NM ring was used.  

ASMA (Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area) is defined  as two consecutive rings with a radius of 40 NM and 100  NM around each airport.  

This incremental approach is sufficiently wide to capture  effects related to approach operations. It also enables a  distinction to be made between delays in the outer ring  (40-100 NM) and the inner ring (40 NM-landing) which  have a different impact on fuel burn and hence on  environmental performance.  

More information and data on additional ASMA time in  Europe is available at  www.ansperformance.eu .  

The actual transit times within the 100 NM ASMA ring are affected by a number of ATM and  non-ATM-related parameters including, inter alia, flow management measures (holdings, etc.),  airspace design, airports configuration, aircraft type environmental restrictions, and in Europe,  to some extent the objectives agreed by the airport scheduling committee when declaring the  airport capacity.  

The “additional” time is used as a proxy for the level of inefficiency within the last 100 NM. It is  defined as the average additional time beyond the unimpeded transit time. The unimpeded  42 times  are developed for each arrival fix, runway configuration and aircraft type combination.  

Figure  5-16  shows  the  evolution of average additional  time within the last 100 NM for  the US and Europe from 2008  to 2015.  

At system level, the additional  time within the last 100 NM  was similar in the two regions  in 2008 but declined in the US  between 2008 and 2010. At the  same time, additional time  within  the  last  100  NM  increased in Europe.

Although at different levels, performance in the US and in Europe remained relatively stable  since 2013.  

However, the picture is contrasted across airports. Figure 5-17 shows the average additional  time within the last 100 NM by airport in 2015. The difference in average additional time within  the last 100 NM by airport is reported in Figure 5-18.

Figure 5-18: Difference in average additional time within the last 100 NM (2015 vs. 2013)  

Europe shows a slight overall increase in 2015. At airport level, London Heathrow (LHR) is a clear  43 outlier , having by far the highest level of additional time within the last 100 NM, followed by  London Gatwick (LGW), Zurich (ZRH), and Madrid (MAD) which show less than half the level  observed at London Heathrow. As seen in Figure 5-18, London Gatwick (LGW) and Dublin (DUB)  were the two European airports with the highest increases in average additional time in the last  100 NM in 2015. A notable decrease in additional time was reported at Frankfurt (FRA) as a  result of the new runway.  

The US levels for average additional time held steady at 2.47 min from 2013 to 2015 with less  contrast in additional time reported among airports. Similar to taxi-out performance, there is still  a notable difference for the airports in the greater New York area, which show the highest level  of additional time within the last 100 NM. A notable increase in additional time within the last  100 NM in 2015 was observed for Boston (BOS), Dallas Love (DAL), with Seattle (SEA) airport  having the largest impact on the system wide trend.  LAX and ORD also contributed to increases  given the large number of operations at the airport. Similar to en-route efficiency, the increases  are largely seen at airports with an increase in operations (SEA, DAL, LAX).  These increases were  balanced at the system level with improvements for Ft. Lauderdale (FLL), Detroit (DTW), San  Francisco (SFO), Newark (EWR) and Chicago (MDW) with Atlanta (ATL) contributing the most to a  system decrease with its large number of operations.  

Due to the large number of variables involved, the direct ATM contribution towards the  additional time within the last 100 NM is difficult to determine. One of the main differences of  the US air traffic management system is the ability to maximise airport capacity by taking action  in the en-route phase of flight, such as in trail spacing. Larger ATFM delay in the US also may  indicate that much of this additional time is pushed back to the departure airport and taken on  the ground.  

In Europe, the support of the en-route function is limited and rarely extends beyond the national  boundaries. Hence, most of the sequencing and holding is done at lower altitudes around the  airport. Additional delays beyond what can be absorbed around the airport are taken on the  ground at the departure airports.  

On both sides of the Atlantic, the operations at high density traffic airports are vulnerable to  adverse weather conditions and cause high levels of delay to airspace users.  

There is a potential trade-off between additional time in terminal airspace (additional ASMA  time) and airport capacity utilisation. This can be observed for London Heathrow (LHR) and the  congested US airports.  Although not quantified in this report, quantifying capacity utilisation  and assessing this trade-off would be a worthwhile subject for further study.  However,  benchmarking the two systems would require a common understanding of how capacity and  throughput is measured for comparable airports.  

Complementary to the analysis of additional ASMA time in this section, section 6.2 of this report  provides an initial comparison of vertical flight efficiency in the arrival phase between the US and  Europe which will help to provide a more complete picture in the future.  

The analysis of taxi-in efficiency in this section  refers to the period between the time when  the aircraft landed and the time it arrived at  the stand (actual in-block time). The additional  time is measured as the average additional  time beyond an unimpeded reference time.  

The analysis in Figure 5-19 mirrors the  methodology applied for taxi-out efficiency in  Figure 5-7.  

![](images/e2c4e0b1f6690f9a94eec7972f5adb4d5777d66300b17a6afad3e029a32c891a.jpg)  

The method uses the 20th percentile of each service (same operator, airport, etc.) as a reference  for the “unimpeded” time and compares it to the actual times. This can be easily computed with  US and European data.  

![](images/2f32e4a618b96d85a784094aa70f597a5681f1a23ccacb95d44b939854bf5075.jpg)  

As can be observed in Figure 5-19, at system level, additional time in the taxi-in phase is higher  in the US than in Europe and remained relatively stable over time in both systems until 2015. For  2015, a notable increase can be observed in the US. Some seasonal patterns are visible  (particularly in the US) where an increase can be noted during summer.  

The taxi-in phase and hence the performance indicator is influenced by a number of factors,  most of which cannot be directly influenced by ATM (i.e. airport/airline staffing, gate availability,  apron limitations etc.).  

The taxi-in phase was included in the comparison for completeness reasons but, due to the  number of factors outside the direct control of ATM, it was not included in the estimated benefit  pool actionable by ATM in Chapter 5.3.  

There is value in developing a systematic  approach  to  aggregating  ATM-related  inefficiencies. Since there are opportunities  for many trade-offs between flight phases,  an overall indicator allows for high-level  comparability across systems.  

This section provides a summary of the  estimated benefit pool for a typical flight,  based on the analysis of traffic from and to  the 34 main airports in Europe and the US.  

![](images/5d7262cf31fe6de3711bcdaf8c6639b8e5ef20c0ffa69c29c7e630c16a623f00.jpg)  

Although included in this report for completeness reasons, due to the number of factors outside  the direct control of ATM, the taxi-in phase was not included in the estimated benefit pool  actionable by ATM.  For the interpretation of the estimated benefit pool actionable by ATM in  this section, the following points should be borne in mind:  

   Not all delay is to be seen as negative. A certain level of delay is necessary and sometimes  even desirable if a system is to be run efficiently without under util is ation of available  resources. 

    Due to the stochastic nature of air transport (winds, weather) and the way both systems  are operated today (airport slots, traffic flow management), different levels of delay may  be required to maximise the use of scarce capacity. There are lessons however to be  learned from both sides. 

    A clear-cut allocation between ATM and non-ATM related causes are often difficult. While  ATM is often not the root cause of the problem (weather, etc.) the way the situation is  handled can have a significant influence on the distribution of delay between air and  ground and thus on costs to airspace users (see also Table 5-2 on page 70).   

    The approach measures performance from a single airspace user perspective without  considering inevitable operational trade-offs, and may include dependencies due to  environmental or political restrictions, or other performance affecting factors such as  weather conditions.  

    ANSP performance is inevitably affected by airline operational trade-offs on each flight.  The indicators in this report do not attempt to capture airline goals on an individual flight  basis. Airspace user preferences to optimise their operations based on time and costs can  vary depending on their needs and requirements (fuel price, business model, etc.).  

    Some indicators measure the difference between the actual situation and an ideal (un- congested or unachievable) situation where each aircraft would be alone in the system  and not subject to any constraints. This is the case for horizontal flight efficiency which  compares actual flown distance to the great circle distance. Other indicators, such as  ASMA flight efficiency, compare actual performance to an ideal scenario that is based on  the best performance of flights observed in the system today. More analysis is needed to  better understand what is and will be achievable in the future.  

However, when used at a strategic level, the indicators do provide clear indications of regions,  city-pair markets and facilities where additional time and distance are increasing or  decreasing.  In this way, ANSPs have a clear and stable procedure for identifying the constraints  in their system, as well as a means of benchmarking performance on a global level.  

By combining the analyses for individual phases of flight in Section 5.2, an estimate of the 

 “improvement pool” actionable by ATM can be derived. It is important to stress that this 

 “benefit pool” is based on a theoretical optimum (averages compared to unimpeded times),  which is not achievable at system level due to inherent necessary (safety) or desired (capacity)  44 limitations . Moreover, the inefficiencies in the various flight phases (airborne versus ground)  have a very different impact on airspace users in terms of predictability (strategic versus tactical  – percent of flights affected) and fuel burn (engines on versus engines off).  

Table 5-2 provides an overview of the ATM-related impact on airspace users’ operations in terms  of time, fuel burn and associated costs.  

![Table 5-2: Impact of ATM-related inefficiencies on airspace users’ operations  ](images/3f73a0a6525de310fc4a77a448ddd60c88090aa6a4d1b74880381ccf110ac1aa.jpg)  

For ATM-related delays at the gate (ATFM/TMI departure restrictions) the fuel burn is quasi nil  but the level of predictability in the scheduling phase for airspace users is low as the delays are  not evenly spread among flights. Hence, the impact of those delays on on-time performance and  associated costs to airspace users is significant but the impact on fuel burn and the environment  45 is negligible. It is however acknowledged that – due to the first come, first served principle applied at the arrival airports - in some cases aircraft operators try to make up for ground delay  encountered at the origin airport through increased speed which in turn may have a negative  impact on total fuel burn for the entire flight.  

ATM-related inefficiencies in the gate-to-gate phase (taxi, en-route, terminal holdings) are  generally more predictable than ATM-related departure restrictions at the gate as they are more  related to inefficiencies embedded in the route network or congestion levels which are similar  every day or season to season. From an airspace user point of view, the impact on on-time  performance is usually low as those inefficiencies are usually already embedded in the scheduled  block times by airlines. However, the impact in terms of additional time, fuel, associated costs,  and the environment is significant.  

The environmental impact of ATM on climate is closely related to operational performance  which is largely driven by inefficiencies in the 4-D trajectory and associated fuel burn. There is a  close link between user requirements to minimise fuel burn and reducing greenhouse gas  46 emissions .  

Clearly, keeping an aircraft at the gate saves fuel but if it is held and capacity goes unused, the  cost to the airline of the extra delay may exceed the savings in fuel cost by far. Since weather  uncertainty will continue to impact ATM capacities in the foreseeable future, ATM and airlines  need a better understanding of the interrelations between variability, efficiency, and capacity  utilisation.  

Previous research [Ref. 21] shows that at system level, the total estimated benefit pool  actionable by ATM and associated fuel burn are of the same order of magnitude in the US and  Europe (approx.  $6–8\%$   of the total fuel burn).  

Figure 5-20 shows a summary of the operational performance on flights to or from the top 34  airports in the US and in Europe for four of the key indicators addressed in more detail in the  previous sections of the report.  

![](images/f7839d3b7ae3404f5d3de8d1448342e8ca2bb2445792aeeba1b89525bdf2c558.jpg)  
Figure 5-20: Evolution of operational performance in US/Europe between 2008 and 2015  

Building on the results shown in Figure 5-20, Table 5-3 summarises the current best estimate of  the ATM-related impact on operating time. Actual fuel burn depends on the respective aircraft  mix (including mix of engines on the same type of aircraft, operating procedures) and therefore  varies for different traffic samples.  

For comparability reasons, the estimated benefit pool actionable by ATM in Table 5-3 is based on  the assumption that the same aircraft type performs a flight of 450NM in the en-route phase in  the US and the European ATM system (see also grey box for more information).  

Although in a context of declining traffic, system- wide ATM performance improved considerably in  the US and in Europe over the past five years.  The resulting savings in terms of time and fuel in  both ATM systems had a positive effect for  airspace users and the environment.  

The distribution of the estimated benefit pool  along the phase of flight is consistent with the  differences in flow management strategies  described throughout the report.  

The improvement in Europe over the past five  years was mainly driven by a reduction of en- route ATFM delay at the departure gates and  improvements in the level of horizontal flight  efficiency.  

As outlined in Section 3.1, the two ATM systems differ  in terms of average flight lengths and aircraft mix (see  Figure 3-6 on page 26).  

Those differences would lead to different results, as  the “inefficiencies” depend on travelled distance and  aircraft type.  

For comparability reasons, the calculations in Table  5-3 are based on averages representing a “standard”  aircraft in the system.  

The calculations assume that a standard aircraft  travels an average distance of 450NM in each ATM  system.  

The typical average fuel burn, was equally applied to  the US and Europe (Taxi   $\approx$  15kg/min., Cruise.≈  46kg/min., TMA holding  $41\upmathrm{kg/min.}$  ).  

![Table 5-3: Estimated benefit pool actionable by ATM (2015 vs. 2010)  ](images/2b90e5259a6bfd0dbfd0b2e9cc81c0ee6b4a45fcf03409b1fdc0671c8f79e2c6.jpg)  

It is an open research question on whether current performance databases capture the full  benefit pool as there may be additional efficiencies gained from using ideal cruise speeds or  from making operations more predictable. Estimating these inefficiencies would require more  information on aircraft performance and airline intent than is currently available to both groups.  

Inefficiencies in the vertical flight profile for en-route and in the TMA departure phase (40NM  ring around the departure airport) were not considered in the benefit pool. Vertical flight  efficiency was addressed in a specific focus study (see Section 6.2) with a view to include it in  future benefit pool estimations in order to get an even more complete picture.  

However, just as there are facets of the benefit pool not covered, there are system constraints  and interdependencies that would prevent the full recovery of the theoretical optimum  identified in this section.  Performance groups will need to work with all stakeholders to quantify  these contrasting effects on the fuel benefits actionable by ATM.  

# 6.   SUPPORTING STUDIES  

This chapter introduces two supporting studies aimed at expanding the scope and level of  analysis of this US/Europe comparison report. Initial results are presented on the  

   Analysis of air traffic flow and capacity management; and     Vertical flight efficiency in the arrival phase.  

Both studies demonstrated the general feasibility of the researched approach and offer  opportunities to augment future editions of the benchmarking report.  

# 6.1   Analysis of Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management in the U.S. and in Europe  

6.1.1   I NTRODUCTION  

In 2015, FAA and Europe initiated a joint study to evaluate the more complex performance  issues associated with ATFCM.  This section reports progress and results with work expected to  continue. The general objective of this study is to deepen the understanding of Capacity  Management (CM) and Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB) methods used in the US and Europe,  and to better understand the differences and similarities between both regions. The various  aspects of ATFCM that can be considered in such a study are shown in Figure 6-1 below. Past  analysis has mainly focused on quantifying the performance outcome in terms of delays and  flight efficiency. The ATFCM study will broaden this scope by looking at additional aspects shown  on the figure. As a first priority the study has been looking into the application of Traffic  Management Initiatives (TMIs) on both sides of the Atlantic.

Figure 6-1: Overview of ATFCM study areas  

Phase 1 of the study consisted of:  

Conceptual analysis of the various TMI types and their application.     Identification of suitable (comparable) data in US and European data archives to support TMI  analysis. It was decided to base the study on data covering the full calendar year 2015, and  the same geographical scope as used in the US/Europe Comparison Report.  

   Extraction and interpretation of the data.  

   Preparation of the data for benchmarking (mapping US and European data sets to common  terminology).  

The prepared data set contains the following attributes:  

 Metrics:  $\bigcirc$    Number of TMIs   $\bigcirc$    Duration of TMIs, with breakdown into actual duration and cancelled duration   $\bigcirc$    Number of flights impacted, with breakdown into number of flights with TMI  attributable delay   $\geq15$   minutes, number of flights with 1 to 14 minutes delay,  and number of flights without TMI attributable delay  o   Generated delay, with breakdown into delay for flights with TMI attributable  delay  $\geq15$   minutes, and delay for flights with 1 to 14 minutes delay     Dimensions:   $\bigcirc$  TMI type   $\bigcirc$    TMI date   $\bigcirc$    TMI cancellation category (Cancelled Before Start, Cancelled After Start, Not  Cancelled)   $\bigcirc$  Facility which is protected and to which the delay is charged   $\bigcirc$    Reason for the TMI (delay causal factor)  

Phase 1 has been completed and the study is ready to move to Phase 2: data analysis and the  formulation of conclusions. Initial results are presented below.  

6.1.2   G ROUPING OF  TMI S INTO  L EVELS  

For the purpose of the study, TMIs are grouped into four levels:  

   TMI-L1 comprises “latent” TMIs which have been created during the strategic and pre- tactical ATFCM phases. They affect scheduling and/or flight planning. Examples: airport slot  reservation programs, route programs and restrictions, permanent altitude segregation. 

    TMI-L2 comprises ATFM TMIs applied on the day of operations, which may result in the  allocation of a take-off slot (ATFM slot) and/or a rerouting, after flight plan filing but in  principle prior to pushback. Examples: Ground Stops (GS), Ground Delay programs (GDP),  Departure Stops (DS), Airspace Flow Programs (AFP), Collaborative Trajectory Options  Programs (CTOP), Severe Weather Avoidance Programs (SWAP), voluntary and required  rerouting. 

    TMI-L3 TMIs are sequencing and metering measures that are used by ATC to fine-tune the  traffic flow and that may have a delay impact on traffic prior to take-off. Examples: Miles In  Trail (MIT), Minutes In Trail (MINIT), Minimum Departure Interval (MDI), Metering (Time  Based Metering, TBM), Departure/En-route/Arrival Spacing (DSP, ESP, ASP). 

    TMI-L4 TMIs are longitudinal (sequencing and metering, including airborne holding), lateral  (load balancing) and vertical (level off) tactical measures that are used by ATC after take-off  with the objective to fine-tune the traffic flow.  

TMI-L1 has not been quantitatively analysed in the study.  

TMI-L2 is well covered by data available in both the US and Europe. Most of the benchmarking  focuses on this level. A limitation of the US data is that the measured TMI impact only includes  delay from flights delayed by 15 minutes or more (reportable delay). The European data contains  the same, but in addition also the number of flights and the associated delay of flights delayed  1 to 14 minutes, and all other flights ‘captured’ by the TMI but without any delay attributable to  the TMI.  

TMI-L3 and TMI-L4 are covered by the US data set, but for Europe such data was not present in  the data used for the study. US TMI-L4 data covers airborne holding. In addition US data is  available on the departure delay of flights not otherwise involved in a TMI. Such departure  delays are attributed to conditions at the departure airport, and are associated with longer than  normal taxi times or holding at the gate.  

In the subsequent sections the terms ‘delayed flight’ and ‘delay’ refer to (flights with) reportable  delay   $(\geq15$   minutes) unless otherwise specified. Likewise, unless otherwise specified all numbers  49 refer to annual values for 2015, within the geographical scope of the study .  

Reportable delay in the US (minutes and percentage)  

![](images/40ddf22b3c88c891e8a14d7256cad5d8744244ac503ad17d8fb0df2ca8eaa023.jpg)  
Figure 6-2 Reportable delay in the US (minutes and percentage)  

In the US,  $75\%$   of the delay is generated by ATFM (TMI-L2), mostly by GDPs;   $8\%$   by TMI-L3 (with  MIT taking   $38\%$   of that share);  $6\%$   by TMI-L4 (airborne holding, generating nearly twice as much  delay as MIT), and   $11\%$   coming from departure delays. On average the delay per delayed flight is  61 minutes for TMI-L2, and less than half of that for TMI-L3, TMI-L4 and departure delay (26, 24  and 24 min respectively).  

6.1.4   R EROUTING AND  L EVEL  C APPING  TMI S IN  E UROPE  

In addition to grouping into levels, TMI types are categorised according to their primary purpose:  

 Delay    Rerouting and level capping.  

Although the focus of the study was on Delay TMIs, it was possible to look at rerouting and level  capping because ATFM regulations in Europe are used for both purposes.  

Rerouting and level capping are used when a section of airspace has significantly decreased  capacity or is predicted to have excessive occupancy.  

In the US, reroutes are issued as an Advisory from the ATCSCC. The analysis of archived  Advisories was not yet part of the current study scope. Hence no results on rerouting in the US  are available at this stage.  

In Europe, for each area expected to have a critical demand/capacity imbalance, a number of  flows may be identified for which other routings may be suggested, that follow the general  scheme, but avoid the critical area. These measures are known as scenarios. There are four  types:  

   Level capping scenarios (FL): carried out by means of zero-rate ATFM regulations with level  restrictions, or through dynamic routing restrictions (e.g. RAD restrictions, EURO  restrictions). 

    Rerouting scenarios (RR): diversion of flows to off-load traffic from certain areas;  implemented by means of zero-rate ATFM regulations or through dynamic routing  restrictions.  

   Alternative  routing  scenarios  (AR):  alternative  routes  which  are  exceptionally made available to off-load  traffic from certain areas, implemented  by ATFM regulations with a low rate.  The other option is the application of  dynamic routing restrictions.  

   EU Restrictions: restrictions that affect  the flight planning phase based on route  or airspace closures.  

The rerouting (RR), level capping (FL) and  Alternative Routing (AR) scenarios which are  implemented through the ETFMS show up in  the data as ATFM regulations with an RR, FL  or AR suffix in their name. In 2015, 6670  ATFM regulations (  $21\%$   of all European  regulations) and  $19.6\%$   of all actual TMI time  were for rerouting and level capping  purposes in 2015. As the RR and FL  regulations force traffic to fly around the  protected area, they do not generate delay  and the data does not show any delayed  or captured traffic.

Figure 6-3 ATFM regulations in Europe  

The average actual duration of rerouting  

and level capping TMIs is slightly longer than for delay TMIs: 2.7 hrs vs. 2.6 hrs. However when  TMIs are initially created, the delay TMIs are on average longer, with more delay TMI time  cancelled (0.6 hrs/TMI) than rerouting TMI time (0.1 hrs/TMI).  

When broken down by TMI type,   $68\%$   of the rerouting and level capping TMIs are for level  capping (FL),   $30\%$   for rerouting (RR) and only   $2\%$   are for alternative routing (AR). The average FL  duration   $(2.3\,\mathsf{h r s/T M I})$   is significantly shorter than the average RR duration (3.8 hrs/TMI) and the  average AR duration (4.7 hrs/TMI).  

# 6.1.5 US/EUROPE COMPARISON OF TMI-L2 (DELAY TMIS ONLY)  

Figure 6-4 visualises the application of ATFM TMIs (TMI-L2) in the US and Europe. For  comparison purposes, all values have been normalised to index 100 for Europe, meaning that  the US values show the relative magnitude compared to Europe. The remainder of the section  explains the differences in terms of absolute values.  

![](images/b5f3121bebbcdfcefd95e53e9a6db6271e369a8fbc1b3e1a767af67d7bfe239e.jpg)  
2015 US/Europe comparison of TMI-L2 (delay TMIs only)  

TMI-L2 generates 10.8 million delay minutes in the US, and 9.3 million delay minutes in Europe:   $12\%$   more delay for   $56\%$   more total traffic (15.3 vs 9.8 million flights), which corresponds to 0.71  minutes reportable delay per flight in the US, vs 0.95 in Europe. When interpreting these  numbers please bear in mind that this only covers ATFM delay (TMI-L2) of flights delayed by 15  minutes or more, and does not encompass certain other delay such as TMI-L3 in Europe for  which no data was available.  

A remarkable observation is that in the US all of this TMI-L2 delay is imposed on 178 000 Flights   $(1.16\%$   of all flights, 61 minutes delay per delayed flight) and in Europe on 304 000 flights   $(3.10\%$  of all flights, 31 minutes delay per delayed flight). To generate this delay, the US uses  approximately 3 470 TMIs annually, whereas Europe uses more than seven times more (24 957  TMIs). The average actual duration of these TMIs is 3.0 hrs/TMI in the US, vs 2.6 hrs/TMI in  Europe (comparable, the US TMIs being only   $15\%$   longer). Relating TMI duration to the number  of delayed flights, we observe that 17.3 flights per TMI-hour are delayed in the US, vs 4.7 in  Europe (3.7 times more). On average TMIs in the US generate 1 054 minutes delay per TMI-hour,  vs 145 in Europe (more than 7 times more).  

In summary, when not looking at tactical TMI-L3 and TMI-L4 flow restrictions, at annual level  ATFM generates more or less the same amount of delay in the US as compared to Europe.  However the operating practices are quite different: in the US the same delay outcome is  generated with only a fraction of the European number of TMIs, and penalises roughly half of  the flights as compared to Europe, and in relation to total annual traffic nearly three times less.  In other words: ATFM TMIs are used less frequently in the US and affect fewer flights, but when  they are used they penalise far more flights per TMI-hour and the delay per delayed flight is  much higher. Apparently in Europe the delay penalisation is distributed much more evenly and  over a wider population of flights. Continued work on this project will take a closer look at the  reasons for these differences.  

6.1.6   F URTHER WORK  

The results presented above paint a very high level picture. Analysis work is ongoing to develop a  more detailed understanding of US and European Traffic Management Initiatives, i.e. to reveal  differences between:  

 TMI types    TMI cancellation categories     Facility types (airports, terminal airspace, en-route airspace)   TMI reasons    Timing (month, weekday, day…), etc.  

Further analysis will look at the network effects of Traffic Management Initiatives. The practices  to predict and limit network effects when developing a TMI will be investigated and compared.  

The future work will also focus on the capacity management practices to understand differences  and commonalities in the en-route and airport capacity declaration practices, the sector  definition and configuration practices and the sector capacity optimization practices.  

# 6.2   Analysis of vertical flight efficiency in the U.S. and in Europe  

6.2.1   I NTRODUCTION  

Flight efficiency KPIs measure the degree to which airspace users are offered the most efficient  trajectory on the day of operation. So far the focus of assessing trajectory-based flight efficiency  has been on horizontal measures in order to identify opportunities of ATM improvements in the  US and European system. Throughout the recent years the focus has shifted to addresses the  identification and measurement of ATM related constraints on vertical flight profiles. In  particular the analysis of fuel-efficient continuous descent operations has gained a higher  momentum.  

With the recent developments and priorities on the ICAO level continuous descent operations  are identified - inter alia – as one of the key improvement steps to enable various aspects of the 

 “efficiency spectrum”. In particular:  

   Fuel-efficiency – costs: airspace users have a strong interest in operating aircraft in a fuel- efficient manner by avoiding fuel-burn due to ATM/ATC related constraints and hence  directly influencing the operational costs. 

    Environment – emissions: emissions are directly related to fuel-burn. Lower fuel-burn will  accordingly result in lower emissions. In that respect continuous descent operations are also  linked with the   $\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$   footprint of aviation and will support the ambitious goals set out for the  contribution of aviation to the world-wide emissions.  

   Environment – noise: Vertically efficient operations also positively affect the noise contour  at and around airports. With an increasing sensitivity of the non-travelling public to aviation  operations, the positive reduction of descent-related noise contributions can ensure higher  acceptance in terms of traffic growth.  

To address this spectrum the analysis of the vertical flight efficiency is a vital contribution as it  supports the appraisal of the level of implementation of continuous descent operations and  equally, the measurement of constraints imposed by ATC/ATM on such operations. Such  constraints range from airspace and procedure design through tactical interventions by air traffic  controllers, including arrangements between adjacent air traffic units.  

The vertical flight efficiency study aimed at the identification, development, and  parameter iz ation of a common vertical flight efficiency algorithm, the demonstration of the  feasibility of the analysis of vertical flight profiles on the basis of trajectory data, and the  identification of an initial set of common key performance indicators, including the extension of  the “benefit pool” estimates to account for inefficiencies in the vertical profile.  

6.2.2 APPROACH  

The underlying conceptual model of vertical flight operations is an abstraction of the flight  profile in distinct portions (i.e. segments). This profile is based on measured trajectory data (4D  position) of aircraft operations. A trajectory is therefore represented by the time-ordered set of  4D measurements associated to one flight, typically describing the flight path from the airport of  departure to the airport of destination (c.f. Figure 6-5). Based on the jointly agreed criteria for  describing level flight, the trajectory is mapped to level segments for further analysis. The  analysis focused on the arrival phase of a flight in terms of the top-of-descent within a 200NM  radius around the arrival airport.

Figure 6-5 Vertical Flight Profile – Level Segments  

For this initial comparison, the analysis of vertical flight efficiency was performed for the top-ten  of US and European airports in terms of movements in the calendar year 2015. For this subset of  airports the following metrics have been identified:  

   Total level distance (in NM) or associated total level time (in minutes);     Average level distance (in NM) or associated average level time (in minute) per arrival;     Cumulative distribution function of the level distance or time;     Monthly variation of the average level distance or time; and      Variation of the level distance per altitude band.  

While the distance- and time-based metrics report on the same phenomenon, it must be noted  that distance-based metrics are of higher relevance for the ANS community (e.g. procedural  airspace characterized by geographical positions that support the evaluation of ground  distances). Airspace users gain more insight from the time-based measures as these translate  directly into aircraft performance and fuel-burn.  

# 6.2.3   I NITIAL  C OMPARISON  –   L EVEL  D ISTANCE  

For both regions, the analysis of the total distance and time in level flight shows the same  pattern. Airports with a higher share of traffic accrue more total level distance and time. The  direct relationship between level distance and level time in terms of ground speed for the  respective fleet mix confirms this general conclusion. As can be derived from Figure 6-6 (top  row), the total level distance in the US is significantly higher than in Europe with the average of  level distance observed in 2015 for the top ten airports totalling to 8 636 688 NM in the US and  3 027 365 NM in Europe.  

Considering the average level distance for arrivals at the top-ten airports (Figure 6-6 bottom  row) a more accentuated pattern emerges. Interestingly the ranking of the individual airports  changes showing the impact of the number of movements on the determined average level  distance and time.  

![](images/3784fea079deea56dcfdd76ea1f1d52e0745424b2646ba29c59ac5143928fcdc.jpg)  
Figure 6-6 US/Europe Comparison – Vertical Flight Efficiency – Average Level Distance  

This change in ranking is more pronounced in the European case, where also the calculated  numerical average of the local averages changes its ranking. The exact causes for this behaviour Figure 6-6: US/Europe Comparison - Vertical Flight Efficiency - Average Level DistanceFigure 6-6: US/Europe Comparison - Vertical Flight Efficiency - Average Level DistanceFigure 6-6: US/Europe Comparison - Vertical Flight Efficiency - Average Level DistanceFigure 6-6: US/Europe Comparison - Vertical Flight Efficiency - Average Level Distance need to be studied in more detail. For example, in the case of Amsterdam, the higher number of  turbo-props has an impact on the observed airspeed and thus time at level. However, this  observation does not hold for other airports showing a distinct off-set of the average level  distance and average time at level.  

Both in the US and Europe a significant share of the level flight is accrued below FL140. This is  directly linked with the procedural airspace for final approach at the different airports. Nuances  apply for the level bands between FL70 and FL140 that may be linked with specific cut-off  altitudes for operations or hand-overs between adjacent control sectors. Level segments below  FL70 can typically be mapped to procedure altitudes for the local traffic patterns at airports and  the associated vectoring to ensure synchronisation and separation of arriving traffic.  

It follows that for this heavily procedurally characterised portion of the flight, a significant high  level of inefficiencies in the vertical profile applies. This also describes the major challenge and  opportunity for mitigating the inefficiency during this phase of the arrival. Improving the  observed performance in terms of reducing the number of level segments requires advanced  synchronisation and separation of the air traffic. Such benefits can be expected from the  implementation of extended arrival management operations (XMAN) that comprises the  establishment of the arrival sequence much earlier, leading to speed adjustments 150-250 NM  away from the arrival airport.

One defining characteristic of the US/Europe comparison report is the combination of the  analyses of individual phases of flight and the estimation of the “benefit pool”, i.e. the potential  improvements actionable by ANS. Next to a qualitative judgement of the impact on punctuality,  the major focus is on the additional fuel burn that drives airspace users’ costs.  

To provide an initial appreciation of such an impact analysis, the initial comparison for the  chosen subset of airports summarises the potential total fuel savings per arrival (kg fuel, c.f.  Figure 6-7). With the results presented above it follows that improvements in reducing the share  of level segments for approaching aircraft can contribute to a lower fuel-burn by airspace users.  Further research is required to address the relationship between the level of traffic and demand  at the top ten airports, its associated requirements in terms of synchronisation and separation of  aircraft, and the level of implementation of continuous descent operations at these airports.

The results reported are derived for the calendar year 2015 for the top ten of airports in the U.S.  and Europe. Based on the limited subset of airports, the initial results need to be validated for a  wider set of airports (i.e. the 34 airports of this comparison report) and multiple years. The latter  will allow for reporting on trends in the metrics presented. This will be essential to address the  question of the level of implementation of continuous descent operations and to appraise the  respective level of implementation or associated constraints by ANS on airspace user operations.  

The focus of this initial study was on the vertical flight efficiency of the arrival phase.  Conceptually, the approach and metrics presented can be extended to other phases of flight, e.g.  vertical efficiency during the en-route phase or climb-out phase. Accordingly, the findings of this  report can inform a richer set of analyses of the vertical flight efficiency and an associated  extension of the “benefit pool” in terms of gate-to-gate trajectory analysis.  

This report is the 5th in a series of joint ATM operational performance comparisons between the  US and Europe. It represents the 2nd edition under the Memorandum of Cooperation between  the United States and European Union. The harmonized Key Performance Indicators used in this  report provide demonstrated examples of the KPIs listed in the 2016 ICAO Global Air Navigation  Plan (GANP).  The ability to work with harmonized KPIs fosters a unique opportunity for both  groups to learn each other’s strengths and identify opportunities for improvement across all  phases of flight.  

Complementary to the well-established indicators already used in previous versions of the  comparison reports, this edition also features two supporting studies on 1) Air Traffic Flow and  Capacity Management (ATFCM) and 2) Vertical Flight Efficiency in the arrival phase, aimed at  expanding the scope and level of analysis of future reports.  

The first part of the report examines commonalities and differences in terms of air traffic  management and performance influencing factors, such as air traffic demand characteristics and  weather, which can have a large influence on the observed performance.  

Overall, air navigation service provision is more fragmented in Europe with more ANSPs and  physical facilities than in the US. Europe is made up of individual sovereign states. As a  consequence the European study area comprises 37 Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs).  50 Together they operate 62 en-route centres  and 16 stand-alone Approach Control (APP) units  (total: 78 facilities). The US study area (CONUS) has 20 en-route centres supplemented by 26  stand-alone Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) units (total: 46 facilities), operated by  one ANSP.  

Although the US CONUS airspace is   $10\%$   smaller than the European airspace, the US controlled  approximately   $57\%$   more flights operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) with   $24\%$   fewer  full time Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs) than in Europe in 2015. US airspace density is, on  average, higher and airports tend to be notably larger than in Europe.  

In terms of traffic evolution, there was a notable decoupling between the US and Europe in 2004  when the traffic in Europe continued to grow while US traffic started to decline. The effect of the  economic crisis starting in 2008 impacted traffic growth on both sides of the Atlantic. While  traffic in Europe decreased by   $3.3\%.$  , air traffic in the US decreased by   $9.9\%$  between 2008 and  2015 reaching a low of traffic in 2013.  For 2013-2015, the US CONUS experienced traffic growth  of  $1.6\%$  .  

While weekly traffic profiles in Europe and the US are similar (lowest level of traffic during  weekends), the seasonal variation is higher in Europe. European traffic shows a clear peak during  the summer months. Compared to average, traffic in Europe is in summer about   $15\%$   higher  whereas in the US the seasonal variation is more moderate.  

At system level, the US has a notably higher share of general aviation than Europe which  accounted for   $22\%$   and   $3.7\%$   of total traffic in 2015, respectively. In order to improve  comparability of datasets, the more detailed analyses were limited to controlled flights either  originating from or arriving at the main 34 US and European airports. The samples are more  comparable as this removes a large share of the smaller piston and turboprop aircraft (general  aviation traffic), particularly in the US. Air traffic to or from the main 34 airports in Europe and in  the US in 2015 represented some  $64\%$   of all flights.  

There are a number of differences between the two systems. In the US, the Air Traffic Control  System Command Center - which is the equivalent of Network Manager Operations Centre in  Europe, is in a stronger position than its European counterpart with more active involvement of  tactically managing traffic on the day of operations.  

The US also operates with fewer airports applying schedule limitations which may lead to a  better utilization of available airport capacity in ideal weather conditions. The analysis of  meteorological reports suggests that weather conditions at the main 34 airports in Europe are,  on average, less favourable than in the US. In 2015,   $84.5\%$   of the year was spent in visual  meteorological conditions at the main 34 US airports compared to   $77.8\%$   in Europe. Europe  shows more airports operating closer to their declared capacity with more IFR flights per active  runway.  The US operates many airports with complex runways with highly variable capacity and  several are operating at close to peak capacity.   For airports with more than 3 runways, US  declared rates are in general higher than Europe. For Europe, London Heathrow, Frankfurt, and  Paris Charles de Gaulle clearly have demand/capacity characteristics comparable to the slot  coordinated airports in the US.  

Each system has areas that are highly impacted by Special Use Airspace (SUA), often due to  operations of a military nature. For Europe, SUA permeates all regions and adds complexity in  some of the most densely traveled areas of Europe. For the US, those areas are more  concentrated, particularly in coastal regions. The impact of SUA on flight efficiency indicators can  be clearly seen but its unique impact is not quantified in this report.  

Building on established operational key performance indicators, the second part of the  comparison report evaluates operational performance in both systems from an airline and from  an ANSP point of view. The airline perspective evaluates efficiency and predictability compared  to published schedules whereas the ANSP perspective provides a more in depth analysis of ATM- related performance by phase of flight compared to an ideal benchmark distance or time. For  the majority of indicators, trends are provided from 2008 to 2015 with a focus on the change in  performance from 2013 to 2015.  

Punctuality is generally considered to be the industry standard indicator for air transport service  quality. The trend in punctuality was similar in the US and Europe between 2005 and 2009 when  both systems reached a comparable level of around   $82\%$   of arrivals delayed by 15 minutes or  less in 2009. Whereas in the US performance remained stable in 2010, punctuality in Europe  degraded to the worst level on record mainly due to weather-related delays (snow, freezing  conditions) and strikes. From 2010 to 2012, punctuality in Europe improved again and continued  to improve in the US. However in 2013 and 2014, whereas punctuality in Europe remained  largely unchanged, punctuality in the US saw a sharp decline. In 2015 both systems reached  again a similar performance level due to notable improvements in the US and performance  degradation in Europe.  

In Europe and the US, a clear pattern of summer and winter peaks is visible. Whereas the winter  peaks are more the result of weather-related delays at airports, the summer peaks are driven by  the higher level of demand and resulting congestion but also by convective weather in the en- route airspace in the US and by a lack of en-route capacity in Europe.  

While the evaluation of air transport performance compared to airline schedules provides  valuable first insights, the involvement of many different stakeholders and the inclusion of time  buffers in airline schedules limit the analysis from an air traffic management point of view.  

Hence, the evaluation of ATM-related performance in this comparison aims to better understand  and quantify constraints imposed on airspace users through the application of air traffic flow  measures and therefore focuses more on the efficiency of operations by phase of flight  compared to an unconstrained benchmark distance or time.  

In order to minimize the effects of ATM system constraints, the US and Europe use a comparable  methodology to balance demand and capacity. This is accomplished through the application of  an “ATFM planning and management” process, which is a collaborative, interactive capacity and  airspace planning process, where airport operators, ANSPs, Airspace Users (AUs), military  authorities, and other stakeholders work together to improve the performance of the ATM  system.  

# ATM-RELATED DEPARTURE RESTRICTIONS (GROUND HOLDING)  

Ground delays imposed by ATM-related departure restrictions were analysed by constraining  environment (en-route or airport/terminal) and by causal factor (weather, capacity, etc.).  

After the poor performance due to weather and strikes in 2010, average ATM-related departure  delay in Europe decreased again until 2013. Between 2013 and 2015, total ATM-related ground  delays increased in Europe by   $43.4\%$   whereas traffic grew by   $4.1\%$   during the same time. The US  has also shown an improvement since 2008 some of which can be attributed to improving  weather and declining traffic levels. Between 2013 and 2015, total ATM-related ground delay in  the US decreased by   $12.7\%$   (mainly due to fewer weather-related delays) with traffic levels  increasing by   $1.6\%$   during the same time. In Europe, the notable performance deterioration  between 2013 and 2015 was due to a significant increase in capacity/volume related delays and  to a lesser extent due to weather.  

ATM-related ground delay per flight in Europe (en-route and airport) was lower than in the US in  2015 (1.3 vs. 1.6 minutes per flight) but the underlying reasons and the application of ATM- related departure restrictions among facilities differ notably between the two systems. Europe  ascribes a greater percentage of delay to en-route facilities (  ${.43\%}$   of total delay in 2015) while in  the US the large majority is ascribed to constraints at the airport   $(82.1\%$   of total delay in 2015).  

The share of flights affected by ATM-related departure restrictions at origin airports differs  considerably between the US and Europe. Despite a reduction from  $5.0\%$   of all flights in 2008 to   $2.0\%$   in 2015, flights in Europe are still over twice more likely to be held at the gate or on the  ground for en-route constraints than in the US where the share of flights affected by ATM- related departure restrictions was  $0.8\%$   in 2015.  

For airport-related ground delays, the percentage of delayed flights at the gate or on the surface  is slightly lower in Europe than in the US (  $2.3\%$   vs.   $2.5\%$   in 2015). However, with 51 minutes, the  delay per delayed flight in the US is notably higher than in Europe in 2015 (33 mins). In the US,  the airports which make up a large percentage of those delays are airports like New York (LGA),  Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Philadelphia (PHL) which  report a large number of hours with demand near or over capacity and have lower predictability  of capacity.  

Whereas in the US, en-route-related ground delays are mostly driven by convective weather, in  Europe they are mainly the result of capacity and staffing constraints (including ATC industrial  actions) driven by significant variations in demand in some European States during summer. At  system level, the causes for airport-related ground delays are more similar in the US and in  Europe. Weather is by far the predominant driver of ATM-related departure restrictions but  Europe has also a notable share of capacity-related delays.  

# ATM-RELATED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY (GATE-TO-GATE)  

ATM-related flight gate-to-gate efficiency is measured by phase of flight (taxi-out, en-route,  arrival/descent and taxi-in) with reference to a benchmark time or distance.  

Taxi-out efficiency improved continuously between 2007 and 2012 in the US but deteriorated  again by 0.5 minutes per departure between 2012 and 2015. During the same period, with the  exception of 2010 where taxi-out efficiency decreased due to the strong winter, performance in  Europe improved continuously at a moderate rate but also showed a slight deterioration in  2015.  

After a notable closure of the gap between the US and Europe until 2012, the performance gap  is widening again and in 2015 average additional taxi-out time in the US is, on average, some 1.5  minutes higher per departure than in Europe. This is largely driven by different flow control  policies and the absence of scheduling caps at most US airports. Whereas in Europe inefficiency  in the taxi-out phase is more evenly spread among airports, the observed taxi-out performance  in the US was predominantly driven by the New York airports, Philadelphia (PHL), and Chicago  (ORD).  

Horizontal en-route flight efficiency (between a 40NM radius around the departure airport and a  100NM radius around the arrival airport) in filed flight plans and in actual trajectories is still  better in the US than in Europe in 2015. Overall, horizontal en-route efficiency on flights to or  from the main 34 airports in the US is approximately  $0.1\%$   better than in Europe in 2015.  

Although the level of inefficiency in Europe increased again slightly in 2015, there has been a  continuous improvement over the past few years in Europe which resulted in a continuous  narrowing of the gap between Europe and the US. In view of the mandatory deployment of free  route airspace in EU Member States by 2022, the en-route efficiency improvements in Europe  are expected to continue over the next years.  US flight inefficiency as measured by this KPI, also  increased slightly in the 2013-2015 time frame largely driven by airports with increasing traffic.  

Flight efficiency in both systems is affected by a number of factors including, inter alia, route  network design, route availability, flight planning, route charges in Europe, and the number and  location of special use airspace. The level of inefficiency in flight plan and in actual trajectory in  the US and in Europe reveal that both in the US and Europe, airlines fly a shorter distance than  they file. Particularly the large gap between planned and actual trajectories observed in Europe  suggests that more direct tracks are provided by ATC on a tactical basis not considered in filed  flight plans which improves efficiency but at the same time lowers the level of overall  predictability in the network.  

Similar to en-route flight efficiency, the US also continued to show a higher level of efficiency in  the last 100NM before landing. Overall, average additional time within the last 100 NM (Arrival  Sequencing and Maneuvering Area (ASMA)) was similar in the two regions in 2008 but decreased  in the US between 2008 and 2010. At the same time, flight efficiency within the last 100 NM  deteriorated in Europe. Although at different levels, performance in the US and in Europe  remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2015.  

At system level, average additional ASMA time was 2.5 minutes per arrival in the US in 2015  which was 0.4 minutes lower than in Europe. The result in Europe was significantly affected by  London Heathrow (LHR) which had an additional time of 9.5 minutes per arrival - almost twice  the level of London Gatwick (LGW) with 4.9 minutes per arrival in 2015. In the US, efficiency  levels in the terminal area are more homogenous.  

Due to the large number of variables involved, the direct ATM contribution towards the  additional time within the last 100 NM is difficult to determine. One of the main differences of  the US air traffic management system is the ability to maximise airport capacity by taking action  in the en-route phase of flight, such as in trail spacing. In Europe strategies can differ from  airport to airport and the impact of the respective air traffic management systems on airport  capacity utilisation in the US and in Europe was not quantified in this report, but would be a  worthwhile subject for further study.  

Although the direct ATM-related influence is limited, additional time in the taxi-in phase was  included for completeness reasons. The level of efficiency is slightly higher in Europe and  remained relatively stable over time in both systems although there has been an increase in  average additional time between 2013 and 2015.  

# ESTIMATED BENEFIT POOL ACTIONABLE BY ATM  

As there are many trade-offs between flight phases, the aggregation of the observed results  enables a high level comparison of the “benefit pool” actionable by ATM in both systems. For  each flight phase, the benefit pool is computed in terms of additional time and fuel burn as the  inefficiencies in the various flight phases (airborne versus ground) have a different impact on  airspace users. For comparability reasons, the computation was based on the assumption that  the same aircraft type performs a flight of 450NM in the en-route phase in the US and the  European ATM system.  

For the interpretation of the observed results, it is important to stress that the determined  “benefit pool” is based on a theoretical optimum (averages compared to unimpeded times),  which is, due to inherent necessary (safety) or desired (capacity) limitations, clearly not  achievable at system level.  

Although in a context of declining traffic, system-wide ATM performance improved notably in  the US and in Europe between 2010 and 2015. The resulting savings in terms of time and fuel in  both ATM systems had a positive effect for airspace users and the environment.  

The improvement in Europe over the past five years was mainly driven by a notable reduction of  ATM-related departure delay, improvements in taxi-out efficiency, and better en-route flight  efficiency. In this context it is however important to point out that 2010 was a year with  comparatively high delays in Europe due to adverse weather and ATC strikes. The performance  improvement in the US was mainly due to a substantial improvement of taxi-out efficiency,  although average additional time in the taxi-out phase in the US increased again slightly in 2015.  

Overall, the relative distribution of the ATM-related inefficiencies associated with the different  phases of flight is consistent with the differences in flow management strategies described  throughout the report and confirmed by a the more detailed supplementary section addressing  differences in Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management (ATFCM) between Europe and the US.  

In Europe ATM-related departure delays are much more frequently used for balancing demand  with en-route and airport capacity than in the US, which leads to a notably higher share of traffic  affected but with a lower average delay per delayed flight. Moreover the share of en-route- related TMIs in Europe is close to   $50\%$   while in the US more than   $80\%$   of TMIs are airport-related  during 2015.  

Consequently, in Europe flights are over twice more likely to be held at the gate or on the  ground for en-route constraints than in the US. The comparatively small amount of en-route- related TMIs in the US are mostly driven by convective weather whereas in Europe en-route- related TMIs are mainly the result of capacity and staffing constraints with only a smaller share  of weather-related constraints.  

For TMIs related to arrival airport constraints the situation is different. The percentage of  delayed flights at the departure gate or on the surface is slightly higher in the US than in Europe  and the delay per delayed flights in the US is almost twice as high as in Europe. Most of this  delay in the US is generally linked to weather-related constraints at a number of high density  airports including, New York (LGA), Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), San Francisco (SFO), New York  (JFK), and Philadelphia (PHL).  

Overall it can be concluded that the two systems differ notably in the way TMIs are applied. In  the US, TMIs are used less frequently, are mostly airport- and weather-related, and affect fewer  flights, but when they are used the delay per delayed flight is much higher than in Europe.

# ANNEX II - DEMAND CAPACITY BALANCING  

In order to minimize the effects of ATM system constraints, the US and Europe use a comparable  51 methodology to balance demand and capacity . This is accomplished through the application of  an “ATFM planning and management” process, which is a collaborative, interactive capacity and  airspace planning process, where airport operators, ANSPs, Airspace Users (AUs), military  authorities, and other stakeholders work together to improve the performance of the ATM  system.  

![](images/5cc30aa4a8525ced9ccb3959abc3d44c36c57633effe878d7c9dd067b0f3c570.jpg)  
Figure II-1: Generic ATFM process (ICAO Doc 9971)  

This CDM process allows AUs to optimize their participation in the ATM system while mitigating  the impact of constraints on airspace and airport capacity. It also allows for the full realization of  the benefits of improved integration of airspace design, ASM and ATFM.  

The process contains a number of equally important phases:  

   ATM planning     ATFM execution  o   Strategic ATFM  o   Pre-tactical ATFM   $\bigcirc$    Tactical ATFM   $\bigcirc$    Fine-tuning of traffic flows by ATC (shown in Figure  as Optimized operations)     TMIs that have an impact on traffic prior to take-off     TMIs acting on airborne traffic     Post-operations analysis.  

# ATFM   P LANNING  

In order to optimize ATM system performance in the ATM planning phase, available capacity is  established and then compared to the forecasted demand and to the established performance  targets. Measures taken in this step include:  

   reviewing airspace design (route structure and ATS sectors) and airspace utilization  policies to look for potential capacity improvements;     reviewing the technical infrastructure to assess the possibility of improving capacity. This  is typically accomplished by upgrading various ATM support tools or enabling navigation,  communications or surveillance infrastructure;     reviewing and updating ATM procedures induced by changes to airspace design and  technical infrastructure;     reviewing staffing practices to evaluate the potential for matching staffing resources with  workload and the eventual need for adjustments in staffing levels; and     reviewing the training that has been developed and delivered to ATFM stakeholders.  

Such an analysis quantifies the magnitude of any possible imbalance between demand and  capacity. Mitigating actions may then be identified to correct that imbalance. However, before  they are implemented, it is very important to:  

   establish an accurate picture of the expected traffic demand through the collection,  collation, and analysis of air traffic data, bearing in mind that it is useful to:  

o   monitor airports and airspaces in order to quantify excessive demand and  significant changes in forecast demand and ATM system performance targets;  o   obtain demand data from different sources such as:     comparison of recent traffic history (e.g. comparing the same day of the  previous week or comparing seasonal high-demand periods);     traffic trends provided by national authorities, user organizations (e.g.  International Air Transport Association (IATA)); and     other related information (e.g. air shows, major sports events, large-scale  military manoeuvres); and  

   take into account the complexity and cost of these measures in order to ensure optimum  performance, not only from a capacity point of view but also from an economic (and cost- effectiveness) perspective.  

The next phase is built on declared ATC capacity. It aims at facilitating the delivery of optimal  ATM services.  

# US  

The FAA publishes a variety of plans that take a multi- year view on the evolution of the NAS. This includes  for example:  

 Aerospace forecasts  Terminal area forecast    Airport capacity profiles     Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan     National Airspace System Capital Investment Plan  

# Europe  

The European ATM Network Operations Plan  represents a view, at any moment in time, of the  expected demand on the ATM Network at a particular  time in the future and the resources available across  the network, together with a set of agreed actions to  accommodate this demand, to mitigate known  constraints  and  to  optimise  ATM  Network  performance.  

The time-frame of the Network Operations Plan is  medium to short-term, moving into pre-tactical  planning. However, this document is strategically  focussed, listing the medium to short-term activities  that contribute to the safe provision of additional  capacity and improved flight efficiency at European  ATM network level.  

The Plan is developed through the formal Cooperative  Decision Making (CDM) Process established between  the  Network  Manager  and  its  operational  stakeholders and is a consolidation of all network and  local capacity plans to provide an outlook of the  expected network performance for the  next five year  period  by comparing the expected benefit from  planned capacity enhancement initiatives with the  requirements at network and local level, as  determined by the Single European Sky Performance  Framework.  

The objectives of the NOP are:  

   to ensure coordinated planning, execution,  assessment and reporting of all measures agreed  at operational level;      to be used as a tool in the execution of the  network management functions, under the  governance of the Network Management Board  and the Network Directors of Operations;     to assist Network Manager stakeholders, mainly  ANSPs, in carrying out agreed activities towards  enhancing and/or optimising performance;     to provide references for the monitoring and  reporting as a part of Network Management  activities; and,      to ensure formal commitment of all operational  stakeholders towards the implementation of the  agreed measures.  

The document identifies potential bottlenecks and  gives early indications to the European Commission,  Network Manager, States, ANSPs, Airports and Aircraft  Operators for the need to plan better use of existing  resources or, if required, to plan for additional  resources, on network interactions and on the need to  implement improvements coordinated at Network  level.  

# S TRATEGIC  ATFM  

The ATFM strategic phase encompasses measures taken more than one day prior to the day of  operation. Much of this work is accomplished two months or more in advance.  

This phase applies the outcomes of the ATM planning activities and takes advantage of the  increased dialogue between AUs and capacity providers, such as ANSPs and airports, in order to  analyse airspace, airport and ATS restrictions, seasonal meteorological condition changes and  significant meteorological phenomena. It also seeks to identify, as soon as possible, any  discrepancies between demand and capacity in order to jointly define possible solutions which  would have the least impact on traffic flows. These solutions may be adjusted according to the  demand foreseen in this phase.  

The strategic phase includes:  

   a continuous data collection and interpretation process that involves a systematic and  regular review of procedures and measures;     a process to review available capacity; and,     a series of steps to be taken if imbalances are identified. They should aim at maximizing  and optimizing the available capacity in order to cope with projected demand and,  consequently, at achieving performance targets.  

The main output of this phase is the  creation of a plan, composed of a list of  hypotheses  and  resulting  capacity  forecasts and contingency measures.  Some elements of the plan will be  disseminated in aeronautical information  publications. Planners will use them to  resolve  anticipated  congestion  in  problematic areas. This will, in turn,  enhance ATFM as a whole as solutions to  potential issues are disseminated well in  advance.  

Scheduling at airports is not really part of  ATFM, but it is a strategic demand  capacity balancing activity with a time  horizon of several months, and is  therefore included in the table below.  

#  Airport coordination levels  

IATA has defined three levels: 

    A non-coordinated airport (Level 1) is one where the  capacities of all the systems at the airport are adequate to  meet the demands of users. 

    A schedules facilitated airport (Level 2) is one where there is  potential for congestion at some periods of the day, week  or scheduling period, which is amenable to resolution by  voluntary cooperation between airlines and where a  schedules facilitator has been appointed to facilitate the  operations of airlines conducting services or intending to  conduct services at that airport. 

    A coordinated airport (Level 3) is one where the expansion  of capacity, in the short term, is highly improbable and  congestion is at such a high level that:  o   the demand for airport infrastructure exceeds the  coordination parameters during the relevant period;   $\bigcirc$    attempts to resolve problems through voluntary  schedule changes have failed;   $\bigcirc$    airlines must have been allocated slots before they can  operate   at that airport.  

# US  

# Scheduling at airports  

With regard to airline scheduling, only two airports  are slot coordinated (IATA level 3) in the US: JFK and  EWR. However EWR will become Level 2 as of winter  2016. Four airports are schedules facilitated (IATA  level 2): ORD, LAX, MCO, SFO.  

# Europe  

# Scheduling at airports  

In Europe, approximately 100 airports are slot  coordinated (IATA level 3).  

Approximately 70 are schedules facilitated (IATA level  2).  

For DCA and LGA, schedule restrictions are in effect  based on Federal and local regulations.  

STMPs (Special Traffic Management Programs) may be  put in place. These are reservation programs  implemented to regulate arrivals and/or departures at  airports that are in areas hosting special events such  as the Masters Golf Tournament, Indianapolis 500,  Denver Ski Country. STMP reservations provide a long- range planning capability for such events.  

# North American Route Program (NRP)  

The North American Route Program (NRP) specifies  provisions for flight planning at flight level 290 (FL290)  and above, within the conterminous U.S. and Canada.  

It enables flexible route planning for aircraft operating  at FL290 and above, without reference to the ATS  route network, from a point 200 nautical miles (NM)  from their point of departure to a point 200 NM from  their destination. Additional flexibility is available by  utilizing specified Departure Procedures (DP) and  Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STAR) that have  been identified within 200 NM of the airport(s).  

Beyond 200 NM from point of departure or  destination, operators must ensure that the route of  flight contains no less than one waypoint or NAVAID,  per each ARTCC that a direct route segment traverses  and these waypoints or NAVAIDs must be located  within 200 NM of the preceding ARTCC's boundary.  Additional route description fixes for each turning  point in the route must be defined.  

Operators must ensure that the route of flight avoids  active restricted areas and prohibited areas by at least  3 NM unless permission has been obtained from the  using agency to operate in that airspace and the  appropriate air traffic control facility is advised.  

The ARTCCs must avoid issuing route and/or altitude  changes for aircraft which display the remarks “NRP"  except when due to strategic, meteorological or other  dynamic conditions.  They must coordinate with  ATCSCC before implementing any reroute to NRP  flights beyond 200 NM from point of departure or  destination. The ATCSCC has the authority to suspend  and/or  modify  NRP  operations  for  specific  

# Free Route Airspace (FRA)  

In Europe FRA is a specified airspace within which  users may freely plan a route between a defined entry  point and a defined exit point. Subject to airspace  availability, the route can be planned directly from  one to the other or via intermediate (published or  unpublished) way points, without reference to the ATS  route network. Within this airspace, flights remain  subject to air traffic control.  

# Free route operations can be:  

   Time limited (e.g. at night) – this is usually a  transitional  step  that  facilitates  early  implementation and allows field evaluation of  the FRA while minimising the safety risks.      Structurally or geographically limited (e.g.  restricting entry or exit points for certain traffic  flows, applicable within CTAs or upper airspace  only) – this is done in complex airspaces where  full implementation could have a negative  impact on capacity.      Implemented in a Functional Airspace Block  (FAB) environment – a further stage in the  implementation of FRA. The operators should  treat the FAB as one large FIR.      Within SES airspace – this is the ultimate goal  of FRA deployment in Europe.  

# Route Availability Document (RAD)  

The RAD is a common reference document containing  the policies, procedures and description for route and  traffic orientation. It also includes route network and  free route airspace (FRA) utilisation rules and  availability.  

The RAD is also an Air Traffic Flow and Capacity  geographical areas or airports. Suspensions may be  implemented for severe weather reroutes, special  events, or as traffic/equipment conditions warrant.  

# Pre-defined routes  

Pre-planned rerouting options are contained in the  National Playbook. It is a collection of Severe Weather  Avoidance Plan (SWAP) routes that have been pre- validated and coordinated with impacted ARTCCs.  They have been designed to mitigate the potential  adverse impact to the FAA and users during periods of  severe  weather  or  other  events  that  affect  coordination of routes. These events include, but are  not  limited  to,  convective  weather,  military  operations, communications, and other situations.  

Other examples of predefined routes include:  

   Coded Departure Routes (CDR). These are a  combination of coded air traffic routings and  refined coordination procedures.     Preferred routes: routes that have been  published by ATC to inform users of the  “normal” traffic flows between airports. They  were developed to increase system efficiency  and capacity by having balanced traffic flows  among high-density airports, as well as de- conflicting traffic flows where possible.  

# Altitude segregation  

Altitude segregation measures are predefined in US  facilities through capping and tunnelling plans:  

   Capping: indicates that aircraft will be cleared  to an altitude lower than their requested  altitude until they are clear of a particular  airspace. Capping may apply to the initial  segment of the flight or for the entire flight.     Tunnelling: descending traffic prior to the  normal descent point at an arrival airport to  keep aircraft clear of an airspace situation on  the route of flight. It is used to avoid conflicting  flows of traffic and holding patterns.  

# Severe Weather Avoidance Plan (SWAP)  

A SWAP is a formalized program that is developed for  areas susceptible to disruption in air traffic flows  caused by thunderstorms.  

This is mainly used for the Northeast, to balance  throughput of arrivals and departures at the New York  City-area airports for those days that convective  weather is forecast.  

There a three-tier system is used, based upon the  severity of the weather as well as the location of the  convective activity:  

Management (ATFCM) tool that is designed as a sole- source flight-planning document, which integrates  both  structural  and  ATFCM  requirements,  geographically and vertically.  

The content of the RAD is agreed between the  Network Manager and the Operational Stakeholders  through an appropriate cooperative decision making  (CDM) process.  

Each State ensures that the RAD is compatible with  their AIP with regard to the airspace organisation  inside the relevant FIR/UIR.  

EUROCONTROL is responsible for preparing of a  common  RAD  reference  document,  collating,  coordinating, validating and publishing it, following  the CDM process as described above.  

# Scenarios  

Scenarios are the European means by which the best  possible airspace organisation combined with the best  ATFCM measures can be implemented to meet  airspace demand and to take into account traffic  flows, airport and ATC capabilities.  

A scenario is a coherent set of measures combining  airspace organisation, route flow restrictions, sector  configuration plan, capacity plan, rerouting plan  and/or regulation plan. Each scenario is accompanied  by its particular modus operandi for use of the  network in relation with the ATC sector configuration,  the route and airspace availability, special events, etc.  

Scenarios are characterised by:  

   the traffic origin   the traffic destination    the scenario type(s)   the On-load Areas  the Off-load Areas    suggested alternative routes  

There are four types of scenario:  

   Level capping scenarios (FL): carried out by  means of level restrictions or through dynamic  routeing restrictions (RAD restrictions, EURO  restrictions).     Rerouteing scenarios (RR): diversion of flows to  off-load traffic from certain areas.     Alternative routeing scenarios (AR): alternative  routes which are exceptionally made available  to  off-load  traffic  from  certain  areas,  implemented by regulations with a low rate.     EU Restrictions: airspace restrictions that  affect the flight planning phase based on route  or airspace closures.  

   SWAP Level 1: Weather is expected to be 100  

miles or more from N90 (NY TRACON) airspace  and/or there is minor impact expected to ZNY  (NY Center) arrival/departure gates, and to  over flight routes. This level of SWAP provides  for developing some basic structure, route  expectations, and planning capability. The  objective is to manage expectations and  complexity early. Customers should begin filing  appropriate route solutions and managing  their flights in response to the actions taken or  planned.  

    SWAP Level 2: Weather is expected to be  between 50-100 miles from N90 airspace  and/or there is moderate impact expected to  ZNY arrival/departure gates, and possibly to  over flight routes. This level of SWAP provides  for increasing structure and reducing holding,  diversions, and other serious complexity  issues. The objective is to prioritize airspace  availability, reduce airborne inventory, and  manage  surface  congestion  issues.  All  initiatives in SWAP Level 1 are included.  

    SWAP Level 3: Weather is expected to be  within 50 miles from N90 airspace and/or  there is moderate or greater impact expected  to ZNY arrival/departure gates, and possibly to  over flight routes. This level of SWAP provides  real-time  constraint,  route  and  volume  management. The focus of this stage is to  prioritize traffic that requires more expeditious  handling, and that requires a much higher  priority than other traffic sharing the same  airspace. The objective is to reduce diversions,  holding,  surface  delays  and  taxi-back  situations. All initiatives in SWAP Level 1 and 2  are included.  

# Event management  

Event management is used to resolve potential  capacity/demand imbalances caused by seasonal or  significant events, by applying ATFCM solutions. These  solutions are a set of ATFCM measures, including  routeing scenarios, to deliver optimum network  performance; they take the constraints of both AOs  and ANSPs into consideration. ATFCM events are:  

   Seasonal events happen every year at the  same time and impact on the ATFCM network  in a relatively predictable way. Examples of  seasonal events include: the South-West Axis  flows, the North-East Axis flows, the ski season  traffic flows etc.     Significant events are those that generate a  strong traffic demand in a relatively small area,  generating local congestion. Examples of  significant events are: the Olympic Games, the  Football World Cup Finals, or Summits of  Heads of States.     Military events refer primarily to military  exercises. They are coordinated with the  national AMC (Airspace Management Cells)  and addressed through specific scenarios.  

The general process consists of preparing scenarios  under the Network Manager Operations Centre's  (NMOC) supervision, in coordination with FMPs from  the ACCs concerned, and the operations staff from the  airlines involved.  

# Axis management  

The above mentioned seasonal events are dealt with  through the axis management process.  

This is a CDM process which starts in advance and has  as an output ATFCM Measures (e.g., re-routings, FL  capping or alternative routings) that would be further  consolidated and applied on the day of operations.  

This output is discussed and agreed through dedicated  CDM conferences (either via a meeting or an e- conference) and there is a monitoring process to fine- tune the event management as well.  

# P RE -T ACTICAL  ATFM  

The ATFM pre-tactical phase encompasses measures taken one day prior to operations.  

During this phase, the traffic demand for the day is analysed and compared to the predicted  available capacity. The plan, developed during the strategic phase, is adapted and adjusted  accordingly.  

The main objective of the pre-tactical phase is to optimize capacity through an effective  organization of resources (e.g. sector configuration management, use of alternate flight  procedures).  

The work methodology is based on a CDM process established between the stakeholders (e.g.  FMU, airspace managers, AUs).  

The tasks to be performed during this phase may include the following:  

   determine the capacity available in the various areas, based on the particular situation  that day;     determine or estimate the demand;     study the airspace or the flows expected to be affected and the airports expected to be  saturated, calculating the acceptance rates to be applied according to system capacity;     conduct a comparative demand/capacity analysis;     prepare a summary of ATFM measures to be proposed and submit them to the ATFM  community for collaborative analysis and discussion; and,     at an agreed-upon number of hours before operations, conduct a last review consultation  involving the affected ATS units and the relevant stakeholders, in order to fine-tune and  determine which ATFM measures should be published through the corresponding ATFM  messaging system.  

The final result of this phase is the ATFM Daily Plan (ADP), which describes the necessary  capacity resources and, if needed, the measures to manage the traffic. This activity is based on  hypotheses developed in the strategic phase and refined to the expected situation. It should be  noted that the time limits of the pre-tactical phase may vary, as they depend on forecast  precision, the nature of operations within the airspace and the capabilities of the various  stakeholders.  

The ADP is developed collaboratively and aims at optimizing the efficiency of the ATM system  and balancing demand and capacity. The objective is to develop strategic and tactical outlooks  for a given airspace volume or airport that can be used by stakeholders as a planning forecast.  

The ADP covers, as a minimum, a 24-hour period. The plan may however cover a shorter period,  provided mechanisms are in place to update the plan regularly.  

The operational intentions of AUs should be consistent with the ADP (developed during the  strategic phase and adjusted during the pre-tactical phase).  

Once the process has been completed, the agreed measures, including the ATFM measures, are  disseminated using an ATFM message, which may be distributed using the various aeronautical  communications networks or any other suitable means of communication, such as internet and  email.

# Operations Plan (OP)  

The FAA ATCSCC Operations Plan represents a view of  the NAS performance, constraints, and risks that are  accurate at the time it is published.  

The time-frame of the Operations Plan is  pre- tactical/tactical .  The Operations Plan is developed  through a collaborative process and the ATCSCC host a  Planning Webinar (PW) with FAA facilities (ARTCCs,  Large TRACONs, and large ATCTs), with flight  operators, and other stakeholders as needed.  Unless  otherwise announced, the first Operations Plan is  published by FAA ATCSCC Advisory no later than 6:00  a.m. Eastern Time.  Unless otherwise announced, the  first PW is conducted at 7:15 am Eastern Time and  every 2 hours thereafter until 9:15 pm Eastern Time.    The ATCSCC has a designated Planner position that is  staffed by a supervisor - National Traffic Management  Officer (NTMO) at the ATCSCC.  The Planner is  responsible for developing, collaborating, conducting  the PW and for publishing the Operations Plan by  Advisory immediately following the PW. An operations  agenda web-page is available to all stakeholders for  submitting proposed constraints and mitigations  between the PWs.  The Planner is responsible for  managing that web-page.  

The Operations Plan has the following sections:  

   Terminal (airport) constraints 

  En-route constraints 

   Plain language description of the Operations Plan 

    Actual  and  anticipated  traffic  management  initiatives (TMIs), such as Ground Delay Programs  (GDPs), Airspace Flow Programs (AFPs), Ground  Stops (GS) 

    Actual and Planned Routes (sometimes referred to  as reroutes) are published.  Actual TMIs and routes  include a valid time while anticipated TMIs and  routes include both a projected valid time and a  qualifying description of the confidence that it may  be needed.  The qualifiers are:  o   Possible – indicates that an initiative may be  needed if the constraint develops as forecast;  timing is broad and confidence is low;   o   Probable – indicates that a TMI is very likely and  confidence is high; timing is less certain; and,   o   Expected – indicates there is high confidence the  TMI will be implemented when the projected  time is reached.   

  Valid time 

   Three PWs contain specialized information:  

# Europe  

# ATFCM Daily Plan (ADP)  

The ADP is a proposed set of tactical ATFCM measures  (TMIs) prepared pre-tactically and agreed between all  partners concerned to optimise the European  Network. It covers a 24-hour period (the day prior to  the day of operation) for each day.  

Normally the ADP starts as a draft on D-2 and it is  finalised and promulgated on D-1 by means of the  ATFCM Notification Message (ANM) and the ATFCM  Information Message (AIM) Network News. During  tactical operations the ADP is further modified  according to the developments of the day.  

# Airspace Use Plan (AUP)  

Agencies responsible for airspace activities submit  their requests for the allocation of airspace or routes –  Temporary Segregated Areas (TSAs) or Conditional  Routes (CDRs) – to the appropriate national AMC  (Airspace Management Cell).  

After  the  AMC  has  received,  evaluated  and  de-conflicted the airspace requests, the notification of  the airspace allocation is published in advance in a  daily AUP.  

   The Airspace Use Plan activates Conditional  Routes and allocates Temporary Segregated  Areas and Cross-Border Areas for specific  periods of time.     If necessary, changes to the pre-tactical  airspace allocation can be made by AMCs  through the publication of an Updated  Airspace Use Plan. This UUP notifies the  changes to the airspace allocation on the  actual day of operations. The process of  update of airspace use requests is very  dynamic.     The AUP and the UUP are published nationally  and internationally in a harmonised format.  

o   at 9:15 am Eastern Time, an extended discussion  of potential structured routes is conducted;   $\bigcirc$  at   $7{\cdot}15~\mathsf{p m}$   Eastern Time Overnight or “Cargo”  operations are discussed;  o   at 9:15 pm Eastern Time a Next Day Outlook is  discussed.  

During the ATFM tactical phase, measures are adopted on the day of the operation. Traffic flows  and capacities are managed in real time. The ADP is amended taking due account of any event  likely to affect it.  

The tactical phase aims at ensuring that:  

   the measures taken during the strategic and pre-tactical phases actually address the  demand/capacity imbalances;     the measures applied are absolutely necessary and that unnecessary measures be  avoided;     capacity is maximized without jeopardizing safety; and     the measures are applied taking due account of equity and overall system optimization.  

During this phase, any opportunity to mitigate disturbances will be used. The need to adjust the  original ADP may result from staffing problems, significant meteorological phenomena, crises  and special events, unexpected opportunities or limitations related to ground or air  infrastructure, more precise flight plan data, the revision of capacity values, etc.  

The provision of accurate information is of paramount importance in this phase, since the aim is  to mitigate the impact of any event using short-term forecasts. Various solutions will be applied,  depending on whether the aircraft are already airborne or about to depart.  

Proactive planning and tactical management require the use of all information available. It is of  vital importance to continuously assess the impact of ATFM measures and to adjust them, in a  collaborative manner, using the information received from the various stakeholders.  

# Table II-4: Tactical ATFM  

![](images/1a8b56263697dc9857ab8c3668c68dbc291351c2e5e7f1707f8725198d667c1f.jpg)  

implementation of a longer-term solution, such as  a Ground Delay Program.     The affected airport´s acceptance rate has been  reduced to zero.  

A facility may initiate a local GS when the facilities  impacted are wholly contained within the facility's  area of responsibility and conditions are not expected  to last more than 30 minutes. Local GSs must not be  extended without prior approval of the ATCSCC.  

The ATCSCC may implement a national GS upon  receipt of information that an immediate constraint is  needed to manage a condition, after less restrictive  TMIs have been evaluated.  

Not all inbound traffic is affected by a GDP or GS. The  scope (departure scope) indicates which traffic is  included in the TMI. Traffic departing from airports  under the jurisdiction of the listed facilities will be  subjected to the TMI. The scope can be distance based  or tier based, eg the local ARTCC, the First Tier ARTCCs  (neighbours), or the Second Tier ARTCCs (neighbours  of neighbours).  

# Managing airspace constraints  

A Departure Stop is similar to a GS. It assigns a  departure stop for a specific NAS element other than a  destination airport, such as an airway, fix, departure  gate, or sector.  

An Airspace Flow Program (AFP) is a delay TMI with  parameters similar to that of a GDP. The major  difference between the two types of initiatives is that  AFPs control the flow of aircraft into or through a  volume of airspace versus controlling the flow of  aircraft to a particular airport. The volume of airspace  used is often one-dimensional (i.e. a border). All of  these volumes are referred to as Flow Constrained  Areas (FCA).  

Flow Evaluation Areas (FEA) are developed on an ad  hoc basis. Just like FCAs, they are three-dimensional  volumes of airspace, along with flight filters and a time  interval, used to identify flights. They may be drawn  graphically, around weather, or they may be based on  a NAS element. They are used to evaluate demand on  a resource. FEAs and FCAs are different because an  Evaluation Area is just under study while a  Constrained Area requires action to address a  particular situation.  

FEA/FCAs provide reroutes using the Create Reroute  capability and are published through a reroute  advisory with an optional flight list attached.  Stakeholders can monitor FEA/FCAs through reroute  monitor in traffic situation display (TSD), web situation  display (WSD) or collaborative constraint situation  display (CCSD).  

# Managing airspace constraints  

Europe uses ATFM regulations to manage en-route  traffic flows. En-route ATFM regulations can apply:  

   To an airspace volume (AS) or to a special point  (SP). This is called the Reference Location (RL). 

    To all or just to a subset of the traffic crossing the  RL. This is called a traffic volume (TV).  

En-route ATFM regulations can either take the form of  

   A delay TMI. Those are comparable to AFPs. 

    A TMI for rerouting purposes, not generating delay  (normally part of a scenario see above):  o   Level capping (FL): implemented by a zero-rate  regulation with vertical restriction  o   Required rerouting (RR): implemented by a zero- rate regulation  o   Alternative routeing (AR): implemented by a  regulation with a low rate through airspace  normally not accessible to the traffic flow.  

In Europe the Network Manager has – in collaboration  with aircraft operators – put in place a process called  the Flight Efficiency Initiative (FEI). It is based on  voluntary participation by aircraft operators and aims  at offering them the most efficient routes on the day  of operation. It entails scrutinising their flight plans  and seeing if there is not a quicker or more cost- effective way for their aircraft to fly.  

The FEI operates on the basis of a dynamic route  generator and an automatically maintained catalogue  of routes flown in the past. The routes are evaluated  on the basis of subjective cost criteria provided by the  airline operators, such as:  

The Required Reroutes (RR) TMI is often applied in  conjunction with delay programs to move flows  around en-route constraints. The impact of the  reroute is dependent on how it is implemented and  what type of delay program it is interacting with.  Required reroutes are issued by Departure (ETD),  Arrival (ETA) or FCA entry time.  

CTOP (Collaborative Trajectory Options Program) is a  new type of TMI, which automatically assigns delay  and/or reroutes around one or more FCA-based  airspace constraints in order to balance demand with  available capacity. The unique feature of CTOP is that  it allows for user preferences in route selection. Under  a CTOP initiative, operators submit alternative routes  of their choice around or away from a constraint, thus  providing additional options for air traffic controllers  to expedite flights away from congested airspace.  Flights that have submitted a trajectory option set  (TOS) could be exempt from ground delays or in-flight  reroutes associated with such constraints.  

ICR (Integrated Collaborative Rerouting) is a process  that builds on the FCA technology. The ICR process  requires that a constraint be identified early. ICR  allows airspace users to take action with their  trajectory preferences in response to an identified  system constraint. They have an opportunity to  consider the area of concern and provide EI (Early  Intent) messages that communicate their decisions in  response to the constraint. At the expiration of the EI  window, traffic managers can analyze the customer  responses and decide if the actions taken have  resolved the issue or decide if recommended routes,  required routes, airspace flow programs, or other  traffic management initiatives (TMI) will be necessary  to further reduce demand.  

# Slot substitution (subbing)  

The substitution process provides a way for airspace  users, henceforth referred to as users, to manage  their flights during a GDP, GS or AFP. Users can, for  example, swap slots between a high priority flight and  a less important flight, reducing the delay on one at  the cost of increasing the delay for another.  Users  may only sub for their own flights; there is no trading  or bartering for slots.  

 flying time costs, 

   fuel costs and 

    the cost of air traffic flow and capacity  management (ATFCM) delays.  

The FEI is based on a re-routing process that can take  place on the day of operations up to two hours before  the flight. It takes place in two phases:  

   First phase: AOs and computerized flight plan  service providers (CFSPs) can use an NM tool to  compare their flight plans with the best filed flight  plan accepted by the NM for a given city pair 

    Second phase: Re-routing proposals from the NM  to AOs  

The FEI also contributes to a strategic and continuous  improvement of the airlines’ route catalogues.  

# Slot swapping  

In Europe the ETFMS slot swapping functionality is  used to swap flights requested by AOs or FMPs.  Additionally it may be used to improve another flight  if an aircraft operator requests a slot extension (i.e.  instead of forcing the flight).  

AOs shall only request swaps concerning flights for  which they are the responsible operator or where  there is a formal agreement between both AOs to  swap flights. For regulated flights departing from an A- CDM, AOs shall request the swap via the FMP / TWR.  

FMPs may request swaps for two flights of the same  AO or, during critical events at airports, also between  any different AOs.  

In the tactical phase Europe also uses STAM, Short Term ATFCM Measures, such as minor ground  delays, flight level capping and minor re-routings applied to a limited number of flights, both  airborne and pre-departure. STAM application allows reducing the complexity and/or demand of  anticipated/identified traffic peaks and to prevent or limit the penalization that would result  from the implementation of standard ATFCM measures.  

Europe is also moving its first steps in Target Time Operations, by including the Target Time Over  in the ATFM Slot Allocation Messages. At now this is provided to create operational awareness  of the planned time at the congestion point. Further developments are planned to use Target  Time over to optimise ATFM delivery.  

F INE - TUNING OF TRAFFIC FLOWS BY  ATC  

After ATFM measures are taken, traffic flows are further fine-tuned by ATC.  

A distinction can be made between TMIs that have an impact on traffic prior to take-off, and  those acting on airborne traffic.  

# TMIs that have an impact on traffic prior to take-off  

These are sequencing and metering measures that are used by ATC to fine-tune the traffic flow  and that may have a delay impact on traffic prior to take-off.  

The resulting cleared-for-take-off time (Call For Release Time – CFR) may be different from the  slot time (EDCT/CTOT) produced by ATFM. Normally this adjustment falls within the ATFM  tolerance window:  

   In the US this called the EDCT Window:   ${\mathfrak{-5/+5m i n}},$  ;     In Europe it is the STW (Slot Tolerance Window):   $^{-5/+10}$  min during normal conditions and  during adverse conditions up to   $15/{+30}\mathsf{m i n}$  .  

In specific cases sequencing and metering may create additional delay beyond the ATFM  tolerance window.  

In the US the CFR Window (Call For Release Window) for ATOT is  $^{-2/+1}$  min around the assigned  CFR time.  

In Europe, for flights without an ATFM slot there is a DTW (Departure Tolerance Window) for  ATOT of  $^{-15/+15}$  min around the ETOT during normal conditions, during adverse conditions  possibly extended to   $\mathbf{\cdot}15/\mathbf{+}30\mathbf{m}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{n}$  .  

The TMIs in this category include:  

 52CFR (Call for Release)   (US)     DSP (Departure Spacing) (US)     ESP (En-route Spacing)     ASP (Arrival Spacing)     Metering (en-route metering)     MDI (Minimum Departure Interval) (Europe)     MIT (Miles In Trail)     MINIT  (Minutes In Trail)  

# TMIs acting on airborne traffic  

This TMI category comprises longitudinal (sequencing and metering), lateral (load balancing) and  vertical (level off) tactical measures that are used by ATC after take-off with the objective to  fine-tune the traffic flow.  

   TBM (Time Based Metering) not propagating to the departure airport (US)   $\bigcirc$    TBFM Speed Advisories (US) / XMAN (Cross-border Arrival Management) speed  advisories (Europe)     AH (Airborne Holding)  o   Planned Holding  o   Unplanned Holding   Vectoring    Tactical level offs     Point Merge (Europe)   Fix Balancing  

# POST-OPERATIONS ANALYSIS  

The final step in the ATFM planning and management process is the post-operations analysis  phase.  

During this phase, an analytical process is carried out to measure, investigate and report on  operational processes and activities. This process is the cornerstone of the development of best  practices and/or lessons learned that will further improve the operational processes and  activities. It covers all ATFM domains and all the external units relevant to an ATFM service.  

While most of the post-operations analysis process may be carried out within the ATFM unit,  close coordination and collaboration with ATFM stakeholders will yield better and more reliable  results.  

Post-operations analysis is accomplished by evaluating the ADP and its results. Reported issues  and operational statistics are evaluated and analysed in order to learn from experience and to  make appropriate adjustments and improvements in the future.  

Post-operations analysis includes analysis of items such as anticipated and unanticipated events,  ATFM measures and delays, the use of predefined scenarios, flight planning and airspace data  issues. They compare the anticipated outcome (where assessed) with the actual measured  outcome, generally in terms of delay and route extension, while taking into account  performance targets.  

All stakeholders within the ATFM service can provide feedback, preferably in a standardized  electronic format, enabling the information to be used in the post-operations analysis in an  automated manner.  

Post-operations analysis is used to:  

   identify operational trends or opportunities for improvement;     further investigate the cause and effect relationship of ATFM measures to assist in the  selection and development of future actions and strategies;     gather additional information with the goal of optimizing ATM system efficiency in general  or for on-going events;     perform analysis of specific areas of interest, such as irregular operations, special events,  or the use of re-route proposals; and     make recommendations on how to optimize ATM system performance and to minimize  the negative impact of ATFM measures on operations.  

It is important to ensure that the relevant ATFM stakeholders are made aware of the results. The  following processes support this:  

 collection and assessment of data including comparison with targets;  broad review and further information gathering at a daily briefing;  weekly operations management meeting to assess results and recommend procedural, training and system changes where necessary to improve performance; and  periodic operations review meetings with stakeholders.
