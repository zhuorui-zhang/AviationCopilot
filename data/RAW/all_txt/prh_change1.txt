# Parachute Rigger Handbook  

# August 2015  

# Change 1 (December 2015)  

# Preface  

The Parachute Rigger Handbook introduces the basic skills necessary for acquiring a Parachute Rigger Certificate. It is  developed by the Flight Standards Service, Airman Testing Standards Branch, in cooperation with various aviation educators  and industry.  

This handbook is primarily intended to assist individuals who are preparing for the parachute rigger airman knowledge  test and the oral and practical test. The material presented in this handbook is appropriate for senior and master parachute  riggers. The handbook contains information on regulations and human factors, design and construction, materials, operations,  inspection and packing, hand tools, sewing machines, the parachute loft, repairs, alterations, and manufacture.  

This handbook conforms to training and certification concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing specific rigging procedures, and many variations in the  explanations of repairs, alterations, and manufacture of parachutes. The discussion and explanations reflect commonly  used practices and principles. This handbook provides a basic knowledge that can serve as a foundation on which to build  further knowledge. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical.  The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   and  appropriate technical standards. Performance standards for demonstrating competence required for parachute riggers are  prescribed in the appropriate practical test standard.  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from www.faa.gov. The current Flight Standards Service airman  training and testing material and learning statements for all airman certificates and ratings can be obtained from www.faa.gov.  

The FAA greatly acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by many individuals and organizations throughout the  aviation community whose expertise contributed to the preparation of this handbook. This handbook contains material and  pictures of various products often used by industry. It is presented here as a means of communicating information to be  used for training purposes only. The FAA neither endorses nor recommends any specific trademark item in this handbook.

# Introduction to  Parachute Rigging  

# Regulations and Human Factors  

A parachute rigger has a critical responsibility to anyone  who uses a parachute. For many, a special meaning can be  attributed to ensuring the safety of a piece of equipment that  may save their life or that of a friend. For others, attention to  detail may keep a stranger safe during recreational activities,  such as skydiving or aerobatic flying. This chapter explains  what parachute riggers do and what is required to earn a  Parachute Rigger Certificate. In addition, this chapter covers  relevant human factor issues and ethical standards.

The term “rigger” originated in the  $16^{\mathrm{th}}$   Century and referred  to a person who organized, repaired, and maintained sails and  lines aboard sailing ships. The rigger was not a high-ranking  individual aboard the ship, but he was an essential technician  that could not be done without. Likewise, parachute riggers,  as indispensible as they are, must operate within strict  boundaries set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA). When parachutes were developed in the early   $20^{\mathrm{th}}$    Century, those who sewed the canopies and lines became  known as “riggers.” In those first decades, anyone with some  knowledge of sewing and materials could make or repair  parachutes. As the aviation industry grew and matured,  the need for trained individuals to pack and maintain the  parachutes grew as well. In order to protect the pilots and  public who flew in airplanes and relied on parachutes, the  government began to license these individuals. Rigging, in  reference to parachutes, came to mean: the final adjustment  and alignment of the various component sections to provide  the proper aerodynamic reaction.  

# Parachute Rigger Certificates  

Parachutes intended for emergency use in civil aircraft in  the United States, including the reserve parachute of a dual  parachute system to be used for intentional jumping, must  be packed, maintained, or altered by a person who holds an  appropriate and current Parachute Rigger Certificate. The  certificate is issued under Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR), part 65, subpart F. These regulations  do not apply to an individual who packs the main parachute  of a dual parachute pack to be used for intentional jumping.  These regulations also do not apply to parachutes packed,  maintained, or altered for use by the Armed Forces.  

Any person who holds a Parachute Rigger Certificate must  present it for inspection if requested by the Administrator or  an authorized representative of the National Transportation  Safety Board (NTSB) or any federal, state, or local law  enforcement officer. A sample certificate is shown in  Figure 1-1 .  

# Eligibility and Requirements  

To be eligible for a Parachute Rigger Certificate issued by the  FAA, individuals must be at least 18 years of age; be able to  read, write, speak, and understand the English language; and  comply with other requirements of 14 CFR, part 65, subpart  F, which governs the certification of parachute riggers.  

There are two levels of Parachute Rigger Certificate available  in the United States: senior and master. The Senior Parachute  Rigger candidate must pack a minimum of 20 parachutes of  one type and be able to demonstrate the ability to maintain  and make minor repairs. The Master Parachute Rigger  candidate must have 3 years of experience as a parachute  

![](images/5cf4855ef2c9fbeae445b167f70c5aaaf141803ec33549ec2f3820f5ec7772a8.jpg)  
Figure 1-1.   Airman's Certificate—Master Parachute Rigger.  

rigger and have packed at least 100 parachutes of two types  in common use (for a total of 200 pack jobs). There are  four type ratings that may be placed on a Parachute Rigger  Certificate: back, chest, seat, and lap. Of these, the first three  are used today. The lap rating applies to parachutes that are  basically obsolete. A Senior Parachute Rigger is considered  a journeyman technician, and the Master Parachute Rigger  is considered an expert.  

The two types of certificates differ in the level of experience  and responsibility. A Senior Parachute Rigger may pack, as  well as maintain, a parachute by making minor repairs. A  Master Parachute Rigger has all the privileges of the lesser  certificate plus the ability to make major repairs and alter  parachutes according to approved data. A major repair is  one that, if improperly done, can appreciably affect the  airworthiness of the parachute. An example of a major repair  might be replacing a damaged canopy panel or altering a  harness by changing the size of a main lift web. A minor  repair is anything other than a major repair, such as a small  patch on a canopy or the replacement of a defective or worn  connector link.  

# Earning a Parachute Rigger Certificate  

When an applicant meets the requirements and demonstrates  sufficient knowledge and skills as outlined in 14 CFR part 65,  subpart F, the supervising parachute rigger (either a senior or  Master Parachute Rigger) “signs off” on the trainee’s logbook  and provides a letter to the FAA that allows the applicant to  take the necessary tests.  [Figure 1-2]  

![](images/81061cc7e73c2e759d99a578ffcd4d5f027e17e5e3bbc35c3fd50a6827fb6d76.jpg)  
Figure 1-2.   Certification letter signing off a parachute rigger  candidate for FAA testing.  

Once the rigging candidate has successfully achieved a  rigger's certificate, they can now begin to learn through  experience. Rigging is best learned through apprenticeship;  however, it takes a lot of time to become intimately familiar  with materials, learn how to identify stains, and experience  packing the myriad of sport parachute systems.  

# Testing  

The applicant should take a letter similar to the one depicted  in  Figure 1-2 , the applicant’s logbook, and any other  necessary identification to the nearest FAA Flight Standards  District Office (FSDO) or International Field Office (IFO).  An FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) (airworthiness)  examines these documents for completeness and eligibility.  The applicant is asked to fill out FAA Form 8610-2, Airman  Certificate and/or Rating Application. When the inspector has  determined that the applicant is eligible to take the test, he  or she signs the FAA Form 8610-2.  [Figure 1-3]  Once this  is done, the applicant may then go to any of the designated  FAA airman knowledge testing centers to take the airman  knowledge written test.  

The knowledge test consists of 50 multiple-choice questions  that are not designed to be tricky or misleading. They cover  all basic rigging and packing subject areas in addition to 14  CFR part 65 regulations. A minimum score of 70 percent is  required to pass the test. The test is scored immediately on  conclusion of the test and a Certified Airman Knowledge  Test report is issued to the applicant.  [Figure 1-4]  After  passing the test, the candidate may then make an appointment  for taking the oral and practical portion of the test with a  Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner (DPRE).  

Under 14 CFR, part 183, DPREs are Master Parachute  Riggers who have attended an FAA course and are authorized  to conduct oral and practical tests for the Administrator. In  many cases, these individuals are full-time professionals  who work in the parachute industry. Upon the successful  completion of the oral and practical tests, in most cases, the  DPRE issues a Temporary Parachute Rigger Certificate and  a seal symbol to the candidate.  [Figure 1-5]  In some FSDO  jurisdictions, the district office may issue the temporary  certificate and/or seal symbol. The seal symbol consists  of three letters or numbers or a combination of both.  [Figure 1-6]  The seal symbol is very important; it serves as  the identifying mark for that individual parachute rigger and  is used to seal any parachute that he or she packs.  

# Alternate Means of Qualifying for a Parachute Rigger  Certificate  

Active duty military personnel and civilian personnel who  work for the military as parachute riggers may qualify for a  Senior Parachute Rigger Certificate under the provisions of  14 CFR part 65, section 65.117, Special Certification Rule.  If they meet the practical requirements, they need only take  a special 25-question test.  

A Senior Parachute Rigger applying for a Master Parachute  Rigger Certificate only needs to take the oral and practical  test. A person with 3 years experience as a parachute rigger,  but not holding a Senior Parachute Rigger Certificate, must  take both the knowledge test and the oral and practical test.  Any parachute rigger, senior or master, who wishes to add  additional ratings to his or her certificate needs to take only  a practical test for the type rating sought. No additional  knowledge test is necessary.  

# Retesting  

If the applicant fails the knowledge test, he or she may retake  the test under the following conditions: An applicant may  apply for retesting by presenting the failed test report:  

• 	 30 days after the date the applicant failed the test; or • 	 before 30 days have expired if the applicant presents a  signed statement from an airman holding the certificate  and rating sought by the applicant certifying that the  airman has given the applicant additional instruction  in each of the subjects failed and that the airman  considers the applicant ready for retesting.

It is also possible for candidates who pass the test but receive  a marginal score to retake the test with the anticipation of  getting a higher score. In this case, the candidate must wait  a minimum of 30 days from the date the last test was taken  to retake a passed test. Prior to retesting, the individual must  give his or her current airman test report to the proctor. The  most recent test taken reflects the official score.  

# Responsibilities of a Certificated Parachute  Rigger  

Parachute riggers have a broad range of responsibilities  that include ensuring that proper facilities and equipment  are available to him or her, adhering to certain performance  standards, record keeping, and use of their seal. The following  describes the responsibilities of a certificated parachute rigger.  

# Facilities and Tools  

Issuance of a Parachute Rigger Certificate is just the first  step toward becoming a professional parachute rigger. As  the un-certificated apprentice gains experience packing, he  or she should also begin to acquire an inventory of tools and  manuals necessary to exercise the privileges of a certificate.  In compliance with 14 CFR part 65, section 65.127, there are  several items required. One of these requirements is a smooth  tabletop that is at least 3 feet wide by 40 feet long. Note that  there is no specification for height. A table is only desirable  if the parachute rigger is going to pack round parachutes.  With the predominance of square reserve parachutes in the  skydiving community, some parachute riggers specialize in  packing only square reserves. A table can be used for packing  this type of parachute, but the manufacturer may specify  any smooth, clean surface of a size that accommodates the  canopy. In this case, a clean, carpeted floor does the job and  a table may not be necessary. According to 14 CFR part 65,  subsection 65.127(b), the parachute rigger needs suitable  housing that is adequately heated, lighted, and ventilated for  drying and airing parachutes. This is subject to interpretation  by the parachute rigger and the Administrator since the  standards fluctuate based on location and time of year.  

A parachute rigger must have enough tools and equipment  to pack and maintain the types of parachutes for which he or  she is rated to service. This may include only the basic tools  of a packing fid, temporary pin, and pull-up cord if this is all  that the manufacturer says is necessary to pack its product.  However, there is a broad selection of tools necessary for a  well-equipped parachute rigger to possess. These are covered  in detail in Chapter 6, Hand Tools, Sewing Machines, and  the Parachute Loft.  

# Performance Standards  

A number of performance standards are defined in 14 CFR  part 65, section 65.129 to guide the parachute rigger’s  performance of the duties that fall under the certificate. The  parachute rigger may not:  

• 	 Pack, maintain, or alter any parachute unless he or she  is rated for that type. •	 Pack a parachute that is not safe for emergency use. • 	 Pack a parachute that is not thoroughly dried and aired. • 	 Alter a parachute in a manner not specifically  authorized by the Administrator or the manufacturer  of the parachute.  

The last item in this list is one that has been abused by  many Master Parachute Riggers over the years. The Master  Parachute Rigger must have Administrator or manufacturer  approval, in writing, to be in compliance with this regulation.  

Aside from the necessary tools, 14 CFR part 65, subsection  65.129(f) states that parachute riggers may exercise the  privileges of the certificate only if they understand the current  manufacturer’s instructions for the operation involved. This  means that the rigger must possess a copy of the instructions  or have access to them during the operation. If they do not  have a copy, but the owner of the parachute provides them,  then the parachute rigger may pack or maintain the parachute.  

![](images/080c91a5bb2283e68d2e6ca2885d7a5f6bcde3ba68aa3671d650317caef39aba.jpg)  

![](images/795fc1590663039c39e9c97158953811d55cb414e00483e6afdf2c3e29097f19.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.   Parachute Rigger’s Seal.  

A variation on this theme is accessing the packing instruction  via the Internet. Many manufacturers provide manuals via  their websites. If the parachute rigger does not download  the actual instruction, they must show that they had access  during the packing of the parachute. For example, a laptop  computer may not have a printer attached but could still meet  this requirement.  

Parachute riggers are not necessarily required to download  the instructions to a hard drive or disk as long as they are able  to access the manual in real time. However, if a problem is  identified with the parachute rigger’s pack job at a later date,  the parachute rigger would need to prove to the Administrator  that he or she had access to the instructions. Without a  hardcopy or downloaded computer files, it would appear  that the parachute rigger had not met the rule requirement.  

# Currency Requirements  

Once an individual obtains a Parachute Rigger Certificate, it  is valid for life unless surrendered, suspended, or revoked.  If the individual intends to work as a parachute rigger and  not just have the certificate, it is necessary that he or she  maintain currency as a practicing parachute rigger. These  currency requirements include at least one of the following.  

• 	 Performing parachute rigger duties for at least 90 days  within the preceding 12 months.  

• 	 Demonstrating to the Administrator the ability to  perform those duties.  

# Record Keeping  

Maintaining proper records of parachute rigger activities is an  important responsibility. This is necessary for the protection  of the parachute rigger, the user of the parachute, and the  satisfaction of the Administrator. Under 14 CFR part 65,  section 65.131, certificated parachute riggers must document  the packing, maintenance, and alteration of parachutes they  have performed or supervised. These records normally are  documented in a parachute rigger’s logbook. The following  information must be documented:  

• 	 Parachute type and make • 	 Serial number • 	 Name and address of the owner • 	 Description of the work performed • 	 Date and location of work performed • 	 Results of any drop tests  

These records must be kept for a minimum of 2 years.  Figure 1-7  shows a sample of a logbook page. In addition,  each parachute rigger must note on the parachute packing  record or data card the following information:  [Figure 1-8]  

• 	 Date and location of packing • 	 A notation of any defects found on inspection • 	 Parachute Rigger Certificate number • 	 Parachute rigger name and signature  

While not required on the data card, it has become  commonplace for the parachute rigger to note the work  performed as well. This is usually noted as assemble and pack  (A&P) or inspect and repack (I&R). Professional parachute  riggers often use an ink stamp on the data card that indicates  name, certificate number, seal symbol, and provides an area  for signature. This allows the customer or other parachute  riggers to read the name (some signatures are illegible) and  to correlate the last entry with the seal on the parachute.  

![Figure 1-7.   Parachute Rigger Logbook Page. ](images/950af32bfdc66361d97fa12888498f36965d18861a5eb5c6c52d3d42bf136ce3.jpg)

# Sealing the Parachute  

As noted previously, each certificated parachute rigger is  issued a unique symbol with which to seal each parachute  once he or she packs it in a manner prescribed by the  manufacturer. A hand press, 4.75 pound tensile seal thread,  and a lead blank are used for this purpose. This ensures that  no one tampers with the parachute, and the owner knows  that it is ready for use.  

# Regulatory Compliance  

As with other airman certificates, there are additional parts of  14 CFR that are of direct concern to the parachute rigger in  addition to those already mentioned. It is important that the  parachute rigger have a thorough understanding of these parts  in order to avoid any inadvertent non-compliance: 14 CFR  parts 1, 21, 39, 91, 105, and 183.  

# 14 CFR part 1—Definitions  

This part provides legal definitions for words and abbreviations  under this title. One of the more important terms in this  part is that of the Administrator. The Administrator is the  administrative head of the FAA or any employee of the FAA  to whom authority has been delegated. The parachute rigger  is most likely to come in contact with two individuals who  may act on the Administrator’s behalf.  

The first is the ASI from the local FSDO or IFO. This  employee of the FAA is responsible for enforcement of the  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in aviation matters. The  ASI (airworthiness type) has jurisdictional responsibility in  such matters as compliance with the rules, approving data  for major repairs or alterations, investigation of accidents,  overseeing airshows and demo jumps, or any aviation- related matter.  

The second is the local DPRE. This private person is  empowered to conduct practical tests for the Administrator.  

# 14 CFR part 21, subpart O—Technical Standard  Orders (TSO)  

A Technical Standard Order (TSO) is issued by the  Administrator and is a minimum performance standard for  specified articles, such as parachutes. It is important that  the parachute rigger understand the TSO process and the  various levels of TSO approval under which parachutes  are manufactured. Every parachute rigger should read and  become familiar with the TSOs for parachutes, the 23 series  (C23b, C23c, C23d). This is important to the parachute rigger  in determining certification compatibility when he or she is  assembling approved components.  

# 14 CFR part 39—Airworthiness Directives (ADs)  

This part specifically deals with Airworthiness Directives  (ADs). An AD is an amendment to the CFR. An AD must  be complied with before using an affected product. In the  case of a parachute, when:  

• 	 An unsafe condition exists in a product. • 	 The condition is likely to exist or develop in other  products of the same type or design.  

Under 14 CFR part 39, “No person may operate a product to  which an airworthiness directive applies except in accordance  with the requirements of that airworthiness directive.”  

In recent years, there have been a number of parachute ADs  issued by the Administrator. These ADs prescribe certain  actions to be taken by the parachute rigger in order to ensure  the safety and function of parachutes that have been found  in some manner to be defective. If the parachute rigger does  not comply with the AD, the parachute rigger cannot pack,  maintain, or alter the affected parachute. ADs are mailed  to each certificated parachute rigger on the FAA listing. If  the parachute rigger has moved and not complied with the  requirements for an address change, the rigger may not receive  the AD. This introduces an additional problem. Under 14  CFR, part 65, subpart A—General, section 65.21, airmen must  register their change of address within 30 days of moving or  they are not able to exercise the privileges of their certificate.  

# 14 CFR part 91—General Operating and Flight Rules  

14 CFR part 91, section 91.307 of 14 CFR deals with  parachutes and parachuting. This section defines an “approved  parachute” and states the repack time for parachutes. Both of  these are of vital interest to the parachute rigger.  

# 14 CFR part 105, subpart C—Parachute Equipment  and Packing  

14 CFR part 105 deals with the use of parachutes in the United  States. The following areas are of interest to parachute riggers:  

• 	 Main parachutes used for intentional jumping must be  packed by the person jumping or by a U.S. certificated  parachute rigger. • 	 The auxiliary parachute must be packed by a  certificated and appropriately-rated parachute rigger. • 	 If the parachute is made from synthetic materials, it  must be packed within 180 days of its use. If it is made  from materials subject to mold or mildew (natural  fibers), then it must be packed within 60 days of use. • 	 If a main static line is used, it must meet certain  requirements as to its use and configuration. • 	 An approved parachute is defined as a parachute  manufactured under a type certificate or a TSO (C-23  series), or a personnel-carrying U.S. military parachute  (other than a high altitude, high speed, or ejection  type), identified by a Navy Air Facility, an Army Air  Field, an Air Force-Navy drawing number, an Army  Air Field order number, or any military designation  or specification number.  

# Rigging Ethics  

As parachute riggers gain additional experience, they are  occasionally faced with situations that involve less than ideal  circumstances. For example, they may be presented with a new  jumper who has purchased old or damaged equipment that may  or may not be airworthy; or it may be a pilot who purchased an  acrobatic plane that came with a parachute that is far too small  for his or her weight. These situations involve more than just  the technical knowledge for a Parachute Rigger Certificate.  

In the case of the pilot above, depending on which TSO  the parachute is certified, there may be a weight and  speed limitation for the system. For example, TSO C23c  category B has a limitation of 254-pound exit weight and a  speed limitation of 150 knots. Imagine a pilot who weighs  225 pounds and his airplane regularly exceeds the 150- knot envelope during maneuvering. If this pilot brings a  parachute to a parachute rigger for repacking, the first thing  the parachute rigger should notice is the size of the pilot.  When the parachute rigger inspects the parachute, he notices  that it has a 22-foot diameter round canopy. The parachute  rigger finds that with the pilot at 225 pounds, his clothes at 5  pounds, and the parachute at 20 pounds, he is at 250 pounds  or just under the limit. However, in looking at the owner’s  manual, the parachute rigger cannot find any information  in the weight-carrying limit of the canopy. In addition, this  particular parachute was made by a company that is no longer  in business. The parachute appears to be in good condition  visually but is 30 years old. In this situation, the parachute  rigger is faced with a number of questionable areas that are  detailed below.  

# Certification Specifications  

The practical matter of the above pilot’s use of the parachute  is that he is at the maximum limits of the certification  specifications of that parachute. If he does not eat a big  breakfast or gain much weight before using the parachute,  he might stay under the weight limit. The speed limitation  is probably exceeded on a regular basis during acrobatic  maneuvers. If he needs to use the parachute at some point,  there should be enough of a safety margin built into the design  and testing of the parachute to be sufficient.  

# Pilot Versus Parachute Size  

With 250 pounds under a 22-foot diameter canopy, the pilot  probably drops from the sky at an excessive rate of descent.  A common assumption in this situation is that it is unlikely he  needs to use the parachute, but if he does, will it save his life?  

# Parachute Service Life  

There is no service life on the parachute; it may be considered  airworthy as long as it meets its TSO. While the parachute  appears to be in good condition, there are not many non- destructive tests available to the parachute rigger in the field  to make this determination. It may be possible to drop test  the parachute, but the cost would probably outweigh the  value of the system. It is up to the parachute rigger to make  the determination as to the airworthiness of the parachute  system. When the parachute rigger seals the parachute and  signs the data card, the rigger is saying it is ready, thereby  putting the customer’s life on the line.  

What should the parachute rigger do? This is not just a  theoretical situation—it is one that has been experienced  many times by many parachute riggers. All of the above  information plus economic factors complicate the parachute  rigger’s decision. If the rigger does not pack the parachute,  the pilot may take it down the road to another parachute  rigger for a second opinion who may not have the same  standards. An added factor is liability exposure. If the  parachute rigger signs off on a questionable parachute  and an accident occurs later, the rigger may be exposed to  disciplinary action from the Administrator in addition to  civil action in the courts. There are no hard and fast rules  in these situations, but instead the parachute rigger must  exercise the best judgment he or she can summon based on  experience and the information at hand.  

The most important thought to keep in mind with regard  to parachute rigging is that the purpose of the 180-day  inspection and repack cycle is to inspect the parachute and  all of its sub-assemblies, as well as the harness/container  system and all of its sub-assemblies. Almost any parachute  could theoretically remain packed for years and still open  and function normally if stored in a perfect environment,  as long as all the materials were chemically stable. History  has shown however, that in rare instances fabrics can break  down spontaneously and their chemical makeup can change,  possibly compromising the integrity of the entire system.  Therefore it is imperative that a thorough inspection is done  on a frequent and regular basis by a competent rigger prior  to repack. The conscientious rigger is the ultimate safety net  between the jumper and the ground.  

Most professional parachute riggers would refuse to pack the  parachute described in the scenario above due to the age of  the parachute, the size of the individual, and the potential use  parameters. The conscientious rigger should give the pilot all  of the facts concerning permissible exit weights and speeds  and probable system performance, or lack thereof. Perhaps  the pilot can be convinced to purchase a more appropriate  emergency parachute, one that is certified for higher weight  and speeds.  

# Chapter Summary  

This first chapter summarized the need-to-know areas of  14 CFR and familiarized the rigger candidate with the 8610-2  Rating Application and other pertinent documents. Become  familiar with 14 CFR online at http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi- bin/text-idx?SID  $\leftleftarrows$  ea18c91ab7072a02b2cefba39393ebfc&t pl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14tab_02.tpl. There is an overview  of the rigger’s responsibilities, limitations, and currency  requirements. Becoming a well-rounded parachute rigger  is a serious undertaking and requires independent study and  determination to learn the history of parachutes, as well as  current methods and materials.  

# Design and Construction  

# Introduction  

It is important for the aspiring rigger to understand basic  design parameters and construction techniques of modern  parachute systems. The master rigger must have a thorough  understanding of these areas to perform any desired or  necessary alterations. An understanding of how the systems  or components were originally designed, and why they were  constructed as they were, is essential. Any proposed alteration  may degrade the function and/or structural integrity of the  assembly or component thereby causing it to fail.  

![](images/713ef864bf93cbe69f5e627a8e1ddab0da763406d376feedde69a0a320e42aaf.jpg)  

# Parachute Design and Construction  

The design parameters for certificated parachutes are set  forth in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents,  specifically within the Technical Standard Order (TSO)  system. Parachute certification standards fall within the  TSO C23 series. Currently, there are three TSO documents  under which parachutes are manufactured: C23b, C23c,  and C23d. Appendix A of this handbook explains these  standards in detail. Military parachutes are manufactured  and certified under a military drawing system; however,  some manufacturers have certified them under the TSO  system as well.  

Advisory Circular (AC) 105-2D, Sport Parachuting explains  that a parachute assembly normally, but not exclusively,  consists of the following major components: a canopy, a  deployment device, a pilot chute and/or drogue, risers, a  stowage container, a harness, and an actuation device (ripcord).  

# Component Parts  

Parachute assemblies and component parts are identified in  the following discussion. The appropriate nomenclatures, as  well as the commonly accepted names, are defined below.  

# Main Parachute Canopy  

The main parachute canopy is used in conjunction with a  reserve parachute assembly as the primary parachute canopy  for a premeditated jump. The main canopy consists of  everything from the main riser connector links to the bridle  attachment point (excluding the steering toggles). The major  parts are the suspension lines and the canopy.  [Figure 2-1]  

# Reserve Parachute Canopy  

The reserve parachute canopy is worn in conjunction with  a main parachute used for premeditated jumps. The reserve  parachute consists of everything from the reserve riser  connector links to the bridle attachment point (excluding the  steering toggles). The major parts are the canopy, suspension  lines, and any type of deployment device that is sewn to the  canopy or lines.  

# Emergency Parachute Canopy  

The emergency parachute canopy is worn for emergency,  unpremeditated use only. The canopy may be identical to  the reserve parachute canopy.  

# Harness/Container  

The harness and container assembly includes all the  remaining parts necessary to complete an airworthy  parachute system except for the canopies. The basic harness/  

![](images/debd274ed83abdeb938c08876f044dc91170caf2e2c53187878abebed5c256d7.jpg)  
Figure 2-1.  Component parts of a ram-air parachute.  

container assembly is what remains when all items that can  be removed without unstitching have been removed. Most  sport parachute assemblies have the harness and containers  integrated into one assembly, but many military assemblies  may be disassembled into separate harness and container  subassemblies. The following items are subcomponents of  the harness/container assembly and are shown in  Figure 2-2 .  

# Pilot Chutes and Bridles for the Main and Reserve  Parachutes  

The pilot chute is a small parachute or similar device that  enters the airstream when released to act as a drag device and  withdraw the canopy from the container. As such, it maintains  tension on the canopy and lines during the deployment  process, except for reserve “Free Bags.” Pilot chutes are  either spring-loaded or manually thrown into the airstream as  a “hand deployed” pilot chute. Some military or emergency  pilot chutes are ballistically deployed. A bridle is a piece  of line or webbing that connects the canopy or deployment  device to the pilot chute.  

![](images/4d9f17891609890433a9dea0b27b9815bcf5d2e5fa46a9e5ddded891416f7d5d.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.  Subcomponents of the harness/container assembly.  

# Ripcords or Equivalent Devices for the Main and  Reserve Parachutes  

The ripcord is a device for securing the container closed  prior to use. It usually consists of a handle, a flexible cable,  one or more pins, and a device for securing the cable to the  handle. Some ripcords use a stiffened cable instead of a pin.  Similar to the ripcord is the main riser retain/release cable/ handle assembly if the parachute is equipped with a main  riser release system, such as the 3-ring release.  

# Deployment Devices for the Main and Reserve  Parachutes  

Deployment devices are designed to provide an orderly  and controlled deployment of the parachute during use.  Typical devices include bags, sleeves, pockets, straps,  diapers, and sliders.  

# Main Parachute Release Mechanism and  Associated Handles or Static Lines  

The main parachute release mechanism has two parts. One  part is attached to the harness and the other to the risers.  

Typically such devices are the 3-ring release or Capewell  releases. These types may utilize a separate release handle  to provide release of both sides with one motion. This cable/ handle assembly consists of a cable to each riser and a  velcro-mounted handle. The cables must be kept lubricated  to function properly. There are several types of cable coatings  used by various manufacturers. Nylon coating, which is  hydroscopic, includes the yellow (Lolon) coated cables and  the clear coated cables. This type of cable should be oiled  frequently as climate conditions dictate. When you pull the  cable between your fingers, if it squeaks like clean hair, then it  needs to be lubricated. The Red or (new) orange-coated cable  is pure FEP Teflon coating and requires no maintenance.  Typically when the cable is removed from its housing, it has  black oil in spots along the cable. This black oil is the residue  of the cutting oil used in the manufacture of the housings. It  is not harmful. In fact, if this black oil is distributed evenly  along the cable, it provides limited lubrication. There is no  need to worry about sand or dirt being attracted to the oil on  the cable as it is more important for the cable to be lubricated  than it is to be clean.  [Figure 2-3]  The reserve may employ  a static line (RSL) that is activated upon cutaway. This is  covered in greater detail later in the chapter.  

![](images/427c3c4aa349c694b6df153fe6c66b4708b5a04a35740b0b82d1e888beb23a93.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Lolon cable is yellow. Teflon cable is red or orange.  

# Risers and Associated Steering Toggles  

Risers are part of the suspension system between the lines and  the harness or load. Generally made of webbing, emergency  parachutes usually have the risers integral to the harness. If  they are detachable and not integral and are being used for  an emergency parachute, they require a cross connector, as  they are tested with only one side connected. Main risers used  on sport or military systems used for intentional jumping  have release mechanisms installed. Steering toggles are  usually design specific to the riser for the type of canopy  installed. Ram air canopies use the steering toggle to lock  the deployment brake. Pulling on the toggle after opening  releases the brake. Premature brake release is a major cause  of malfunctions.  [Figure 2-4]  

![](images/910a5380f7ee755944f82cf530f16deb0c5b6e2490abe9180ed54a5797d9aeb3.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.  Toggle through brake eye and stowed.  

Other Harness/Container Assembly Components  Other components designed to function as part of the harness/ container assembly, such as closing loops, also may be used.  Closing loops used with automatic activation devices (AADs)  on reserve or emergency parachutes are usually design  specific to ensure proper operation of the system.  

# TSO Standards  

The original TSO C23b for parachutes came into existence  in 1949. The specifications were revised in 1984 to C23c  and again in 1994 to C23d. The TSO is a simple two-page  document that specifies the requirements for certification.  This document also references a performance standard that  the parachute must meet. C23b parachutes were tested to  standards under National Aircraft Standards Specifications  NAS-804. When the TSO was revised in 1984, the  specification document was drafted under the auspices of the  Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) S-17 committee as  Aerospace Standard AS-8015. When the TSO was revised  again in 1994, the revised document became AS-8015b with  the original as AS-8015a.  Figure 2-5  is a table showing the  pertinent points of each of the TSO certifications. For a more  thorough study of the documents, refer to Appendix B.  

The TSO system consists of two parts. The first is the  performance standards listed above. This ensures that the  parachute performs as specified. The second is the production  approval, which ensures that the manufacturer is able to  produce the parachute as designed and tested. While minor  design changes are allowed, any major design change must  be submitted to the FAA for approval before implementation.  A major change is anything that affects the airworthiness of  the system of the parachute.  

For the aspiring rigger, the primary purpose of knowing the  TSO system is determining the compatibility of components  when assembling the parachute system. This is necessary  in order to ensure that, besides fitting together properly,  the performance standards are compatible. Under Advisory  Circular (AC) 105-2, Sport Parachute Jumping, “the assembly  or mating of separately approved components may be made  by a certificated and appropriately rated parachute rigger  or parachute loft in accordance with the manufacturer’s  instructions and without further authorization by the  manufacturer or the FAA.” Under these guidelines, there are  certain parameters that must be met. One of them is to ensure  that “the strength of the harness must always be equal to or  greater than the maximum force generated by the canopy  during the certification tests.” Full knowledge of the TSO  documents ensures that the above requirements are met.  

![Figure 2-5.  TSO comparisons.  ](images/890b8cd21fcdbe94e786183cc0ec58f02112583a7c64c31e8270fcc19de0bd56.jpg)  

# Canopy Design  

Accomplished design skills are not necessary for the rigger to  properly service parachutes. The skills involved to become a  designer can take several years of training and practice. It is  necessary, however, that the rigger understands some of the  basic concepts to relate the performance characteristics to the  design theory of the components involved. For the average  rigger, these concepts are accepted as those proven and tested  in the finished product. The following are specific areas that the  rigger should understand to determine the identity, function,  and assembly of parachute components and their interaction.  

Understanding the sequence and method of deployment is  necessary when assembling components to assure proper  function. Most ram air parachutes are trimmed nose down,  and as such the canopy tries to fly over its nose during  deployment. This flight angle causes the top skin nose of the  canopy to roll over the bottom skin leading edge closing off  the cell preventing inflation. To counter this, the trailing edge  of the canopy is deflected downward to apply brakes during  inflation; this holds the nose up and open allowing air intake.  These are called “deployment brakes” and are implemented  by providing a “brake eye” in the steering line of the canopy  located so as to apply the proper amount of brakes. The  steering line is pulled down through the steering guide ring  on the risers and locked with the nose of the steering toggle  during the packing process. Loss of one or both brakes during  opening will most likely cause a malfunction. Loss of one  causes the canopy to turn into that side as the cells remain  collapsed and the inflated side over-flies the collapsed side.  In flight corrective action is to grab both toggles and apply  both brakes evenly and quickly.  

# Nomenclature  

All riggers should become familiar with Parachute Industry  Association (PIA) Technical Standard 100 (TS-100),  Standardized Nomenclature for Ram-Air Inflated Gliding  Parachutes (See Appendix I). This document is the official  language and terminology used for ram-air parachutes. It  specifies the parts of the parachute, the various construction  methods, and the seam configurations used. This is necessary  for the rigger to understand the manuals and repair procedures  provided by the manufacturers for their products.  

Figure 2-6  identifies the components of a typical round  emergency parachute. The nomenclature of this design  has remained constant for several decades with a few  exceptions. While some riggers who skydive think that  the square parachute has replaced it, the round parachute  still has many uses, and in certain instances, fulfills some

mission requirements better than the square parachute.  Poynter’s Parachute Manual, Volume 1, Chapter 8, provides  an excellent discussion of the design parameters and  characteristics of round parachutes for those needing more  technical background.  

# Construction Concepts and Techniques  

TS-100 describes the various ram-air construction methods  such as half-cell chord wise, full-cell “I” beam chord  wise, full-cell interlocking “T” chord wise, and span wise  configurations. When learning the various construction  methods, the beginning rigger can become confused as to how  the seams are folded together. Seeing the schematic diagrams  of the various configurations can help in the repair sequence.  Additionally, there are two basic methods of construction for  the main seam used on modern ram airs. One method is to roll  the adjacent bottom skins with the attendant rib together and  double needle 301 stitch to hold the joint. Line attachment  tabs are then appliquéd over the rolled seam for subsequent  line attachment. The other method is the foil method where  the rib has the line attachment tab attached directly to it and  is flat stitched to the bottom skins allowing the bottom edge  of the rib to be exposed.  

Round parachute construction is divided into two primary  techniques: bias and block construction. Bias construction is  most prevalent in the early parachutes and military designs.  It is generally the stronger of the two techniques due to its  ability to stretch more during opening. In bias construction,  the fabric is cut and sewn so that the warp and filler threads  are at  $45^{\circ}$   to the centerline of the gore. A typical example is  the  $28^{\prime}\,\mathrm{C}.9$   canopy.  

Block construction is where the warp threads of the panels  are parallel to the hem of the canopy. Block construction  gained in popularity in the lightweight sport reserves of  the 1970s and 1980s. They were easier to build and packed  smaller. An example of this design is the Phantom/Aerostar  canopies, manufactured by National Parachute Industries,  Inc. Additionally lines may run from link to link through the  canopy or from skirt to link using reinforcement tape for the  canopy portion of the radial seam.  

# Operational Theory  

The rigger must have knowledge of how the parachute  functions. Without this, the rigger may not be able to  assemble the correct components so that they function as  a complete assembly. While the manufacturer may specify  what components are to be used with their particular design,  with the vast numbers of products on the market today,  there are an infinite number of combinations being used by  the skydiving community. While seeming to be compatible  with each other, many designs have subtle differences that  affect their performance and operation. Such differences  include pilot chute drag capability and bag extraction force  requirements. Pilot chutes should not be interchanged unless  the drag capability and container extraction force is known.  

# Materials  

The materials used in construction have changed over the last  several years. This has resulted in better performance and  durability. The use of incorrect materials can have a detrimental  effect on the opening, flying, and landing characteristics of the  parachute. The growth in popularity of the ram-air canopies in  the 1970s required new fabrics for the designs to function. Very  low permeability fabric was necessary for the canopy to remain  inflated and maintain the aerodynamic airfoil shape. To reduce  the drag created by the suspension lines, newer lightweight and  high-strength materials were used. First Dacron ® , followed  by Kevlar ® , and now Spectra ®  and Vectran ® . While reducing  the line bulk and drag, these materials have introduced newer  problems into the designs.  

The ultra-low permeability fabrics inflate faster and have  almost zero stretch. As a result, the opening forces increase  considerably. These effects have contributed to newer packing  and deployment methods to reduce the loads on the parachutist  and harness. These, in turn, affect the design of the container  systems. Using this as an example, the rigger can see the chain  of cause and effect in the design process. Complete coverage  of materials is presented in Chapter 3 of this handbook.  

# Damage  

Damage patterns identified during the inspection of canopies  can highlight problems caused from packing or incorrect use.  By being able to identify these patterns, the rigger can provide  the user with correct technique and, thereby, prevent possible  injury or death. In addition, the rigger can provide valuable  feedback to the manufacturer of potentially serious problems  with new designs once they have been subjected to real world  conditions. While manufacturers conduct extensive testing  programs before releasing new products to the market, very  often, subtle problems do not arise until the parachute has  been in the field for an extended period of time.  

# Containers  

The container component assembly of the parachute system  is that part which encloses the canopy(s) and lines, the  deployment device (if used), and the pilot chute unless it is  externally mounted as on a “pop top.” It is held closed by  the use of cones or loops, which are secured by ripcord pins  or locking pins such as are used on hand deploy systems.  Containers may consist of single units as are used on pilot  emergency systems or multiple units such as are used on  skydiving piggyback systems. The term “pack” is used  interchangeably with container. The harness and container  assembly may be called the pack and harness. The term  “packtray” is used to refer to the bottom panel or section of  the container where the lines may be stowed during packing.  

Early containers were simply a bag-shaped unit that the  canopy was stuffed into and then tied closed. The parachute  was static line deployed and the parachutist simply fell away  from the balloon or aircraft allowing the canopy to deploy.  With the advent of manually deployed free fall systems, the  need for a more secure and tailored design became evident.  

Originally, the parachute systems were identified by the  position at which they were located in relation to the body  of the user. These were the back parachute, seat parachute,  chest parachute, and lap parachute. The containers were  usually rectangular in shape with four closing flaps. These  configurations were primarily dictated by the need to fit the  assembly into the flighdeck of the aircraft.  

With the growth of skydiving, the container configurations  and the associated terminology changed. The original  location of the main parachute on the back and the reserve on  the chest became known as the “conventional” configuration.  [Figure 2-7]  The original tandem configuration with both  

![](images/a2e498e023a19c39e2481325a6482eb18848cd039b3c18c51579f245d9e7ad3c.jpg)  
Figure 2-7.  Conventional container.  

the main and reserve on the back became known as a  “piggyback,” and the introduction of a two-person parachute  system became the new “tandem.”  [Figure 2-8  and  2-9]  

# Configuration  

When canopies were packed into early bag-type containers,  they always wanted to assume a spherical or round shape.  For the container to remain flat, it was necessary to tailor the  fabric and then use frames or bow stiffeners to keep it flat  and compress the pilot chute. Back designs utilized multiple  cones and pins, usually three or four to maintain the length  and width. Seat containers were usually more square and  thicker since they were held in place by the seat pan. Most  use two cones and pins for closing. The same was used for  chest and lap parachutes. Many military systems still utilize  these basic configurations today.  

With the introduction of skydiving in the 1960s, most  equipment was of modified military designs, and the first  generation of commercial products was simply colored  versions of these designs. In the 1970s, skydiving canopies  had progressed to ram-air designs, which were smaller  in volume and had different deployment requirements.  Container designs evolved to meet these requirements. The  introduction of the hand deploy pilot chute was probably the  

![](images/d2e8a0b997c6a2b6ff8675ae3eb4767880d872a450bc0c8a09ed4878868c7a87.jpg)

most influential concept in the evolving container design.  Cones were replaced by fabric closing loops, and main  ripcords and pins were replaced by hand deploy bridles and  locking pins. It was no longer necessary to compress the  spring-loaded pilot chute inside the container. Thru closing  loops were used to compress the pack and make it thinner to  conform to the body shape. The use of deployment bags and  other devices helped provide shaping to the container. This  was true for both square and round canopies.  

Today, most modern container designs have completely done  away with frames and bow stiffeners. This has resulted in  smaller, more flexible, more comfortable, and more efficient  container designs. Instead of metal stiffeners, nylon plastic  is used to reinforce the container flaps for backing the  grommets. The nylon is lighter, easier to work with, and  cheaper. Many of the modern military designs now follow the  design concepts pioneered by the sport industry as they have  proven better and more cost effective.  Figure 2-10   shows a  modern military container.

# Modern Design Concepts  

The containers of today do more than simply enclose the  canopy and deployment device. Sport containers in particular  need to be designed so that they contribute to the deployment  needs of the specific parachute. Piggyback designs have  separate requirements for the main and reserve containers.  

The reserve container is generally small, tight, and mostly  wedge-shaped. Virtually all popular sport systems are  designed around the use of a ram-air canopy. The deployment  method of choice is a Type 5 deployment bag. In the early  days of the ram-air reserve, there were certain container  design requirements specified by the manufacturers which  are listed below:  

1.	 A hesitator loop configuration secures the bridle  and holds the bag in until the reserve pilot chute is  deployed and under drag.  [Figure 2-11]  

![](images/1a46139985ba1e1880228ec19c3bcf2b0654d8da9fa4cbba249f9d15559c38f3.jpg)  
Figure 2-11.  Square reserve hesitator loop configuration.  

2.	 Nonrestrictive corners to allow the bag to be lifted  off by the bridle in the event of a horseshoe-type  malfunction.  [Figure 2-12]  

![](images/9d0be096035ffe855ebac2f537979aa9881574cf6a277efb2eef86f582c399b6.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.  Non-restrictive container corners.  

These requirements were adhered to for many years. Today,  containers achieve the required holding and deployment  needs through design tailoring. The bottom corners of the  reserve container are designed so that the bag is held in place  while the pilot chute and bridle deploy and then releases the  bag, rotating it out of the container top to bottom into the  airstream. At the same time, the bag can still deploy quickly  in the event of a horseshoe-type malfunction.  

The main container is less restrictive than the reserve in  holding the main canopy in place during deployment. This is  important so that there is no tendency for the bag to twist or  be unstable on deployment. With many of the main canopies  used today, if the bag is unstable, it results in the main  canopy opening unevenly and causing spins and possible  malfunctions. Along with the main bag, the main risers must  be able to deploy evenly for the same reasons.  

In the early days of skydiving, the primary body position  was a stable, face-to-earth position. This resulted in the main  container being behind the parachutist out of the airflow. One  of the primary problems faced during those days was the high  incidence of pilot chute hesitations. This was the result of poor  training and lack of understanding of that air flow. Eventually  skydivers learned to sit up during deployment causing the air  to flow over their back sweeping the pilot chute into the main  stream. Hand deployed pilot chutes were developed to make  packing easier and eliminate the need for a metal ripcord.  

In the face-to-earth position, the primary purpose of the  container is to hold the canopy and pilot chute closed, and  then allow it to open during deployment. Today, body  positions experienced during free fall range from head-down  to feet-to-earth and everything in between. Where speeds  formerly experienced ranged from 110 miles per hour (mph)  to maybe  $140\,\mathrm{mph}$  , today speeds in a head-down position can  exceed  $200\,\mathrm{mph}$  . This has changed the container dynamics to  ensure a more secure system and increased protection from  the wind blast. These changes have resulted in more secure  and streamlined configurations to accommodate these new  requirements.  Figure 2-13  shows a modern container design  shaped to meet the high-speed airflows of today.  

An additional area that needs to be addressed when designing  piggyback systems is the main riser covers. In the early days  of sport piggyback designs, the main risers were held in  position by webbing keepers. As the sport progressed, the use  of fully enclosed main riser covers became the norm. In their  attempt to protect the main risers during high-speed free fall,  some designs tend to restrict the deployment of the reserve  container in the event of a “total” main pack malfunction.  When this happens and the main container remains closed,  the main riser covers do not open. Because of this, there is  additional restriction over the upper corners of the reserve  

![](images/916feb674b0a53c9357a1c3656349de178d4d29ebe87bd509d68e9ad99ed8fbe.jpg)

container. This contributes to higher reserve bag release  forces. In severe cases, this can result in a reserve pilot chute  in tow with potential serious consequences. The balance  between sufficient main riser protection and the requirement  for unhindered reserve deployment is a critical design feature.  

Most modern sport parachute containers have housings of  some sort to accommodate ripcords and riser release cables.  These flexible metal conduits come in 3 basic types in varying  diameters: non-compressible, relaxed, and non-extendable.  The housing type is critical to provide proper protection  and function for the usage. Non-extendable is used for most  ripcord housings, except on Navy seat packs. Relaxed refers  to the ripcord housing that is not completely compressible.  Non-compressible housing is the correct type to use for 3-ring  cutaway systems so the compression does not cause the sides  to release unevenly.  

# Harness Design  

According to Poynter’s Parachute Manual, “the harness is  an arrangement of cotton, linen, nylon, or Dacron ®  webbing,  which is designed to conform to the shape of the load (usually  the body), to be carried in order to secure it properly so that  the opening forces and the weight of the load are evenly  distributed during opening and descent.”  

The earliest harness was nothing more than a swing seat  that the parachutist sat on and then held onto the risers  or suspension straps. It soon became apparent that if the  openings were in any way uneven, it could be very precarious  for the parachutist. While the sling seat worked for the ride  down, it was necessary to add additional straps to secure  the parachutist. These straps included the leg, back, and  chest straps. The standard harness configuration is equipped  to secure a torso, head, arms, and legs with straps. Others  have been added over time for additional purposes, such as  survival kits or cushions.  Figure 2-14  shows a basic military  style harness. This harness configuration has seven points of  adjustment to allow fitting of most military personnel.  

![](images/38de461bf74515d8f7e1b89ff0d35b86769b7c6fb031f6bb58397d19ecf7bfc1.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  Military harness.  

Most of the early parachute systems had the harness detachable  from the containers. This allowed interchange ability for  various models. In the 1970s, skydiving systems began to  integrate the harness into a true harness/container assembly.  This was accomplished by sandwiching the harness between  the container and backpad and sewing them together.  Figure 2-15  shows one of the earliest custom systems called  the “super swooper.” This harness was the precursor of  today’s sport harnesses.  

![](images/eb62644440cd452ebff4dc99e4e8ebfc339b6b38571f550ee9e63b453d75e21a.jpg)  
Figure 2-15.  Super swooper harness.  

As skydiving and the sport parachute industry has grown,  most of the equipment is now custom-built for each  individual. The standard piggyback harness configuration of  today is a fixed main lift web with adjustments only at the  chest and leg straps.  [Figure 2-16]  Elimination of the extra  hardware and webbing has resulted in a dramatic reduction  in weight of modern systems. Along with this has been an  increase in comfort and flexibility. One of the most innovative  designs adopted in recent years is the “articulated” harness.  This design incorporates metal rings at the hip junction and  the chest-strap attachment.  [Figure 2-17]  These rings allow  a full range of motion both in the air and on the ground and  increase the fit and comfort of the harness. Note however that  hardware incorporated into the main lift web or junction of  a harness should be equal in strength to the webbing or at  least the certification of the harness. Type 7 harness webbing  is 6,000 pounds tensile. Type 13 harness webbing is 7,000  pounds tensile. The stainless steel “RW-  $.8"$   is certified to  3,500 pounds. The stainless steel 5010 Harness Ring is  certified to 5,000 pounds.  

The “stepped” harness is not as strong as the continuous  horizontal harness  [Figure 2-18] . If point loading occurs on  a stepped harness, stitching may break, and the junction can  

![](images/414972250e5a1c1e0fca874b6c5dcb3573e872c6d9be2afa4daa8e98e5bd18ae.jpg)  
Figure 2-16.  Standard piggyback harness.  

fail with disastrous results. With a continuous horizontal, if all  the stitching were to fail, the wearer would still be wrapped  in webbing and restrained in the harness.  

In recent years and with the increasing popularity of vertical  skydiving or “free flying,” greater speeds are experienced  with corresponding higher loads on the harnesses. For many  years, harnesses were overbuilt as they were basically copies  of military designs. As the sport has progressed, equipment  has been made lighter and smaller.  

# Bridles and Deployment Devices  

In the early days of parachutes, the lines and canopy were  stowed in the container. During the deployment process, the  canopy was extracted first, followed by the lines. This was  known as a “canopy first” deployment. If the canopy inflated  before tension was applied to the lines, a malfunction was  highly likely and a hard opening shock a certainty. Over the  years, it was learned that the deployment process needed to  be controlled to prevent malfunctions. Hence the introduction  of deployment devices that changed the deployment sequence  to “lines first” by preventing canopy skirt from spreading  until the lines were fully extended.  

At the start of the World War II, with the advent of airborne  paratroops, the main canopy was deployed from a direct  bag static line system. In this system, the main canopy was  packed in a bag that was permanently attached to the static  

![](images/af8fae8793d37a79a89dc403cc48cd59bf149191d107867ab0620d9d4b68b34b.jpg)

line. After deployment, the bag and static line remained  with the aircraft. This system is still used today with some  modifications. For emergency parachutes, the military  adopted the “quarter bag” in the 1950s for use with high- speed emergency systems.  [Figure 2-19]  This was fairly  complicated to pack but effective in controlling the parachute  during opening. In the early 1960s, the sleeve was developed  

![](images/f6ee1580331a2022dfa898e6b171427a5a839d92e066b23a42c0829d15db5392.jpg)  

# Figure 2-19.  Quarter bag.  

and soon became popular for sport parachuting or skydiving.  With the growth of skydiving and the increased use of the  reserve parachute, it soon became obvious that the reserve  parachute needed to be controlled more. In the mid 1970s,  the two-stow diaper was developed for use with emergency  and reserve parachutes. This design was soon followed by  the three-stow diaper and the piglet-style diaper invented by  Hank Ascuitto. During this time period, the deployment bag  became the preferred method of deploying the increasingly  popular ram-air or square canopies. In 1977, Para-Flite, Inc.  introduced the first ram-air reserve canopy, which utilized  the “free bag” deployment system. This design continues  to this day virtually unchanged as the preferred method of  deploying square reserve canopies.  

Reefing devices slow down and stage the opening sequences  of canopies, resulting in lower opening forces. This is  particularly critical at higher speeds where the excessive  “G” forces experienced may injure or kill the user. The  most common reefing device used today is the “slider.”  [Figure 2-20A and B]  This device consists of a piece of  fabric with grommets or rings at the corners through which  the line groups pass. This restricts the inflation of the canopy  and slows down the opening. While other methods have been  developed for military or aerospace applications, the slider is  the preferred method of reefing ram-air canopies. Without this  device, skydiving would not be as developed as it is today.  

# Deployment Types  

There are currently six different types of deployment  methods, which are listed below.  

# Type 1: Canopy First Deployment  

With this method, the lines are stowed vertically or  horizontally in the container. Examples of this method are the  T-7A chest pack or the B-12 back parachute.  [Figure 2-21]  

![](images/a5e11adec32c3103b199cd14092f6ba00c4b3ef7b6121f5e68f6e155cd221b6f.jpg)  
Figure 2-21.  Type 1 deployment—T-7A reserve.  

# Type 2: Two-Stow Diaper or Half Diaper  

This method utilizes split line groups. Two stows from one  line group lock the diaper, compensated by offsetting stows  of the other line group in the container with the remainder of  the lines stowed in the container. Examples of this method  are the early Strong 26' Lo-Po and the Pioneer “K” series  reserves.  [Figure 2-22]  

![](images/bf2f3d082deda8cb2c3e0e1afb38b098e0a55c6b99f150b946fbd75338f8cce3.jpg)

Figure 2-22.  Type 2 deployment—Lo-Po Reserve.  

# Type 3: Ascuitto or Piglet-Style Flat Diaper  

This deployment features a full diaper with all lines stowed  left to right or perpendicular to the radial seam. Examples  of this method are the Piglet, Phantom, and Security Aero  Conical (SAC) canopies.  [Figure 2-23]  

![](images/2fd6a6d14ac69c65b8a69b03c5b2e011a536a0b5401c08950c3c89cccf8b67b0.jpg)  
Figure 2-23.  Type 3 deployment—Phantom canopy.  

# Type 4: Handbury or Preserve Full Diaper  

This features a choker-type diaper that wraps around the  canopy skirt. It is locked with three stows and all lines are  stowed on the diaper parallel to the radial seam. Examples of  this method are the Preserve series canopies, Strong Lo-Po  Lite, and the Hobbit square reserve.  [Figure 2-24]  The military  quarter bag is basically a version of the Type 4 method.  

![](images/1e6cbf002b27298c76047ddc9635b033d5957169893edf629b051f8cd5e6c54d.jpg)  
Figure 2-24.  Type 4 deployment—Preserve diaper.  

# Type 5: Free Bag  

With a free bag, the canopy is stowed in the bag, and lines are  either stowed on or in the bag. They were originally used on  the Safety Flyer reserve. This is the dominant and preferred  method for virtually all modern square reserves.  [Figure 2-25]  

![](images/e59ce73d0dfb0d1a77ef9fe27c8d39b4328d6348c9972ad5c3a4fd872258fd9c.jpg)  
Figure 2-25.  A) Type 5 deployment—Freebag and B) Type 5  deployment—Speedbag.  

# Type 6: Sleeves  

The sleeve type includes a fabric tube that encloses the  full length of the folded canopy. Lines are stowed on the  sleeve. They were originally used on early sport canopies,  particularly the Para-Commander.  [Figure 2-26]  A modern  version, known as a “slag,” is used on some ram-air canopies.  An additional deployment method is the “tail pocket.” This is  a fabric pocket sewn on the tail of a ram-air canopy in which  the lines are stowed.  [Figure 2-27]  

![](images/29a15fbf8d16cdf312d0823c74371ab65415e70824314759def5df9575ccc228.jpg)

Figure 2-27.  Tail pocket.  

# Securing the Deployment Device  

With all deployment methods, it is necessary to properly  fold or stow the canopy and secure the deployment device  with the lines. The early parachutes utilized hesitator loops  to secure the lines.  [Figure 2-28]  This method is still used  today in many military systems.  

![](images/7375b781003d5c34e000f84f4c611dd655db0c3fc8a3ea8896784bf4f05df691.jpg)  
Figure 2-28.  Hesitator loops.  

In modern designs that utilize types 1 through 4 and 6,  the preferred method of locking the deployment device is  rubber bands. The specification for standard rubber bands  is MIL-R-1832. Type 1 are made of natural rubber and are   $\%\times2"$  . These were designed for use with the thicker Type  III nylon lines such as on the   $28^{\prime}\,\mathrm{C}.9$   canopy. Many of the  newer lightweight, round canopies use smaller diameter and  fewer lines. Consequently, the standard rubber bands do not  work well. Some manufacturers supply smaller,  $1\%"$   diameter  rubber bands to be used with their canopies. It is extremely  important to utilize the correct size rubber bands.  

With the introduction of the free bag system in 1977, Para- Flite, Inc., used a BUNA-N “O” ring to secure the locking  stows.  [Figure 2-29]  During testing of the free bag system,  they found inconsistent holding and breaking strengths of  rubber bands. They wanted the locking stows to release at a  consistent force to prevent bag lock. The “O” rings provided  this. A couple of years later, the “O” rings were upgraded to  a thicker diameter model. In 1983, Para-Flite, Inc. replaced

the “O” rings with the Safety Stow ® . The Safety Stow ®  is  a continuous loop of elastic shock cord that runs through a  webbing channel and through two grommets to secure the  first two locking stows.  [Figure 2-30]  In the event of any  restriction on the locking stow, as the loop stretches, it allows  first one side to release and then the opposite side.

It is important to maintain the rubber bands or Safety Stow ® Rubber bands are susceptible to heat degradation and may dry  out. If they break prematurely during use, the parachute may  malfunction. Non-mil. specification rubber bands may react to  natural brass grommets and may become gummy and sticky,  causing the lines to stick to the diaper or bag. Rubber bands  should be replaced during routine Inspection and Repack.  [Figure 2-31A and B]  The BUNA-N “O” rings should be  replaced with the Safety Stow ® . The Safety Stow ®  should  be inspected for broken stitching or internal rubber strands.  [Figure 2-32]  

In response to occasional violent openings on ram-air  canopies, Parachute Labs (Jump Shack) in 2003 introduced  the “speed bag” to eliminate “line dump” (line strip). The  lines are retained in rubber bands 25 percent in from the edge  of the bag. This balances the mass of the stows between the

bights and center span of the stow. The bag has an additional  flap on the top side that has slots for the rubber bands mounted  on the bottom flap. These two flaps overlap closing the bag  over the canopy. The design was used on main canopies  only for the first three years. Its success led to the release as  a reserve bag in 2006.  

# Bridles  

The bridle is a cord or webbing strap that is used to connect  the pilot chute to the canopy or deployment device. Main  and reserve bridles, while sharing the same function,  operate differently.  

Early bridles were simply a length of suspension line tied off  to the two components. It was soon learned that the length  of the bridle affected the function of the pilot chute and  the opening characteristics of the canopy. On most round  emergency and reserve parachute assemblies, the length and  type of the bridle is fixed for optimum performance. The  rigger cannot change the configuration of the bridle without  approval of the manufacturer.  

There are two basic types of round canopy bridles. The first  is a tubular nylon bridle that is tied on. The second is a pre- sewn bridle with loops at each end. The loop of one end is  passed through the attach point on the pilot chute and then  back through itself forming a lark’s head knot. The other  loop of the bridle is then similarly attached to the canopy  apex.  [Figure 2-33]  With this type, it is essential for the  loop to remain loose to ensure the bridle is free floating and  self-centering around the apex lines. Hand tack the loop to  ensure this.  [Figure 2-34]  

![](images/76852f20a16a4e3fa081029e3c0e11b55576112cb122a872a14b4caaddcf53b3.jpg)

Figure 2-34.  Hand tack floating bridle loop.  

Square reserve bridles are generally built into the free bag. The  bridle material is usually 2 feet wide or more for high drag. The  original concept of the free bag is to allow the square reserve  to deploy if the reserve pilot chute is captured resulting in a  horseshoe-type malfunction. The high-drag bridle would then  pull the reserve bag off the parachutist’s back and allow the  canopy to deploy free from the bag. In the late 1980s, assistor  pockets were added to some bridles for additional drag as  square reserves became bigger and heavier.  [Figure 2-35]  

![](images/6d581111b9126bbebee6d20c9cd09c4a7b8117db790cc62f9c32187d241e6898.jpg)  
Figure 2-35.  Freebag assistor pocket.  

Early main bridles were simply longer versions of the reserve  bridles. This was necessary to compensate for the “burble”  created in free fall by the parachutist. In the mid 1970s and  with the advent of the hand deploy pilot chute, the length of  the bridle was critical in order to allow proper extraction of  the locking pin that secured the pack closed.  

In recent years and with the almost total use of ram-air  parachutes, the need for collapsible main pilot chutes has  become widespread. As the main canopies have become  smaller and faster, the drag of the inflated main pilot  chute after opening can have an adverse effect on canopy  performance. This problem has been solved through the  use of a collapsible pilot chute/bridle system. There are two  primary designs used to accomplish this.  

The first is the “bungee” collapsible configuration. This  consists of a length of elastic shock cord inside a tape sheath  on the bridle near the pilot chute end.  [Figure 2-36]  When  relaxed, it holds the apex of the pilot chute collapsed. When the  

![](images/4bbc87295099d9cdd44e86e6b680b0d561e8d11fe22147792a0edc1ade321a1b.jpg)  
Figure 2-36.  Bungee collapsible bridle.  

pilot chute is deployed into the airstream, the airflow inflates  the pilot chute, which deploys the canopy. After opening, the  elastic pulls the apex down again and collapses the pilot chute,  reducing the drag. While this system works, its main drawback  is that certain airspeeds are needed to inflate the pilot chute.  Remember, the primary function of the pilot chute is to initiate  deployment. Collapsing the pilot chute is secondary.  

The second type is the “kill-line collapsible” configuration. This  consists of a bridle with a full length channel through which  passes a line of Kevlar ®  or Spectra ® .  [Figure 2-37]  The bridle  is “cocked” and the lower end of the bridle is collapsed during  packing. This allows the pilot chute to inflate immediately.  During the deployment sequence, as the canopy inflates, the  lower end is stretched to length and the centerline pulls the apex  of the pilot chute down and collapses it. This configuration  has become almost universal in use for skydiving today. The  only drawback is if the user forgets to cock the bridle during  packing. This results in a collapsed pilot chute and a pilot chute  in tow. In the early days of use of the kill-line bridle, this was  a problem but has become less frequent today. Some bridles  have a colored “eye” at the locking pin location to show if it  is cocked and the centerline is set correctly.  [Figure 2-38]  

![](images/c00dc920794743ee3bea391b235e42f3c8a99eb06aa6c3284eacb08f79b684fb.jpg)

Figure 2-38.  Kill-line eye or window.  

The kill-line configuration is used almost exclusively on  tandem systems due to the high speeds involved and the size  of the drogue pilot chutes. Some bridles are made from  $2"$  Kevlar ®  tape and have tubular nylon centerlines. Others are  made from Type 4 square weave with a Spectra centerline.  The advantage of the latter is that it can be cut with a hook  knife in the event of an on-person malfunction.  [Figure 2-39]  

![](images/12b574cb50c1de2ec318dcdcedf623a08f356889a06391a4068b6479f993954e.jpg)  
Figure 2-39.  Tandem main collapsible bridle.  

Another method of collapsing the pilot chute is to install a No.  8 grommet in the deployment bag and allow the bag to float  on the bridle. After the canopy deploys, the bag slides up the  bridle, inverts, and covers the pilot chute. This is commonly  called the “poor man’s collapsible pilot chute system.” The  drawback to this design is the high wear on the bridle and  pilot chute mesh.  

# Pilot Chutes  

A pilot chute is a small parachute  that is used to deploy the  main or reserve parachute. In the earliest uses of parachutes,  the parachute was static line deployed. With the advent of  manually operated or “free fall” parachutes, the need for a  pilot chute was quickly recognized.  

There are two basic types of pilot chutes. The first is the  spring-loaded design. This uses a collapsible spring, which  is compressed in the parachute container and held closed  with the ripcord. When the ripcord is pulled, the pack opens  and the pilot chute launches into the airstream. The pilot  chute provides drag and pulls the canopy from the pack as  the parachutist or load falls away. During this process, the  pilot chute also provides tension on the lines of the deploying  canopy and helps the opening sequence. Spring-loaded  pilot chutes are used primarily for emergency and reserve  parachutes. In addition, they are used in military free fall and  training systems for the main parachute.  

The second type of pilot chute is the “hand deploy” design.  This type consists of the pilot chute canopy but does not have  a spring to launch it. Instead, the parachutist extracts the  folded pilot chute from a pouch or the container and launches  it into the airstream. The pack is held closed by a locking pin  attached to the bridle of the pilot chute. As the pilot chute  inflates, it extracts the pin from the locking loop and pulls  the parachute from the pack. The rest of the opening process  is similar to the spring-loaded pilot chute. This configuration  came into popularity in the mid 1970s and is now the primary  method of deployment in skydiving.  

# Spring-Loaded Pilot Chutes  

Spring-loaded pilot chutes date from the 1920s. However,  it was not until 1940 that the spiral vane pilot chute was  invented. This design used a spiral spring that is easy to  collapse and pack. The most common type of spiral vane pilot  chute used today is the MA-1 model.  [Figure 2-40A and B]   This is used in several military parachute assemblies. In the  early days of skydiving, military pilot chutes, such as the  MA-1 and others were popular. Soon commercial designs  were introduced that improved on the MA-1 with better  launch and drag characteristics. These included the Grabber ®   and Hot  $\mathbf{D}\log^{\circledast}$   pilot chutes. Both of these were primarily for  use with main parachutes.  

With the advent of the hand deploy pilot chute for the main,  most of the improvement in spring-loaded pilot chute design  has focused on its use in the reserve or emergency parachutes.  This has paralleled the improvements in container design and  the increased use of AADs. Both of these require better pilot  chutes than in the past.  

One example for reserve use is the Magnum ®  pilot chute  designed by National Parachute Industries.  [Figure 2-41] With its unique shape, it provides maximum drag at low  speeds, such as are experienced during cutaways. Its design  has been licensed by other manufacturers for use in their  assemblies. Additional designs include the Vector II reserve  pilot chute and the Stealth pilot chute. The Vector II design is  a “ballute” configuration that eliminates the use of mesh. In  the event of an unstable launch on its side, the mass of fabric  is sufficient to lift the pilot chute and deploy the parachute.  The Stealth pilot chute uses a conventional mesh design but  has a unique spring/cap configuration that allows the pilot  chute to virtually disappear when packed, hence the name.  The MA-1 spring with mesh in place of the vanes, and a  closed canopy instead of the scalloped canopy provides the  best of both worlds: a spring that does not lock up on itself  and high drag without the possibility of snag.  

# Hand Deploy Pilot Chutes  

The hand deploy pilot chute was introduced in 1976. There  are two types of hand deploy designs. One is the throw-out  pilot chute (TOP) configuration. This is the type where  the pilot chute pulls the locking pin located on the bridle.  [Figure 2-42]  The original design had the pilot chute pouch  

![](images/64bb43e3e1f00273757ceaf13d18fc3fae81e672d6f762400ab3b13ed22404c5.jpg)  
Figure 2-40.  A) MA-1 pilot chute and B) high-drag pilot chute with large hole mesh.  

mounted on the belly band. Today, the primary location is an  elastic/Spandex ®  pocket mounted on the bottom of the main  container (BOC).  [Figure 2-43]  Most of the difficulties of this  design have to do with pilot chute in tow due to misrouting  of the bridle or failure of the pin to extract.  

The second type is the pull-out pilot chute (POP) configuration.  This design has the pilot chute packed in the container, which  is locked with a straight locking pin attached to a short lanyard  and handle.  [Figure 2-44A and B]  This handle is usually  mounted on the bottom corner of the main container. The  parachutist grasps the handle and pulls the locking pin from  the locking loop and puts the pilot chute into the airstream. The  handle is usually attached to the bottom of the pilot chute and  as the chute enters the airstream, the jumper loosens his grip  on the handle allowing it to be pulled from his or her hand.  This makes for a positive deployment. The main drawback to  this system is losing the handle due to it being dislodged while  moving around in the aircraft or in the air. Fortunately, the  handle does not go far and is easy to obtain because it is on a  short lanyard that is tucked up under the side flap. .  

# Automatic Activation Devices (AADs) and  Reserve Static Lines (RSLs)  

Safety considerations have led to the development of AADs  and reserve static line (RSL) systems. These devices allow  for automatic deployment of the main or reserve parachutes  in the event of an emergency.  

# Automatic Activation Devices  

AADs are devices that activate the parachute automatically.  Modern systems combine a barometric sensor with a rate  of descent sensor so that the system is fully automatic once  turned on and calibrated. The activation may be by either  pulling the ripcord pin(s) or cutting the locking loop(s),  

![](images/460f3afce1ed74e69aed6838782b5914c92efa8a179882640d09ba402974b59c.jpg)  
Figure 2-41.  Magnum pilot chute.  

causing the pilot chute to release. Most older models use  a mechanical or pyrotechnic pin pulling technique. Newer  models use a pyrotechnic loop cutting design.  

For many years, AADs were primarily used by the  military and student parachutists. The designs were bulky,  expensive, and, to a degree, inconsistent. The installations  themselves were cumbersome and awkward. In the early  1990s, a new generation of AADs became available. The  CYbernetic Parachute RElease System (CYPRES ® ) uses  modern parachute release technology. It is small, reliable,  computer based, and uses a pyrotechnic loop cutter. It has  an auto-off feature that turns the unit off after 14 hours  of operation to conserve power. It also has the ability to  calibrate the unit for operation at altitudes other than the  calibrating ground level. Based on these concepts, other  companies have developed similar systems and as a result,  changed the approach to the design and use of AADs.  Today, a good many sport parachutists use an AAD and  some countries (rightly or wrongly), mandate their use by  all parachutists.

Figure 2-43.  BOC pocket location.  

The following describes the operation and installation  requirements of the   $\mathbf{C Y P R E S^{\mathfrak{G}}}$   model AA. Other designs,  such as the   $\mathrm{Vigill}^{\mathfrak{G}}$  , are compatible with these installation  requirements.  

# Operation  

The CYPRES ®  system is a barometrically controlled  microprocessor that activates a pyrotechnic cutter that cuts  the container locking loop. When calibrated to ground  level, the barometric sensor activates the unit firing the  cutter when the descending parachutist reaches an altitude  of approximately 750 feet above ground level (AGL) and  exceeds a rate of descent of 115 feet per second (fps).  

The CYPRES ®  consists of three parts:  

1. Battery and processing unit  2. Control unit  3. Cutter  [Figure 2-45]  

![](images/407e4a712d9b46403012ce4ca82a94ee897ece86441a5a5575e213b8a8f21467.jpg)

Figure 2-45.  CYPRES ®  AAD.  

The processing unit is generally located in a stowage pouch  installed in the reserve container of the parachute system.  [Figure 2-46]  The control unit is contained in a vinyl pocket  located either under the pin protector flap or in the upper back  pad area.  [Figure 2-47]  

![](images/5f865f04c058d29b7d919cc5b0495d4de27b031f8033016e33b1c12345e14c7f.jpg)

The cutter(s) may be located at the base of the pilot chute  or on a flap over the pilot chute.  [Figure 2-48]  Each  parachute system has its own particular requirements, and  it is imperative that the rigger have the appropriate manuals  for installation.  

![](images/0e9115e50bea5c49a3855b41e9fe42db6993e98986bf55088626bbb6a263d6e1.jpg)

# Reserve Static Line (RSL) Systems  

A RSL system is a backup device for activating the reserve  after a cutaway is performed. It usually consists of a line,  webbing, or cable, which connects one or both main risers to  the reserve handle, housing, or cable. The most common design  used today has a ring through which the reserve ripcord cable  is routed. The riser end attaches to a ring on the riser(s) with  a snap shackle for quick release capability. When the risers  are jettisoned, the lanyard pulls the cable, releasing the ripcord  pin(s), and activates the reserve. This results in a minimum  loss of altitude during the cutaway procedure. The use of an  RSL has saved many lives over the years due to low cutaways.  

Though originally developed in 1964, as the Stevens  System, the RSL concept did not become popular until the  advent of student piggyback systems and ram-air canopies.  Through the use of an RSL system, the student parachutist  need only pull the canopy release handle in the event of a  partial malfunction, and the main canopy is cutaway and the  reserve activates. In 1990, the PIA urged manufacturers to  include RSLs as a standard feature on all harness/container  systems. Many did and this resulted in an increase of RSL  use for several years.  

Conventional (chest mounted) parachute systems utilized  a cross-connector at the junction of the riser to the lines of  the canopy on each of the front and rear risers. This was so  as to maintain drag if one side release before the other. The  maximum amount of drag available is required to assure  the reserve ripcord activation by the RSL and the release  and separation of the off side riser. When applied to the  piggy back, these cross connectors would hang up on the  bottom of the reserve container preventing separation. Many  manufacturers dismissed this need and elected to provide  a reserve lanyard that was side sensitive (in that it would  activate the reserve if the attached side released and the  opposite side did not release). Others moved the lanyard to  the base of the riser, which required only one cross connector.  This location avoided the possibility of a hang up on the  bottom of the reserve and retained the drag integrity.  

In recent years and with the widespread acceptance of newer  types of AADs, many parachutists feel that they no longer  need an RSL. In reality, both systems complement each other.  The AAD functions if the individual does not activate the  main parachute. However, it is altitude and rate of descent  (ROD) dependent. Below a certain altitude, if the ROD  is not met, the AAD will not function. Consequently, if a  cutaway is performed below the activation altitude, it may  take some time for the descending parachutist to reach the  ROD necessary to initiate activation, thereby necessitating  rapid manual activation of the reserve. However, if an RSL  is also installed, it would cause an immediate activation of  the reserve as the main parachute disconnects and moves  away from the parachutist.  

In the last few years, as canopy design has resulted in smaller  and more sensitive canopies, many parachutists have elected  not to use an RSL. The rationale is that in a violently spinning  malfunction, which some of these highly loaded canopies are  prone to do, it is preferable to cutaway and regain stability  prior to pulling the reserve. This reduces the chance of an  entanglement with the deploying reserve. While this scenario  has happened, it is a rare occurrence. Statistics show that  many lives have been saved by using an RSL.  

# RSL Designs  

There are four primary design configurations of RSLs in use  today and are listed below:  

1. 	 A single-side RSL where the lanyard is attached to  only one main riser, usually the left side.  [Figure 2-49] Only the one side is required to release to activate the  system. This is the most common design in use today  due to its simplicity.  

![](images/3e7d3b1c8fc6eaa29ba00c5fe29a43f72a1320a9d3b9c5f671724511e6755cd5.jpg)  
Figure 2-49.  Single-side RSL configuration.  

2.	 A dual side RSL where both main risers are connected  with a cross connector which is the RSL lanyard.  [Figure 2-50A  and  $B J$   Both risers need to release for  the system to activate.  

3.	 The LOR system developed by the French. This  incorporates two lanyards, one from each riser, that  are attached to individual curved pins that secure  the reserve container with a dual locking loop.  [Figure 2-51]  Both risers must be released for the  system to function.  

![](images/834ef76f83054e92ce8c61f9f2db85df948768041e4dd7f3b69493ce4c352f3e.jpg)  
Figure 2-50.  A) Dual-side RSL configuration and B) dual-RSL  routing diagram.  

4. 	 The Collins Lanyard/Skyhook™ system. This design  utilizes a special lanyard that is attached to the bridle  of the reserve free bag.  [Figure 2-52]  Cutting away  results in the free bag being pulled directly out of the  container by the main risers and results in very little  altitude loss.  

Since the early 1990s, most (if not all) manufacturers have  provided an RSL installation on their equipment either as  standard or optional. If the rigger has a system without an RSL  

![](images/b44c727b28dfab41ee30488632fb80d7f4c21079c22a9f03a100c28bd10ec9ba.jpg)

Figure 2-52.  Skyhook ®  system.  

and the owner wishes to have one installed, the rigger should  check with the manufacturer as to the availability of a retrofit  kit or return it to the manufacturer for installation. Because the  installation of an RSL is an alteration to the original design, the  rigger needs approval either from the manufacturer or the FAA.  

Because of the nature of the RSL system, it is imperative that  the rigger thoroughly understands the individual concepts.  Unless he or she understands this and has the required  manufacturer’s instructions, the rigger should not attempt  to assemble and pack a system with an RSL installation.  The following describes the basic design and function of a  single side RSL installation on a one-pin reserve container.  

# Main Riser Attachment  

The main risers must have an attachment location for the  lanyard. In this example, a small ring is installed near the lower  hardware end of the riser on the inboard side.  [Figure 2-53]  It is  

![](images/2fa97bbee4fc527f821af1a2f0fe79871a6ffde80e6c77c4f5cd6ad73413d974.jpg)  
Figure 2-53.  Main riser RSL ring attachment.  

desirable to locate the ring as close to the lower end as possible  so that the pivot arc of the rise does not load the lanyard.  This allows the riser end of the lanyard end to be as short as  possible. If there is excess lanyard, it is difficult to stow, and  it is possible for the lanyard to become snagged and unseated.  It is important that the correct risers with attachment ring be  installed. While many risers have a ring installation, not all  are installed at the correct location. Consequently, the lanyard  length will not match the factory dimensions. This can result  in premature reserve activation when the main is deployed.  

Most RSL lanyard designs have a snap shackle or similar release  device mounted at the riser end of the lanyard.  [Figure 2-54]   This allows the user to disconnect the lanyard under certain  circumstances. The most common one involves landing in  

![](images/266808f4447efc3c9d4b21888003d77fb92bd4375f7594e90bd6700527f448d2.jpg)  
Figure 2-54.  Snap shackle on RSL lanyard.  

high winds where the parachutist may wish to cutaway the  main canopy to prevent being dragged. If the lanyard were not  released, the reserve would be deployed as the main is cutaway.  

# Ripcord Cable Routing  

The routing of the ripcord cable from the handle to the pin  determines where the lanyard connects to the cable. Most  RSL attachments connect with the ripcord cable either at the  yoke area or just above the ripcord pin. Generally, there is a  double ring installation where the cable end of the lanyard  is located.  [Figure 2-55]  On this particular installation, the  connection is at the shoulder yoke area.  

![](images/7dd1d2915228a16e0fe0513fc5873adbe5cb07f138b9be6ccb66632d65ce487e.jpg)  
Figure 2-55.  Double-ring container installation.  

# RSL Lanyard and Container Mount  

These two components are interactive. That is, the design of  the container directly affects the design of the lanyard. Once  the two above locations are determined, then the routing of  the lanyard can be completed. It was originally thought that  the lanyard should have a long length to allow acceleration  during activation to pull the ripcord cable. This has not proven  to be true and most manufacturers keep their lanyards as short  as possible to prevent snagging and easier stowing. The Racer  cross-connector/lanyard is so sized as to not pull the reserve  ripcord until both risers have separated  

In the past, a Velcro ®  pathway was used for routing the  lanyard. This was either on the shoulder yoke or the reserve  riser. Experience has shown that the use of Velcro ®  generally  results in high wear and eventual damage to the webbing.  [Figure 2-56]  On this design, the lanyard is stiffened with a  short piece of coated cable and stowed in two pockets located  on the yoke area.  [Figure 2-57]  It is secure and has no wear  points. The ripcord end of the lanyard is routed to the dual  guide ring attachment location and the ripcord cable routed  through the rings.

aware of is the “pigtail” configuration of the reserve ripcord  that results from the use of the RSL.  [Figure 2-60]  Because  of the sliding of the ring along the ripcord cable, a curling  effect is imparted to the cable. This is a clear indication that  the RSL lanyard activated the reserve. The rigger should  carefully inspect the ripcord cable for any broken strands.  If any are found, the ripcord should be replaced. If not, the  cable can be straightened and returned to service.  

With the single side RSL, it is imperative that the main  riser with the RSL attachment leave after the opposite  riser. If the opposite riser stays connected while the RSL

deploys the reserve, there is the possibility of a main/reserve  entanglement. To ensure the correct staging of the cutaway,  the release cable of the RSL side must be longer than the cable  on the opposite riser. A minimum of 1 inch is the standard  differential.  [Figure 2-61]  If non-compressible housings are  not used, the staged separation is not reliable.

# Joint Efficiency  

Joint efficiency is the percentage of the measurement of  strength when applied to the junction or fabrication of two  or more materials. An example is the cross seam in a canopy  gore where two panels of fabric are joined. The strength of  the seam needs to be greater than the strength of the fabric.  

To achieve this, there are several factors that need to be  considered in the design. These include the following:  

• 	 Fabric—the weight and weave of the fabric affects  the type of junction used. • 	 Thread type—this is affected by the weight of the  fabric. Generally, the lighter the fabric, the smaller  the thread used. Accordingly, a smaller needle is used  in order not to damage the weave of the fabric. • 	 Stitch type—this is determined by the type of seam  needed for the design. For the French fell seam  normally used in joining the panels of a canopy, the  301 straight stitch is used. • 	 Stitches per inch—this has a direct correlation to the  size of the thread used and the stitch type. There is  a fine balance between the security of the seam and  overstitching. Too many stitches per inch dramatically  affects the strength of the seam by perforating the  material. The number of rows of stitching also affects  this. While more rows generally increase the strength  of the seam, too many perforate the material as well. • 	 Thread tension—as lighter fabric and thread are used,  the thread tension balance becomes more important. • 	 Reinforcing—the addition of reinforcing through  the use of tapes, cords, etc., adds to the strength of  the seam. However, their use may also reduce the  elasticity of the seam at the same time.  

• 	 The stitch pattern used and length. A W–W pattern is  stronger than a box X pattern. • 	 The number of times the webbing is re-sewn.  

All of these affect the ultimate strength of the webbing junction  or stitch pattern.  

# Chapter Summary  

It is important to know the history of parachute design in  order to move forward technologically. The old saying,  “Those who don’t know history are destined to repeat it.” Is  especially applicable to parachute design and manufacture,  where a relatively small, esoteric group of individuals who  are loosely controlled and turn on a dime, churn out designs  that some eager young test jumper is willing to try. This is  not necessarily a bad thing. The civilian led sport parachute  market is responsible for just about all the newest innovations  in the industry over the past 45 years. But it should be kept  in mind that a new design generally takes about ten years’  wringing out in the field to discover it’s failure modes and  make it safe and reliable.  

Some of the previous factors also can affect heavier materials,  such as tapes and webbings. In working with webbings in  harness design, most construction methods have tended  to overbuild the junctions. This has been done primarily  because the materials have readily accepted heavier threads  and stitch patterns.  

An area that needs to be addressed is that of re-stitching  webbing. Until recently, there was not much study done  to determine how much strength is lost in this process.  G.S. Dunker, a parachute engineer, conducted a study that  evaluated the variables introduced when re-stitching webbing  junctions. Some of these variables included the following:  

• 	 The treatment or conditioning of the webbing.  Condition R webbing has a resin treatment to make it  stiffer as opposed to condition U or untreated webbing. • 	 The size and condition of the needle used in the  sewing. Larger needles make larger holes. A blunt  needle or one whose point is damaged, will do more  damage to the webbing and weaken it. • 	 The size of the thread used.  

# Chapter 3 Materials  

# Introduction  

The correct identification and use of the various materials in  parachute manufacturing and repair are of vital importance to  all riggers. Just as important as acquiring knowledge of tools  and machines, knowing and using the correct terminology  for materials is essential to the rigger’s job comprehension.  In doing repairs or alterations, the rigger must be able to  identify the types of materials used in order to duplicate the  original manufacture and to ensure the correct level of safety  necessary. Some materials may look similar, but there can be  subtle differences between them that make a major difference  in their strength or durability.  

It is not the intent of this chapter to present information on  every type of material or hardware ever used in parachutes.  For very detailed specifications on a broader range of  materials used in current production parachutes, as well as  obsolete and military surplus parachutes, there are additional  reference sources, such as “The Parachute Manual” by Dan  Poynter. The purpose of this chapter is to present as much  information on the essentials of modern materials seen in  today’s parachute systems.  

Many riggers operate quite successfully with a basic level  of material knowledge in their proverbial tool kit. There are  certain materials that are commonly used on most parachute  systems, and in dealing with these on a regular basis, the  rigger becomes very familiar with their characteristics and  proper application. It is fundamental that the rigger know  their correct type, nomenclature, strength, and common use.  In dealing with other riggers, manufacturers, and suppliers,  the rigger is then able to identify the referenced material in  order to obtain the appropriate repair part or describe the use  of the material to others. All of this is part of the parachute  rigger’s lexicon, required to communicate their needs and  accomplish the required tasks.  

# Specifications  

All certificated parachute systems built under government  approval programs require most, if not all, materials used  in their construction to have some form of specification  approval. The most common of these systems is the military  specification (MIL-SPEC) system. In addition, there are other  government specifications, such as Federal Standards, and  commercial specifications in use. The MIL-SPEC system  is the one with which most riggers are familiar. Contrary  to popular perception, not all materials for use in parachute  manufacturing must be MIL-SPEC. Any specification may be  used, provided that the manufacturer can prove compliance  with this specification, and that the specification is acceptable  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for use in  the parachute system. As a rule, the MIL-SPEC system has  proven the most readily available and accepted method.  

In recent years, the government has been accepting more  commercial specifications in lieu of MIL-SPEC items. In  2002, the Parachute Industry Association (PIA) adopted  approximately 270 parachute-related specifications, drawings,  standards, and test methods. The PIA takes responsibility for  the continued maintenance and revision of these specifications.  As the specifications are revised, they keep their original  identification number, but the PIA prefix precedes them.  For instance, MIL-W-4088 webbing becomes PIA-W-4088.  Through the involvement of the PIA Specifications Committee,  the revised specifications, including new digital drawings, are  made available to the industry.  

The MIL-SPEC or PIA-SPEC system of identification  consists of the initial letters MIL or PIA with a middle letter  such as W for webbing or wire, then the identification or  serial number of the specification. In addition, there may be  a revision letter, such as A, B, C, D, etc. In the case of PIA- W-4088D, this is the fourth revision.  

The materials and hardware listed herein are only a small  part of those available, but the most commonly used in  the majority of today’s rigging profession. By learning  the specifications and uses of these materials, the rigger  establishes a sound basis for the repair and maintenance of  modern parachutes.  

To promote the latest specifications, the PIA nomenclature  is called out unless otherwise noted. In the past, the common  method to denote the various types of webbings, cords, etc.,  was to use the Roman numeral for the type (e.g., Type VIII  for Ty-8, Type XVII for Ty-17). For this handbook, the  standard is the Arabic numeral (e.g., Ty-7).  

Many of the figures in this chapter use a neutral background  with an XY grid for reference. The numbers are in one-inch  increments for a proportional reference.  

# Fabrics  

Nylon is the predominate fabric used in the manufacture  of parachutes. Chemically speaking, nylon is made of  repeating units linked by amide bonds and is frequently  referred to as a polyamide (PA). It was invented in the late  1930s by Wallace Carothers while conducting research  at DuPont. There are many different kinds of nylon and  some of the major differences include the weave, weight,  and finish. The various types of materials include canopy  fabric, pack cloth, tapes, webbings, mesh, elastic fabrics,  stiffener materials, and foams.  

Canopy fabrics are primarily ripstop nylon. Ripstop weave is  a plain weave with heavier threads woven into the material at  right angles resulting in a boxlike pattern. The heavier thread  and the unique weave results in ability of the threads to slide  over one another inhibiting the tearing process and results in  stronger fabrics.  [Figures 3-1  through  3-6]  

The composition of most containers is from either nylon duck  (Para-pack) or Cordura ® . Para-pack has a smooth somewhat  shiny finish; Cordura has a matte, more rugged appearance.  Both are sturdy and long lasting. Most sport containers also  utilize a thin foam lining on the inside of the flaps to smooth  out the fabric and absorb wear and tear. Other fabrics, such  as mesh, Spandex ® , and ballistic fabric, serve specialized  purposes.  [Figures 3-7  through  3-16]

# Webbing and Tapes  

While many webbings and tapes have the same specifications,  they still have different designations. The difference is a  common rule of thumb where anything 1 inch or wider and  over 1000-lb strength is webbing. Anything less is a tape. There  are, however, some examples that fall outside of this criterion.  

The primary use for webbing is for load bearing purposes,  such as harnesses and risers. Tapes are for use as support and  reinforcing for canopies and containers. Most webbing and  tapes, when manufactured, are left in their natural, untreated  condition (condition U), or treated with a synthetic resin

named Merlon, for stiffness (condition R). A newer treatment,  called “Ecco,” is similar to a light condition R. This is a newer  treatment that is ecologically friendlier than using Merlon.  It also results in a medium stiffness that is easier to sew.  This is for use primarily in the lighter weight tapes, such as  3 ⁄ " Ty-3. Recently some harness/container manufacturers  4 have begun to replace  $\%"$   Ty-3 binding tape with   $\%"$   Ty-3  because modern container designs are getting thicker with  the application of more stiffeners and more padding. There  are pros and cons to this trend.

# Webbing Selection  

When a repair requires replacement of webbing and tapes,  care must be taken to use the correct webbing or tape for  the job. Generally, there are two types of webbings used  in industry: needle weave and shuttle weave. Remember  this: “Needle Never, Shuttle Sure.” This is because  needle weave webbing is rarely, if ever, used in personnel  parachute assemblies.  

![](images/d32f3259d03d13a28279b24454315e90cb44cb3ef8224a6b0d90bd8ab431340d.jpg)

Figure 3-8.  Cloth, nylon, Cordura ®  

The reason for this limitation is because of the reaction of the  webbing when “edge nicked” while under tension. In tests  of the most advanced needle weave products several years  ago, it was dramatically demonstrated, numerous times, that  the webbing would fail catastrophically when the edge was  nicked with sharp metal while under tension.  

![](images/2c6a23270c4544f5d9bd6c6a01a87594fc2f7c33d7d2b9974a6be0720af39708.jpg)

Figure 3-10.  Cloth, duck, nylon, ballistic.  

The two types may be identified by comparing their edges.  Fold the webbing in half and align the selvage edges. They  should be identical in weave. If they are, then it is shuttle  weave and acceptable for use. If they are not, then it is  needle weave.

One should never be substituted for the other in a repair.  The rigger should have material certification and lot  tractability for any materials used in the repair. The  material certification should additionally identify the type.  [Figures 3-17  through  3-32]

# Cords, Lines, and Threads  

The most common uses of cord and lines are the suspension  lines of the canopy. There are many different types in use.  Today, the most common are nylon, Dacron, and Spectra ® The rigger needs to know the different types and their uses.  Each may have special techniques to work with them.

Figure 3-24.  Type-17 Webbing.  

Almost all cords, lines, and threads are constructed of Nylon,  again because of its inherent strength and relative elasticity.  [Figures 3-33  through  3-43]

# Hardware  

Hardware, as defined in the context of parachutes, is “all  metal parts associated with parachutes, their systems, and  their suspended loads.” Most riggers identify hardware as  the snaps, adapters, rings, links, and releases commonly  used on harnesses. In addition to these components, other  hardware includes items such as lightweight links and snaps,  ripcords and handles, stiffeners, grommets, springs, and snap  fasteners.  [Figures 3-44  through  3-79]  

![](images/ab3c916141debce6db71b6f838066312f361eca5d4a1f34e1b30480a0660221b.jpg)

Figure 3-40.  Cord, Spectra ®  

Most load bearing hardware consists of drop-forged alloy  steel, sheet alloy steel, or forged aluminum alloy. Lightweight  hardware may be stamped from the sheet alloy steel, or in rare  instances, cast. Ripcord pins are cold forged. The majority of  the load bearing hardware is forged carbon steel with either  cadmium or zinc plating.

Figure 3-42.  Cord, HMA.  

In recent years, there has been a movement to produce newer  design hardware of stainless steel. This removes the problem  of plating and the environmental problems associated with  it. However, stainless is harder on the forging dies and the  finishing processes take longer. Consequently, stainless  hardware is generally more expensive than carbon steel.

All specification hardware has the appropriate number  stamped or marked on it. The MS prefix is on those with the  MIL-SPEC certification. All with the newer PIA certification  have the mark with the PS (Parachute Standards) prefix.  [Figure 3-64]  Most of the current hardware has the mark  with the MS prefix. As current stocks deplete, the mark on  new production is with the PS prefix.

# Plastics and Synthetics  

The term “plastic” used here is a generic term for synthetic  materials. The use of these materials is primarily for  stiffeners in containers. They replace the metal stiffeners  used in military systems. High-density polyethylene (HDPE)  was the first material used followed by Lexan ® . Time has

proven that moly disulfide (MDS) filled nylon is superior  to the other materials and has become the most commonly  used stiffener material. Today, the use of Lexan ®  is  primarily in clear windows in pin protector flaps. Stiffeners  should have rounded edges to prevent wear points and to  minimize the ability of lines to half hitch around them.  [Figures 3-80  through  3-84]

# Fasteners

Figure 3-76.  Ring, harness, replaceable, 3-ring.  

Fasteners are various types of devices designed to hold parts  or components together or allow them to be held open or  closed. The most common designs are hook and loop fasteners  (Velcro ® ), snaps, grommets, and slide fasteners (zippers).  

![](images/fce1be70fe73c76da60ecf6ce66346a6507012900118630956f5d6787c96351a.jpg)

Figure 3-78.  Ring, harness, 5010-SS Ring.  

Of all these, Velcro ®  and grommets play a major part in  parachute manufacture. The use of Velcro ®  is primarily for  protector flap closure designs, while grommets are for use in  pack closing systems. Both fasteners are subject to extreme  wear and tear in their normal use. Consequently, routine  maintenance involves the repair and replacement of these  items.  [Figures 3-85  through  3-89]

# Housings  

Housings are spiral-wound flexible tubing. Almost all are  stainless steel. Their design is to route, house, and protect  the ripcord cable. They are anchored to the container at one  end and the ripcord pocket or mount at the other end. Most  ripcord housings are compressible only, but some military

Figure 3-82.  Snap, static line, old style.  

housings used with seat parachutes are expandable as well.  The reason that ripcord housings are compressible and non- expandable is to prevent premature loading of the cable and  pin as the rig is donned and the user moves around. One-pin  sport container systems generally use a   $.26"$   inside diameter  housing. Two-pin and most military containers use a   $.375"$  inside diameter housing. Ripcord housings are measured  under slight tension.  

![](images/f31cb54bbc9a72cf87d2aaa3489bf78b9b1df47192233403d2a6c6f71d10f808.jpg)

Figure 3-84.  Soft link.  

The 3-ring release system employs the smaller   $.20"$   or .  $18"$  housing for use with Lolon (yellow), or Teflon (orange or  red), coated release cables. These “cutaway” housings must  be expandable and non-compressible. The reason for this  is, in the case where the loop load is excessive, the non- compressible housing will resist the loop or “push” against  it allowing an effective “pull” of the cable from the loop.  

![](images/8c96d577b63da501438141cb57143b72daf41ff1c9a3472d533df47daa754b0a.jpg)

Figure 3-86.  Poylethylene, high density (HDPE).  

Thus the term “push-pull system.” A compressible housing  compresses until it reaches its limit of compression, which  could be as much as 20 percent of the total length. In a  two-cable scenario, such as the 3-ring, the differential could  be as much as to allow the short side to release without  releasing the long side. Cutaway housings should be  measured in a relaxed state and then compressed to ensure  that it remains within the manufacturer’s allowable tolerance.  [ Figures 3-90A  through  3-92C]

# Ripcords, Cables, and Swages  

The standard ripcord used today on most parachute systems  consists of a stainless steel handle,   $\%\"~7\times7$   corrosion  resistant steel cable, a stainless steel terminal ball, and one or  more stainless steel pins swaged onto the cable. The handles  come in various shapes and sizes in order to be compatible  with main lift web lengths and pocket sizes and particulars,  such as whether the ripcord grip is inboard or outboard. The  terminal ball may be of several configurations, such as a  

![](images/d6e4fee9035f47dc5fa255c911e7c16b593f82dfc33981031143a35b4a1f3283.jpg)

ball and shank design. The pins usually are one of two basic  designs: intermediate pin or terminal pin. The advantage of the  intermediate pin is that it can be visually inspected easily by the  rigger in the field. The end of the   $7\times7$   cable can actually be  seen where it is ground off at the bend in the shank of the pin.  Metal ripcord assemblies are used on reserve and emergency  parachute systems and military mains. Main ripcords may also  consist of plastic handles and nylon coated cable without pins.

On modern sport parachutes, the hand deploy pilot chute  replaced the conventional ripcord, by either throw- out or pull-out. These configurations use the curved or  straight locking pins attached to the pilot chute bridle.  [Figures 3-93  through  3-101]

# Miscellaneous  

The miscellaneous category includes remaining items that  do not fit in any of the other categories. They fall somewhat  under the category of hardware, but are not load-bearing  type hardware like legstrap friction adaptors or hip rings.  Most of the these items are made of stamped metal rather

than forged steel. The plastic-looking, nylon “SR-Type  Snaps” are used on gear bags, helmets, and as temporary  holds for things such as tandem passenger drogue release  handles.  [Figures 3-102  through  3-118]  

# Chapter Summary  

Material identification and understanding of its functional  application is one of the most important aspects of becoming  a parachute rigger. In order to properly inspect and recertify  equipment—which is the rigger’s primary task—one has  to be able to recognize when a material is worn beyond its

required strength or if the wrong material has been selected  to make a repair.  

New high-tech fabrics are continually being explored,  especially in the area of canopy connector lines and canopy  cloth. Great improvements have been made in the reduction of  permeability of canopy fabrics. Permeability is a measure of  the ease with which a fluid (air in this case) can move through  

![](images/0c8345df16c4362b163f42ade19bcc72e34268c80e206ef9705439a148fdfc17.jpg)

the fabric. Various forms of silicone and polyurethane  coatings are used to create what we call in the vernacular,  “Zero-P.” Generally, coated canopy cloth is referred to as 0  cfm (cubic foot per minute), and uncoated canopy cloth is  referred to as   $0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$  . When we speak of porosity, we are  referring to a measure of the tiny open spaces in the weave of  the fabric. As canopy fabric wears, it becomes more porous  and the permeability increases.

# Introduction  

Certificated parachute riggers represent a professional cadre  within the parachute community. According to Title 14 of  the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 65, section  65.129(f)(1), “No certificated parachute rigger may exercise  the privileges of his certificate and type rating unless he  understands the current manufacturer’s instructions for  the operation involved and has performed duties under his  certificate for at least 90 days within the preceding 12 months.”  

Manufacturers of main parachutes have packing techniques  that they have developed for their products. Most of them  follow established methods in common use. Experience  has shown that if the packing techniques required for a  specific main are too complex, the market may not receive  them favorably.  

Throughout the chapter, each component of the parachute is  discussed along with its function and how it applies to the  entire assembly. One component can have a significant effect  on the performance of another. For example, a pilot chute that  is too large may result in too fast of an opening; and a pilot  chute that is too small may not be able to overcome a bag lock.  

# Sport Parachute Main Packing  Techniques  

When we talk about “square” parachutes, what we really  mean is rectangular plan form, semi-elliptical, or elliptical  plan form.  [Figures 4-1  through  4-3]  Plan form refers to the  shape of the canopy from a “birds eye view.”

There are essentially two ways to pack a square parachute:  flat packing or proper ram-air orientation (PRO) packing.  When flat packing, the canopy is laid on its side so that you  are viewing it in profile. The canopy is S-folded stacking the  line groups on top of one another. Variations to this method  include rolling the nose from the leading edge to the A line,  toward the tail, or splitting the nose cells in half, rolling them  inward, and tucking them into the center cell. The tail is then  split and cocooned around the rest of the canopy.  

The most common method of packing “square” mains and  reserves, however, is PRO packing. Developed by John  Sherman in the early 1970s when “squares” were first being  introduced, the premise was to pack them the same way one  would pack a round parachute—that is, to separate the four  line groups and flake the perimeter of the parachute with  the nose facing forward and the tail of the canopy facing  rearward. If one were tall enough to raise the round parachute  off the floor, it could be PRO packed. The advantage of  PRO packing is that it results in a more even distribution  of forces during opening shock and on-heading openings.  Figures 4-4  through    $_{4-35}$   illustrate PRO packing. There  are several variations to this technique designed for special  purposes. Free fall cameramen may require a slower opening  to reduce the opening shock. Canopy Relative Work (CRW)  parachutists may want faster sub-terminal openings. The  rigger should be able to provide guidance to the parachutist  for the type of opening required.

# Deployment and Inflation Characteristics  

Main canopies have changed dramatically over the last  several years and, consequently, different opening problems  have emerged. Some canopies are inherently hard openers,  while others are inherently slow openers. Accuracy canopies,  with their thick airfoils and large overhanging topskins, fall  into the first category, while thinner airfoils, with flatter trim  and baffled leading edges, tend to fall into the latter.  

One of the most common problems encountered is that of  hard openings. Line strip or line dump is the leading cause of  hard openings. This occurs when inadequately-stowed lines  come off of the bag all at once instead of releasing one line  bight at a time in an orderly fashion, and subsequently the  canopy is allowed to inflate prior to line stretch resulting in  sometimes an explosive opening. Securing the lines so that it  takes approximately 12 pounds of force to release each bight  is accomplished with a proper stow band and balancing the  weight and mass of the lines by placing 50 percent of the  line weight and mass on the mid-section of the bag and 25  percent of the weight and mass on each side of the bag. This  alleviates the problem of line strip.  

There are other methods employed to reduce hard openings,  such as rolling the nose of the canopy to delay the initial  inflation process as the leading edge unfurls. This rolling  technique varies from a single roll to several rolls.  [Figure 4-36]  If this does not solve the opening problem,  riggers should contact the manufacturer for advice. Most  manufacturers are very cooperative and have considerable  expertise in working with their products.  

![](images/c91cc2a535523ad7850f19ffc7f6cdb42b9e824d135bc4590630d9c79ea3a24a.jpg)  
Figure 4-36.  Rolling the nose of the canopy.  

The manufacturer may recommend modifying the slider size  or deployment brake settings. Of these options, the easiest to  do is to change the brake setting. Reducing the brake setting  results in less pressure on the canopy during opening, thereby  reducing the opening force. The negative effect of reducing the  brake setting is an increase in opening surge. The new brake  setting must find the balance of these results that best fit the  user. If changing the brake setting does not work, then the  rigger may wish to increase the size of the slider to slow the  openings. This usually means replacing the slider with a larger  one. This has the effect of increasing the drag on the slider and  restricting the canopy inflation. Another effective method of  preventing hard openings is to install a 2-inch diameter rubber  band on the center B or C line attachment tab and stowing the  apex of the slider in a single wrap of that band.  [Figure 4-37] The jumpers’ airspeed also has a significant effect on opening  shock. Jumpers should make a conscious effort to slow down  before putting out their pilot chute, and then assume a slightly  head high attitude in preparation for opening.  

As canopies age and accumulate substantial jumps on them,  many begin to develop slow openings, commonly known  as “sniveling.” If the canopy was originally packed with  the nose rolled, reducing the number of rolls may speed up  the openings. However, many times the slow openings are  due to other causes. Probably the main reason for canopies  developing slow openings is increased porosity that occurs  with frequent use. It is especially noticeable on canopies that  have a “lip” or a baffled nose. These particular design features  cause a canopy to open slower for softer openings, which  

![](images/4d2a4aefe1b6814850a8b3bf3009279fab23392cc6879297c00c4ec962891cf3.jpg)  
Figure 4-37.  Rubber band on center C-Line attachment tab holding  apex of slider.  

is a desirable characteristic, but as the canopy fabric wears  and permeability increases, the openings may get too slow.  

The effect on fabric that originally had a permeability of 0–3  cubic feet per minute (CFM) or 0–5 CFM, such as PIA-C-  44378, may not be as dramatic. With these canopies, pulling  down the tail by deepening the brake setting speeds up the  inflation of the canopy. The rigger must be careful not to set  the brakes so deeply as to place the canopy in a stall during  opening. If this does not work, then decreasing the size of  the slider or the fabric type of the slider may help speed up  the openings. The size and condition of the pilot chute may  also contribute to the perceived speed of opening.  

Another cause is when the canopy gets out of trim due to  the stretch of the suspension lines or shrinkage of steering/ brake lines. The rigger should check the trim of the canopy  against the manufacturer’s specifications and either re-trim  the canopy or re-line it. This may have a pronounced effect of  improving the openings, as well as the flying characteristics.  

# Main Pilot Chute  

Hand deploy pilot chutes are made from either the  PIA-C-44378 (0–3 CFM) (formerly known as F-111 which  is a proprietary brand name that is no longer manufactured.  

Currently 0-3 CFM is commonly referred to as Silktique and  Exazta-Chute) fabric or zero porosity (0 CFM) fabric. The  PIA-C-44378 fabric begins as a very low-porosity fabric but,  as it is used, the permeability increases. When this happens,  the drag of the pilot chute decreases. Consequently, the ability  of the pilot chute to “lift” the weight of the canopy decreases  and the speed of the opening is affected. Experience has  shown that pilot chutes made from this type of fabric exhibit  a decrease in performance at around 500 jumps under normal  use. Pilot chutes made from the ZP fabric last considerably  longer than those made from 0–3 CFM fabric. However, there  has been some disagreement concerning the use of the two  different fabrics in pilot chutes. One canopy manufacturer  advocates the use of F-111-type fabric only. They believe  the ZP fabric contributes to hard openings. Most parachutists  like ZP pilot chutes because they last longer. The size of the  pilot chute has a direct correlation to the type of opening  experienced. In the early days of hand deploy chutes, a 36- inch 0–3 CFM pilot chute was standard on most systems.  As the canopies became smaller and lighter, pilot chutes  became smaller as well. Today, 24-, 26-, 28-, and 30-inch  pilot chutes are all common.  

Several factors dictate the size of the pilot chute used. The  first is the weight of the canopy. Another factor is the main  container closing configuration. Some systems are designed  to hold the deployment bag so securely that it requires more  drag to extract it from the container. This type may require  a larger pilot chute than the type of container that allows  unrestricted extraction of the bag. This same problem can  develop when an individual packs an oversized main canopy  into the main container. If a larger deployment bag is used  to hold the additional volume and the bag is forcibly stuffed  into the container, the bag can be restricted from being pulled  smoothly from the container. If the pilot chute is too small, a  pilot chute in tow can result. If the parachutist puts a larger  pilot chute on the system, the bag can be extracted from the  container, but the increased size of the pilot chute contributes  to increased snatch force during the opening sequence. This  results in perceived hard openings.  

It should be noted that deployment bags are matched  dimensionally to containers—not to canopies. If the tray of  your container is 12 inches wide, 7 inches long, and 5 inches  thick, the bag should also be those dimensions. Forcing a  larger bag into the container overstresses the flaps, grommets,  stiffeners, and some loop anchors. Conversely, if you put  a smaller canopy than was originally intended into the  container, you should use the same bag and pack the canopy  as wide and “fluffy” as possible. In other words, do not squish  all of the air out of the pack job as you normally would. The  main closing loop should be appropriately shortened.  

Using a smaller bag than the container was built for can result  in unsafe conditions as well. In the event of a premature  container opening, the bag may float out before the jumper  has an opportunity to deploy the pilot chute. Some friction  is desirable so that the bag rotates out of the container in  the proper sequence—bridle up, lines down. There is an  exception to this tenet for wingsuiters, who essentially open  in a track. So, the size of the pilot chute and, to some extent,  the deployment bag can have considerable effect on the  opening of the main parachute.  

# Bridle Length  

The length of the bridle has an effect primarily on the  deployment of the main pilot chute itself. In the case of a  throw-out pilot chute, the bridle must be long enough to get  the deployed pilot chute out of the turbulence in the wake of  the jumper’s back. If the bridle is too short, the pilot chute  stays in the parachutist’s burble. The length of the bridle  from the locking pin to the pilot chute averages around 7 feet.  

Recent years have seen the growth of the use of the “birdman”  flying suits or wingsuits. Because of the increased surface  area and the decreased free fall speeds, the use of a longer  bridle has become common, with a 9-foot length working  well. Along with the longer bridle, containers have been  modified to allow the bottom to open fully and the main bag  to be extracted rearward towards the feet due to the more  horizontal trajectory of the parachutist. Some manufacturers  have also reoriented the mouth of the main deployment bag  for wingsuiters so that the lines are sitting on the floor of the  container tray rather than the bottom flap. This way the bag  rotates  $90^{\circ}$   out of the container rather than   $180^{\circ}$  .  

In the case of a pull-out pilot chute, where the jumper actually  pulls the pin, the pilot chute is placed with an arc motion of  the arm in the fast air near his or her head so as to avoid the  burble. The jumper’s grip on the pull-out handle is gradually  released as they rotate into a head-high position, reducing the  size of the burble, and in preparation for opening.  

# Rubber Bands  

The rubber stow bands play an important part in the  deployment sequence and serve two important functions.  First, they hold the mouth of the deployment bag closed  and prevent premature deployment of the main canopy.  Secondly, they hold the line stows securely to allow a clean,  orderly deployment of the lines. With the advent of smaller  diameter lines, such as 550 or 725 Spectra ®  and   $\mathrm{HMA^{\mathcal{B}}}$  ,  smaller diameter rubber bands have been developed to  properly secure these lines. If the smaller rubber bands are  not available, many parachutists double stow the larger rubber  bands around the small lines.  

There are other products, which are designed to replace rubber  bands and last longer, but they have downsides. Rubber bands  other than military standard (Mil Spec) rubber bands may not  break at the desired 40–45 pounds and can lead to bag locks.  Other products may not have enough retention ability and  allow the lines to “dump.”  Figure 4-38  shows the various  rubber bands and Tube Stoes ® . In addition to the correct rubber  bands, the length of the line stows is important as well. In the  past, 1-inch stows were common, but today 3-inch stows are  recommended by several manufacturers.  Figure 4-39  shows  the comparison between the two lengths. The main point to  remember is that the lines must be stowed neatly and securely.

# Assembly of the Main Canopy To The  Harness and Container  

The rigger should be familiar with the various types of  canopy releases currently in use. In skydiving, the most  common release is the 3-ring release system. It was originally  developed in 1976 for skydiving, but has since become  the dominant release system for intentional jumping, both  civilian and military.  

Riggers must be familiar with the assembly of the 3-ring  release since they may have to connect new canopies to the  harness and container or have to disconnect the main canopy to  untangle it after landing. Shown in  Figures 4-40  through  4-47 is the correct assembly sequence. The rigger must also be  able to inspect the 3-ring release to determine any wear. In  particular, the following areas need to be inspected:

# Assembly of Components and  Compatibility  

Advisory Circular (AC) 105-2D, Sport Parachuting states that  “the assembly or mating of approved parachute components  from different manufacturers may be made by a certificated,  appropriately rated parachute rigger in accordance with the  parachute manufacturer's instructions and without further  authorization by the manufacturer's or the FAA.” This allows  the rigger to assemble different canopies to different harness  and container systems. This is an important authorization for  any rigger in that there are dozens of possible combinations.  

When various parachute components are interchanged, the  parachute rigger should follow the canopy manufacturer’s  instructions, as well as the parachute container manufacturer’s  instructions. However, the container manufacturer’s  instructions take precedence when there is a conflict between  the two. The logic behind this is that the container is the  active component and the canopy is the passive component  with regard to deployment. Determining compatibility is  more than simply determining the volume compatibility of  a canopy to a container size. Other factors, that need to be  considered are the deployment type, technical standard order  (TSO) certification, and placard limitations.  

# Reserve Bag Extraction Force  

When we ask the question, “How do you determine  compatibility between approved parachute components,”  the answer is, “Rig functionality must not be compromised.”  Some say if a reserve canopy is too bulky, the reserve  deployment bag is not easily extracted. If you can get the  bagged canopy in the container, it should take no more than  18 pounds of pull force to extract it.  

# TSO Certification and Placard Limitations  

This area is one where many riggers have some confusion.  According to AC 105-2, Sport Parachute Jumping, “the  strength of the harness must always be equal to or greater  than the maximum force generated by the canopy during  certification tests.” In the case where the harness is  certificated under TSO-C23b and the canopy under TSO- C23c, the maximum generated force of the canopy must  not exceed the certificated category force of the harness  and container (i.e., Low Speed Category (3,000 pounds)  and Standard Category (5,000 pounds)). In this instance, no  additional marking on the container is necessary.  

In the case where the canopy is certificated under TSO-C23b  and the harness under TSO-C23c, the strength of the harness  must be equal to or greater than the certificated category  force of the canopy.  

For the current TSO-C23d, the peak force measured during  the strength drops must be placarded on the outside of the  harness. In this case, the strength of the canopy must not  exceed that of the harness.  

The rigger, when making the determination as to whether a  particular canopy and rig combination is compatible, must  consider all of the above areas. If there is any doubt, the rigger  should contact the rig manufacturer for guidance.  

# Harness Strength  

TSO-C23b was originally written back in the 1940s before  the advent of square parachutes. It had two categories under  which a parachute system could be certified. The “Low  Speed” category was limited to use in aircraft under 150 miles  per hour (MPH) and certified to 3,000 pounds. This category  required large block letters decrying “limited to use in aircraft  under 150 MPH.” It also had a “Standard Category.” This  category required no warning labels and had neither weight  nor speed limitations and was tested and certified to 5,000  pounds. It is important to note that neither category had a  weight limitation.  

Weight has only a minimum effect on parachute opening  forces. To be exact, if you were to increase a given weight  by 50 percent, you would only see a 5 percent increase in  opening force; likewise if you double that given weight, you  would only see a 10 percent increase in opening force.  

This seems counter intuitive until you think about it. Speed  is the critical factor that hurts us and our equipment when we  have the occasional hard opening. But because speed is often  derived from mass or weight, we associate the hard opening  with primarily weight. Let us look at the calculations.  

The math model for opening forces is described in the  “Recovery Systems Design Guide” by Theodore Knacke.  The definitions and formula is as follows:  

•	 Force—total opening forces  •	  $\mathrm{C_{d}}$  —drag coefficient of canopy  •	  $S_{\mathrm{o}}$  —square footage of canopy  •	 Q—dynamic pressure in pounds per/square foot  	  $(\mathbb{V}_{2}\,\mathsf{p v}^{2})$  )  •	  $X_{1}$  —decreasing load factor 	 NOTE: There are 2 methods for deriving this factor.  The Pflanze method and a lookup of the chart included  in the reference manual. The chart is the simplest for  personnel parachutes and effectively results in being  one tenth of the pound per square foot loading.  •	  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}=$  shock load coefficient which is derived from  testing and includes such things as slider size, brake  setting, angle of nose cut, etc. For this exercise we  will use a value of 1 as this number ranges from .5 to  1.5 or so. Without a slider it can go as high as 10.  

Therefore: Force  $\mathrm{\Gamma=C_{d}\times S_{o}\times Q\times X_{1}\times C_{x}}$  

If we group the  $\mathrm{C_{d}}\times\mathrm{S_{o}}\times\mathrm{Q}$   and calculate them, at first we  get a big number ie:  

$\ensuremath{\mathrm{~C_{d}~}}=.8\,\mathrm{~S_{o}}=200$   square feet   $\mathrm{Q}=33$   PSF   $@$   117MPH  together  $=$     $.8\times200\times33=5{,}280$   pounds. This number is  then ameliorated by the  $X_{1}$    decreasing load factor and the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}$  shock load factor. If the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}$   is 1 (and we will assume this for  this example), then it has no effect on the outcome.  

The   $X_{1}$   factor is the key because it is based on pounds per  square foot loading multiplied by 1. If you try different  weight values and reiterate the formula, you can see it only  changes the  $X_{1}$   factor by fractional amounts and only affects  the outcome minimally as described earlier.  

National Aerospace Standards (NAS) 804 has the best  requirements for structural integrity of any standard written  to date. This is because it has a strength requirement: 3,000  pounds for the Low Speed Category and 5,000 pounds for  the Standard Category. Other standards (AS8015) use a  performance requirement (weight versus speed) for structural  integrity verification. This would be acceptable except for one  small problem. AC 105-2, Sport Parachute Jumping, allows  for mixing and matching of approved components. This is  a problem because different canopies open with different  opening characteristics at the same weights and speeds. This  is defined and accounted for by the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}$   value. Therefore, if a  harness is built and tested using a canopy with a low  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}$   and  matched with a canopy (under the provisions of AC 105-2)  with a high  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{x}}$  , the results could be disastrous.  

NAS 804 systems need no further consideration other than  originally called for. The Low Speed designation is limited to  use in aircraft under   $150\,\mathrm{MPH}$   at any weight. Likewise, the  Standard Category of 5,000 pounds has no weight or speed  limitations. This is an unlimited category. One reason for this  is because of the limited effect of weight on opening forces.  Speed is what kills. If a human body were to reach a 5,000  pound shock load, it would come apart before the harness  or canopy. At less than   $150\;\mathrm{MPH}$  , even at a high weight, it  will not exceed 3,000 pounds.  

It may be evident now that there is a flaw in our structural  requirements due to the mixing and matching of approved  components under the performance standard versus a  structural standard. This came about as a result of the change  from a Structural Standard (NAS-804) to a Performance  Standard (AS 8015b). Now we have no way to determine  compatibility for TSO-C23c (AS8015b).  

It may not be possible to have compatibility using  performance standards alone. That is why we added placards  for the “weight tested to” for harnesses and the “force  generated” for canopies to TSO-C23d. There is no way  to determine compatibility from one parachute system to  another within the same category of the same standard if  they are judged using a performance standard. Just because  they were tested at the same weight and speed does not mean  they saw the same opening forces. Different canopies open  with different characteristics. Listed below is a hypothetical  comparison of the opening characteristics of two different  systems tested to the same performance standard. The math  is the same as previously discussed. The two canopies have  very different opening characteristics, and they produce very  different results when tested at the same levels. When a mix  of the two systems is applied and subjected to a high-stress  sport jump, the capability of the harness may be exceeded.  

Both systems were tested using a 300-pound test dummy at  180 knots (207 MPH) Cat “B” TSO-C23c.  

System 1: 200 square foot canopy  $\mathrm{W}/.8\,\mathrm{C_{d}}$   produces a 1,304  pounds force on opening at test speeds.  

System 2: 100 square foot canopy  $\mathrm{W}/.9\,\mathrm{C_{d}}$   produces a 3,668  pounds force on opening at test speeds.  

The ratio of opening force differential is 2.8 to one or System  2 opens with 2.8 times greater force than System 1.  

Let’s say a harness is built for System 1 using 1,500 pounds  capable hardware. It passes the structural drops, as it only  sees 1,304 pounds.  

Another harness is built for System 2 that has a canopy with  desirable flight characteristics but that tends to open hard.  

The jumper wants the canopy with desirable flight  characteristics in his new System 1 rig. If compatibility  is derived from performance standards, then these are  compatible since they were both tested using a 300-pound  drop test dummy at 180 knots. It is entirely possible that a  sport opening under extreme conditions could produce an  opening of 1,600 pounds, which exceeds the capability of  the 1,500 pound hardware.  [Figure 4-53]  

![Figure 4-53.  Canopy characteristics. ](images/cc117d966edf45a3c5d775a8c9b0e9e57449081cd9a3d86459d3238d00668736.jpg)  

TSO-C23b does not really have any limitations except for  speeds below 150 for “Low Speed” category with no weight  limit. That standard is good for all skydiving scenarios. The  3,000 pounds test load is strong enough for anything and  force is a good base line for compatibility.  

The current regulation for placarding (AS8015c/TSO C-23d)  calls for “Average Peak Force.” Under AS8015b/TSO-C23c  (the previous version), there is no way for a rigger to make the  necessary determinations without help from the manufacturer  doing some kind of retro placcarding as the requirement did  not include force measurement. Fortunately, there are only  a small number of systems/components certified under this  rendition. Any component so certified would not be able to  be used as there are no guidelines for compatibility.  

# Volume  

An important criterion in determining compatibility is  the volume of the canopy. The canopy has to fit into the  container in such a manner as to not place undue stress on  the system when packing and to be extracted by the pilot  chute during deployment. The container manufacturer  usually provides a volume chart of their systems stating  what the volumes are for the various model sizes. Container  volumes are somewhat nonsequitur; however, as container  manufacturers derive their numbers in different ways. Some  container manufacturers do not publish numbers per se;  rather, they indicate a model designation that fits a size  range of canopies.  

The canopy manufacturer should provide the volumes of  the canopy models. Measuring canopy volumes has proven  to be an imprecise science as there are various methods that  can be used. The most common method involves placing  the canopy in a tubular chamber and compressing it with  a standard amount of weight for a set time. The displaced  volume is then measured.  Figure 4-54  shows one such  volume chamber. Slight differences in volume can be seen  from chamber to chamber and canopy to canopy. These  variances occur due to humidity at the time the test is  conducted and due to variation in the bulk of the fabric that  the canopy was built with. For example, sometimes a 150  square foot reserve is 312 cubic inch and sometimes that  very same model, built using a different dye lot of fabric is  363 cubic inch. Canopy volume charts can be found on the  Parachute Industry Association (PIA) website at www.pia. com and the Parachute Labs website at www.jumpshack. com. While some canopy manufacturers disagree with  the resultant numbers, most container manufacturers and  riggers agree that these independent test methods are useful  in determining volume compatibility.  

# Deployment Type  

In Chapter 2 of this handbook, Design and Construction,  the different types of canopy deployment devices were  described. In some instances, the container system needs  to be of a specific configuration to accommodate a certain  deployment device. An example of this would be where a  round canopy utilizing a Type 1 configuration is packed into  a pilot emergency parachute system. In this case, the pilot  chute is compressed directly onto the floor of the container  system.  [Figure 4-55]  This same canopy can be packed into  

![](images/02c010ec264dba532f22e0d2551e83bef2789fd644e18b9ff7f9a9ae83072f12.jpg)

a sport reserve container, but the sport rig has two internal  or staging flaps that compress and hold the canopy in place  and are locked together by the bridle.  [Figure 4-56]  The pilot  chute is then packed on top of the internal flaps. The rigger  needs to know and understand these differences to determine  how the two components interface for compatibility.

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter focuses on main parachute packing techniques.  The first rule is that the lines must be straight (no tangles,  also known as “step throughs”). If the lines are straight and  the slider is up (in square parachutes), the parachute will  most likely open. The speed of the opening directly impacts  the comfort or discomfort perceived by the jumper. Opening  speed and orderliness is controlled by attenuation devices  such as the slider, deployment bag, stow bands, or the diaper  on a round parachute. Accoutrements, such as pilot chutes  and bridles, must be checked frequently for wear that could  affect their performance.  

Rubber bands should be changed when they begin to exhibit  small holes or ragged edges. Minor maintenance now  prevents hard openings and major failures later. Learn to be  observant of small details about the parachute system even  when packing the main. Virtually every pack job should  be an inspection. It does not have to be as thorough an  inspection as you would perform at the 180-day inspection  and recertification, but the packer should be vigilant for  damage or things that do not look quite right.  

Compatibility can be complex. When in doubt about  which TSO a component was certified in, and whether it is  compatible with another component in terms of opening force  generated by the canopy versus strength of the harness, do  not hesitate to call the manufacturer for guidance.  

One of the most critical things the rigger must observe when  servicing their customers rigs is reserve bag extraction force.  When a customer brings his or her container for inspection and  repack, reserve bag extraction force should be tested with the  container closed. A good rule of thumb is that the extraction  force should be the same as the weight of the bagged canopy.  If excessive forces are encountered, call the manufacturer.  

# Chapter 5 Inspection and Packing  

# Introduction  

There are a dozen or more commonly seen harness container  systems being actively used in the field today. The differences  between them can be subtle or, in some cases, polar opposite.  Most packing manuals can be found on-line or can be  purchased from the container manufacturer. Canopy folding  methods are fairly universal from rig to rig. It is the closing of  the container that is proprietary. The single-pin rig shown in  the following illustrations is somewhat representative of other  single-pin reserves. Reserve Static Line (RSL) and Main  Activated Reserve Deployment (MARD) configurations  differ from rig to rig, and so individual manuals should be  consulted for exact routing and setup. Rigs that use a pop-top  or externally-mounted reserve pilot chute differ significantly  from the single-pin rigs. There are sport and pilot emergency  rigs that utilize this design.  

For most people, parachute rigging is all about packing  parachutes. Rigging and packing may be synonymous, but  there is a distinct difference. In its truest form, parachute  rigging is the practice of assembling a parachute system with  its various components into an operative assembly. Packing is  the practice of folding the parachute canopy in an organized  manner such that it fits into the container system and allows  the canopy to open when the user activates the system.  

There are five distinct stages involved in packing the  parachute. They are:  

1.	 Identification 2.	 Inspection 3.	 Rigging and/or repairs 4.	 Packing 5.	 Documentation  

# Identification  

The first thing the rigger should do when a customer brings  a parachute in for packing or repair is to confirm that the  owner’s information is correct on the packing data card.  This ensures that the rigger’s logbook entry is accurate. In a  commercial loft, a work order is filled out with all the correct  information about the customer and the parachute. Many lofts  that do a high volume of business input this information into  a computer database for tracking their customers. This data  is then used to send automatic repack notices to customers.  This ensures that the reserve or emergency parachute is legal  to use when the customer needs it.  

# Inspection  

The owner should bring the parachute to the rigger in its  packed condition. This practice should be encouraged for  several reasons. The canopy is a fragile item and is subject  to damage or contamination if left exposed to the elements,  and the container is designed to protect the canopy from  damage. The parachute should be opened only in the  controlled environment of the parachute loft. This is so  the entire system can be examined externally for signs of  damage or contamination before it is opened. Next, the owner  should don the parachute and pull the ripcord as in a real life  scenario to understand how to activate the system properly  and experience what it feels like to actually pull the reserve  ripcord. This gives the owner a great degree of confidence  that the parachute will work when needed. It is something  that jumpers rarely get to do, and their reaction is generally  one of curiosity and satisfaction. Doing so also lets the owner  see what is in there. It is surprising how many jumpers do not  even know what color their reserve parachute is.  

Generally, customers leave the parachute to be repacked;  however, riggers should invite their customers to stay and  observe the repack. Many riggers encourage this behavior  since it results in a more educated individual. In a busy loft  environment, however, a scheduled appointment might be  needed to allow for the increased time necessary to explain  the process. If the customer decides to watch the inspection  and repack, the rigger should allow at least twice the usual  time for the project so the customer can ask questions.  Another benefit of this is that the customer gets to see the  effort it takes to service a parachute.  Figure 5-1  shows  a packing flow chart that details the sequence of events  the rigger should follow from receiving the parachute to  collecting the money from the customer.  

Upon completion of the visual inspection, there are two  options for continuing. If there are no visual indications of  damage or contamination, move on to the next step of opening  the parachute. If something suspicious is found, or if there  is a hole in the container or discoloration to the container  fabric, the rigger needs to see if the damage penetrated into  the canopy. To do so, note the location and check internally  after opening the parachute.  

If the owner is participating in the inspection, it is a good  idea to have them backed against the packing table or similar  surface when they pull the ripcord so the canopy does not fall  out on the floor. This keeps the canopy clean, but it also lets the  rigger control the extraction of the canopy from the container.  It is good practice to hold the canopy in the container while  the owner takes off the pack. In the case of a bagged square  reserve, the bag extraction force should be measured to ensure  that it is not excessive. Place the rig on the table or clean floor  and measure using a fish scale or by simply lifting the bag  by its bridle. Bag extraction forces vary between brands of  containers. The manufacturer of the given container should be  able to provide a maximum acceptable extraction force in terms  of pounds. The rigger can then proceed to thoroughly examine  the previous pack job and to check those areas previously  identified as damaged or contaminated.  

During the examination of the parachute for damage or  contamination, the rigger should also look at how the  previous rigger packed the canopy. Particularly in regard  to pilot emergency parachutes, riggers sometimes exercise  great latitude in interpreting the packing instructions in order  to make the parachute as comfortable as possible for the  pilot. Each rigger makes the determination as to what is the  correct packing method. If the present rigger finds that the  last pack job was in error, the individual responsible needs  to be notified of the findings.  

![](images/5442408f3688f7cce49b0b16c9842684fedfc8843e01805b98c0060889e16395.jpg)  
Figure 5-1.  Packing flow chart.  

The rigger should then verify the make, model, and serial  number of the parachute. Sometimes the canopy may have  been changed in an assembly, particularly in a sport rig.  For sport rigs and some emergency rigs, be sure to check  the Automatic Activation Device (AAD). The newest data  cards provide space for information on the AAD to include  service cycle and date of last battery replacement. With the  recent widespread acceptance of AADs, this is one area the  rigger cannot overlook.  

The battery life cycle, the unit service life cycle, and how  they interface with the inspection and repack cycle of the  parachute are very important things to consider. The major  question the rigger must ask is: If the battery or unit service  life expires during the upcoming inspection cycle, should the  rigger pack the parachute and seal it, thereby certifying it for  the next 180-day inspection cycle? A comparable situation  would be if an airframe and powerplant mechanic signs off an  annual inspection on an aircraft. The mechanic is saying that  the aircraft is airworthy at that time. However, the mechanic  is not responsible for the future status of the aircraft if the  emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is due for battery service  during the next year that the annual is valid; that responsibility  lies with the aircraft owner. This scenario can be reasonably  extended to the AAD and parachute. Generally, however,  most riggers refuse to pack the parachute if the battery or  unit life cycle expires during the 180-day inspection cycle.  

Some AAD manufacturers have specific rules regarding  battery and repack expiration dates. For example, the  manufacturer might mandate that if the battery life expires  during the 180-day inspection cycle, then the rigger is not  to pack it unless the batteries are replaced or the unit is  removed from the assembly. Regarding the 4-year service  cycle required for some AADs, there is a 90-day grace period  for servicing. If the 180-day inspection cycle expires within  that 90-day period, then the rigger may inspect, repack, and  recertify the assembly. If the inspection cycle extends past the  90-day period, then the rigger should not pack the assembly  with the AAD. In any case, the rigger should follow the  directions of the AAD manufacturer for that particular make  and model of AAD.  

The rigger must make sure to have the latest revision of  the packing instructions, as well as any pertinent service  bulletins from the manufacturer or Airworthiness Directives 

 (AD) issued by the Federal Aviation Administration 

 (FAA). The rigger may have a set of packing instructions  that specifies a certain method for folding the canopy.  However, the manufacturer may have changed the method  and issued a revision to the manual or a complete new one.  If the rigger is not completely sure that he or she has the  latest information, then it is time to use the most valuable  tool in their inventory—the telephone. A quick call to the  manufacturer is all it takes to get the latest information. Most  manufacturers publish their service bulletins in hard copy  format and on their website.  

In addition, the Parachute Industry Association (PIA) also  has a listing of service bulletins at www.pia.com. It is  most important that all riggers make an effort to maintain  a comprehensive library of packing instructions and their  associated service bulletins. Under Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 65, section 65.129(e),  the certificated rigger may not “pack, maintain, or alter  a parachute in any manner that deviates from procedures  approved by the Administrator or the manufacturer of the  parachute.” In addition, 14 CFR part 65, section 65.129(f),  also states that the certificated rigger may not “exercise  the privileges of his certificate and type rating unless he  understands the current manufacturer’s instructions for the  operation involved.”  

# Component Compatibility  

Once the rigger has all of the current manuals and  information, the inspection can continue. This covers not just  the canopy but also the entire assembly. In addition to looking  for damage or contamination to the system, the rigger must  make sure that all of the component parts are compatible and  approved by the manufacturer.  Figure 5-2  shows a sample  parts list for a typical sport parachute, having dual parachutes  in a single-harness system (a piggyback). This parts list  delineates exactly what parts are used in the assembly of the  system. The rigger should check each component part and its  identifying label or stamp against the parts list. Mismatched  component parts are among the most frequent problems  found in the field. Many riggers are under the impression  they can freely interchange component parts, but this may be  done only within certain limits. Paragraph 11(a) of Advisory  Circular (AC) 105-2, Sport Parachute Jumping, states: “The  assembly or mating of approved parachute components from  different manufacturers may be made by a certificated and  appropriately-rated parachute rigger or parachute loft in  accordance with the parachute manufacturer’s instructions  and without further authorization by the manufacturer or  the FAA. Specifically, when various parachute components  are interchanged, the parachute rigger should follow the  canopy manufacturer’s instructions, as well as the parachute  container manufacturer’s instructions. However, the  container manufacturer’s instructions take precedence when  there is a conflict between the two.” In  Figure 5-2 , note the  bold print at the bottom of the page: “NO SUBSTITUTION  OF COMPONENT PARTS IS AUTHORIZED!” This  manufacturer specifically states that you cannot use anything  other than Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts.  Substituting other parts places the rigger in violation of the  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  

![Figure 5-2.  Sample parts list. ](images/f521656f9e04d3e9180cb1aff3938759b5c140d8f3a0d38009dccb5301cdc3fc.jpg)  

A common problem found in the field concerns reserve  ripcords. Several manufacturers of sport rigs use a one-pin  ripcord with a mini trapezoidal handle and a cable length  27–29 inches long. Depending on the actual container it  goes into, it is possible to use one manufacturer’s ripcord in  another container as long as the rigger feels there is sufficient  excess cable for safety reasons.  

However, imagine one ripcord is 27 inches overall and is  used in a system that is approved under Technical Standard  Order (TSO) C-23b and is rated at 300 pounds. Another  ripcord is 28 inches overall and is used in a system approved  under TSO C-23c and is rated at 600 pounds for use with a  Reserve Static Line (RSL) installation. The problem here is  the mating of different TSO standard components. Installing  the first ripcord in the second container with an RSL lanyard  may be degrading the safety aspect of the system. So how  does the rigger tell which is which? The ripcord approved  under TSO C-23b has minimal markings, perhaps only a  manufacturer’s part number. The ripcord approved under  TSO C-23c has several markings on the handle as required  by the TSO. It should have the manufacturer’s part number,  manufacturer’s identification, TSO-C23c, and the batch or  serial number or date of manufacture.  [Figure 5-3]  In reality,  as long as the cable lengths are compatible, the function of  the ripcord will probably work. The problem surfaces in the  event of a problem or incident involving the system. At this  point, the FAA could find the mismatched component and  take action against the rigger who packed the parachute.

Figure 5-3.  Reserve ripcord with TSO markings.  

A bigger problem surfaces when the rigger substitutes a  reserve deployment bag made by another manufacturer. Most  reserve deployment bags are compatible with the appropriate  container based on dimensions and volume. If the deployment  bag does not fit correctly, there can be a problem with proper  functioning of the system. These are two examples of the  more common compatibility issues that are regularly found  in the field. There are others that the rigger may encounter  and need to address as well. The best solution is for the rigger  to follow the manufacturer’s parts list strictly to ensure the  safety of the parachute system.  

After the rigger has determined that all of the component  parts are compatible, he or she can now commence the actual  inspection of the parachute assembly.  Figure 5-4  shows a  typical pilot emergency parachute assembly with a round  canopy laid out on the packing table. Make sure the canopy is  straight and the apex lines are even. Then apply firm tension  to the canopy and lines using a tension board. The standard  is to start at the top of the assembly.  

The assembly shown in  Figure 5-4  can be broken down into  the following six separate areas:  

1.	 Pilot chute and bridle 2.	 Canopy and deployment device 3.	 Suspension lines and connector links 4.	 Container 5.	 Harness including risers 6.	 Ripcord  

![](images/d679dce8d0860150e49afcf0cf191ac9df7b29a76f3bf15ce971032432c6d9e6.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.  Round canopy pilot emergency parachute assembly.  

Inspection/packing checklists allow riggers to track their  progress as they do their inspection.  [Figure 5-5]  It is desirable  for riggers to complete their inspection uninterrupted, which  ensures that the inspection process is followed and nothing  gets overlooked. This rarely happens, however, due to  normal interruptions, such as phone calls or customer  

![](images/7026698d6c3a4a6e158b7af06e8ed63ff070203e37f7341a605f37e8facb1a6c.jpg)

questions. Using the inspection checklist ensures that after  an interruption, the rigger is able to continue at the proper  spot without missing anything. This checklist is divided into  seven sections that make it usable for all types of parachute  assemblies. It includes an area for counting the tools at the  beginning and end of the inspection and packing procedure.  This ensures that no tools are overlooked or left in the  parachute. While this may sound implausible to some, it has  happened over the years, sometimes with fatal consequences.  

# Round Canopies and Pilot Emergency Systems  

The first thing the rigger should check is the continuity of  the canopy to make sure it is straight. Do so by laying the  system on the table as if the wearer were laying face down,  head toward the canopy. (On some models, such as military  seat parachutes, it may be face down with the feet towards the  canopy.) Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.  Ensure that the canopy is right side out (i.e., the data panel  faces out) and the gore numbers are readable on the outside.  Attach the required tension devices and apply light tension.  Standing at the canopy, split the riser line groups and grasp  the two gores that separate them. The top panel should have  line number 1 and the last line of the sequence depending  on the number of lines on the canopy. Starting with number  1, the lines will run in sequence counterclockwise around  the canopy.  [Figure 5-6]  The four lines attached to these  two gores comprise the standard “four-line check” for a  round canopy. By running these four lines from the canopy  to the connector links, the rigger can make a quick check  of straightness. If the rigger was the last person to pack the  parachute, he or she may feel this is sufficient to ensure  continuity. However, most riggers do a full check of all the  lines, even on their own pack jobs.  

# Straightening the Canopy  

If a rigger finds lines out of sequence or the canopy is inside  out, it becomes necessary to remove any twists, tangles, or  turns. There are two things to remember when encountering  this situation. First, if the parachute was originally straight  and the entanglement occurred from handling, it is possible  to untangle the parachute without disconnecting anything.  Second, if the parachute was assembled incorrectly in the  first place, it is virtually impossible to straighten it without  disassembling it. These two scenarios become particularly  acute when the rigger is brought a parachute for repacking  and it was assembled incorrectly. At first, the rigger assumes  it to be correct, but when a correct continuity cannot be done,  it becomes very frustrating, and the rigger may spend an  excessive amount of time trying to straighten the canopy.  

The rigger should always start at the top or apex end of the  canopy. Make sure that the top gore with the data panel is  facing up. Follow the gore to the apex so that the upper lateral  band is on the outside. Attach the apex to the upper tension  

![](images/dd3eea4ec1f4dccf191c2691b80c0a1e31cc9fcb4d0cba9cc8ed9fedbba8013c.jpg)

device. Next, flake the gores in sequence to see if the canopy  is straight. Split the canopy so the left and right line groups  are separate at the skirt of the canopy.  [Figure 5-7]  Pick up  the two center gores and grasp the four lines.  [Figure 5-8]   These are line number 1 and the last line of the sequence.  Run these lines down toward the risers and/or container. On  most canopies, these lines run to the inside, top connector link  of a four-link system or to the inside of a two-link system.  [Figure 5-9]  If these lines are correct, continue the checking  of the line continuity. If the lines are not straight, release the  risers from the harness, if possible. If not, take one of the  two top lines and untangle it until the line runs straight back  to the canopy without going around any of the other lines.  Untangle the risers and harness/container until the rest of the  lines are straight. Repeat with the other riser, if applicable.  Attach the rest of the connector links to the tension device  and do a thorough continuity check from the canopy to the  connector links. If the lines were incorrectly assembled,  disconnect the link from the riser, remove the lines, and  reinstall them onto the connector link in the correct order.  Reinstall the connector link to the riser. Check the entire  canopy for correct continuity. Make sure the connector link  is tightened properly.

# Damage Identification  

During the inspection process, the rigger may identify various  discrepancies in the materials and/or the assemblies. While  the following inspection processes call out what to look for,  the specific descriptions and treatment of the damage are  provided in Chapter 7, Repairs, Alterations, and Manufacture.

# Pilot Chute and Bridle  

1.	 Check the spring shape and tension; it should not  have an excessive bend to the length of the spring.  There should be no kinks in the wire or sharp edges or  burrs. The swages should be smooth and tight. Check  the tension of the spring against the manufacturer’s  specifications. Most current springs have between  20–30 pounds of tension, but some run as high as  40–45 pounds. Too strong a spring is rarely an issue,  but too weak often is a problem. Some manufacturers  specify a testing method and frequency of testing.  

2.	 Check the canopy cap for security to the canopy  portion along the stitching and seams. If it has a  grommet in the cap or an alignment strap, check the  grommets for tightness and smooth edges on the  inside. Sharp edges can cut the locking loop. Check  the alignment strap for centering and tacking.  

3.	 Check the canopy fabric for any holes, burns, stains, or  other damage. Check the seams for loose stitching and  look over the mesh portion, if used. Small holes may  be allowed, but consult the manufacturer’s manual.  Check the attachment loop at the base of the pilot  chute for security. Check any hand tacking, if used,  to secure the spring to the base of the pilot chute.  

4.	 If the parachute uses a sewn-on bridle, check the  stitching. If it is a tied-on model, check the knots and  any hand tacking called out in the instructions. Be sure  to check the length against the parts list. Make sure  the canopy end of the bridle is looped around the apex  lines and not around a tension loop. If a floating loop  is called out, make sure the locator tacking is secure.  

# Reserve Canopy  

If available, use a canopy damage chart appropriate to  the canopy for documenting your inspection for repair of  any damage found.  Figure 5-10  shows a typical chart for  round canopies.  

![](images/4e3cefa8726c7818c5371e13f9e3e9755871ed0b0d4d0596d7a5f17ef8b7e3e9.jpg)  
Figure 5-10.  Round canopy damage chart.  

1.	 Check the apex lines for damage and continuity, as  well as the upper lateral band. If there is a tension  loop, make sure it is secure. If there is a vent collar  ring, check the elasticity of the material.  

2.	 Inspect gores and panel fabrics by starting at the top  center gore of the canopy, working your way up one  gore while inspecting the fabric, seams, tapes, and  lines. When you reach the apex, pull the next radial  seam toward you, stretching out the fabric, and work  your way down the gore to the lower lateral band.  [Figure 5-11]  This method is the most efficient use of  your time and physical efforts. Work your way around  the canopy, inspecting each gore from top to bottom.  

![](images/85917ea451ed40956ce55feecb49712601376c9d230cf51c27242998efcf72e5.jpg)  
Figure 5-11.  Round canopy gore inspection.  

3.	 The manufacturer may call for the tensile testing of the  fabric after inspection of the canopy for obvious visual  damage. This is very important because there was a  fabric deterioration problem with certain parachutes  several years ago. An AD was issued, and while the  exact cause was never determined, a side benefit was  the development and adoption of a non-destructive  fabric pull test method. This method was adopted by  the PIA as Technical Standard (TS)-108, Parachute  Canopy Fabric Pull Test, Non-Destructive Method.  This method of testing canopy fabric for strength  has been adopted by several canopy manufacturers  as suitable for testing their canopies. However, the  rigger must be careful in using this test method. The  proper equipment is essential for accurate testing and  the type of material must be known in order to test to  the correct strength. The testing equipment is shown  in  Figure 5-12 . The full standard can be found in  Appendix I of this handbook.  

4.	 Along with the pull test, the AD also requires testing  the canopy mesh with a solution of Bromo Cresol  Green indicator to determine the presence of an acid  condition. The Bromo Cresol Green indicator is a dark  blue liquid in its standard state. It turns yellow when  

![](images/5fadad4a355e02bb8323128e405fbaaaef2f967b8148f3610aaf51f164a48bf6.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.  TS-108 test equipment.  

it contacts acid—the stronger the acid, the brighter  the yellow. If the test is positive, the canopy needs  to be treated to neutralize the condition. The AD  highlights the manufacturer’s service bulletin as to  how to comply with this test and procedure.  

5.	 If the canopy has a deployment device, such as a  diaper, check that it is securely attached, particularly  after use. Check the grommets, line stow bands,  elastics, or other line stow devices. Pay particular  attention to where the stitching attaches to the canopy  fabric. This area can be particularly prone to damage  during opening.  

# Suspension Lines and Connector Links  

1.	 The lines, their attachment points, and the associated  stitching should be checked for damage or missing  stitches. With the older sheath and core nylon lines,  such as Type-III found on military surplus canopies,  the zigzag stitching at the links are prone to raveling.  The more modern non-continuous line canopies  use Dacron ®  or nylon braided lines. The common  attachment at the links for these lines uses the “finger- trap” method to secure the lines to the link with a bar  tack securing the lines. Most manufacturers now use  a contrasting color thread for the bar tack in order to  make inspection easier. Make sure all bar tacks are  in place.  Figure 5-13  shows both methods of line  attachment to the links.  

2.	 There are three basic types of separable connector  links in common use today for round canopies: the  

![](images/b3cbffcb1dd0ac7dda2a09e6a8714ea1ae78216877d1a2c2401091dc92bcd737.jpg)  
Figure 5-13.  Connector link line attachment methods.  

standard “L” bar type, MS-22002; the Navy speed  link, MS-22021, and the Quick link, commonly called  the Maillon Rapide ®  link (named after the French  company that first manufactured them).  [Figure 5-14] The older military surplus canopies are usually found  with the two types of MIL-SPEC connector links.  Modern sport canopies usually are found with the  Rapide ®  links because of their compatibility with the  modern, low-bulk suspension lines.  

![](images/41bf7afd3042343f8b08c76dda430fe3734b0ee53d5cde0200c3b95b021d3227.jpg)  
Figure 5-14.  Three types of connector links.  

3.	 With the MIL-SPEC links, check the tightness of the  screws that hold the links together. With the speed links,  make sure the knurled side of the end cap is facing up  and the plates face outboard on the riser. The screw  should be checked for tightness at each repack.  

4.	 If the canopy is equipped with Rapide ®  links, they  should be oriented on the riser with the barrel inboard  and to the bottom so it tightens upward. The link  should be tightened hand tight, then approximately one  quarter turn further. The actual force recommended  for a number 5 link is approximately 30 inch-pounds.  Most riggers do not possess the force gauge to measure  this, so they use the quarter turn guide. After tightening  the links, a “telltale” should be applied to the barrel.  [Figure 5-15]  A telltale is a marker, usually nail  polish, that provides a breakable seal to show if the  barrel has moved. If the seal is broken, the rigger  knows the link may be loose. In doing a repack, if the  telltale is intact, the rigger should not loosen the link  and retighten it because continual tightening can strip  the threads, causing the link to fail.  

![](images/63704662eb458dbb83b0834da1f7504cf57bccfb9c02388f2a5526f97e5e7b35.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  Telltale marker.  

# Harness  

1.	 Starting at the riser end, check the webbing for any wear  or damage and inspect the stitching at the riser ends. If  the canopy has steering lines and a guide ring on the  riser, make sure the ring is secure and the steering line  is attached to the steering toggle correctly. With a round  canopy, make sure the steering line has sufficient slack  in it when under tension. If the line is too tight, it can  fail at opening because of too much stretch.  

2.	 Continue down the risers. If canopy releases are  installed, check their operation. With the Capewell  cable release, open the release and make sure there  is no dirt or sand in the mechanism. Also, check for  wear, particularly on the cable ring.  

3.	 Check all of the harness webbing for wear from  chafing, abrasion, and sunlight degradation. Pay  particular attention to the buffer and chafing strips  where used to prevent wear from the hardware. These  buffers are there to provide early warning before  the load-bearing webbing starts to wear. Check the  elastic keepers so the running ends of the straps can  be properly stowed.  

4.	 Check all of the hardware, paying particular attention  to the leg snaps. Quick ejectors are particularly prone  to failure of the springs. Obviously, those with broken  springs should be replaced. B-12 snaps are prone to  having the gate sides bent to the point they do not close  properly. This gate may be repaired with a screwdriver  and pliers.  [Figure 5-16]  Straightening the side of the  gate allows the snap to close properly.  

![](images/088b9af95308cead824aea80515e8b0d8a6650b60c6fc6d96717345d1c2b1d7e.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.  B-12 snap gate repair.  

5.	 An area of concern for many riggers, one for which  there is not much guidance, is how much plating wear  and associated corrosion of the hardware is allowable.  This depends on the location of the damage. If it is a  solid ring or buckle, and the damage has occurred from  dragging or abrasion in an area that is not in contact  with webbing, one solution is to clean the rust with  a fine emery cloth and cover it with clear nail polish.  This keeps the area from continued rusting. It does  not, however, prevent further damage caused by the  original rusting. If the rusting is caused by two pieces  of hardware interacting with each other, the problem  is more serious. If allowed to continue, the rust pattern  may cause the two pieces to fuse together under the  most severe conditions. In this case, the hardware  must be removed and replaced. If the hardware in  contact with webbing, such as a leg strap adapter, and  becomes corroded, it must be replaced. This problem  frequently arises when the parachute is exposed to  salt water and not properly rinsed. The hardware rusts  inside the leg strap webbing causing accelerated wear  and must definitely be replaced.  [Figure 5-17]  

6.	 The ripcord housing and pocket should be checked for  wear and fit of the ripcord. On the housing, check the  ends and the ferrules. On more modern assemblies,  these ferrules are brass and more susceptible to wear  than the MILSPEC types. Look inside to make sure  there are no obstructions to interfere with the ripcord.  

![](images/32f2f3faf535362d16ec3aaac139ec4d695def41f34279cf60994313eadf44fa.jpg)  
Figure 5-17.  Rusty leg snap hardware.  

The ripcord pocket may be elastic, Velcro ® , or a  military style with a spring to hold in the ripcord.  Whichever type, make sure the ripcord is held  securely, yet at the same time make sure it is not too  tight so the ripcord can be removed easily. Also, check  the tackings that hold the housing and pocket.  

# Container  

1.	 As stated in the beginning of this chapter, the initial  external inspection of the container should alert the  rigger to any damage inside. Note any holes, abrasion,  or fraying of the pack material.  

2.	 Check the grommets for sharp edges and pulling out  of the material from under the grommet. Cones should  have the stitching secure. Check the plating on the  cones in the area of the eye. Sharp edges can cause  a cone lock. Eyelets should have the tacking secure.  Snap fasteners should be securely set in the material.  Check for wear and security of the opposing parts.  Make sure that “pull-the-dot” types are set correctly  for direction. Stiffeners, both metal and plastic, should  not be bent or cracked. There should be no sharp edges.  Pack opening bands (POBs), if used, should be in good  shape and not stretched out. Make sure the hooks are  in good shape, too. On the military style POBs, it  may be necessary to retack the pull tabs at the end.  Metal frames, if used, should be straight. Buffers at  the corners should be in good condition. Tackings, if  used, should be secure.  

3.	 The container-closing loop is an extremely important  part of the container system. A worn loop may fail,  which would cause a premature opening of the  container. With the parachute still in a packed condition,  check for the correct length. If the loop is made too  long or stretched during use, the pilot chute can extend  and move off center. This may result in a poor launch  or a pack job that is uncomfortable for the user. After  determining that the loop is of the correct material and  length, check the eye(s) of the loop on the inside for  wear. It is not uncommon for the loop to appear to be  in good condition when viewed from the outside but  worn partially through when examined from the inside.  [Figure 5-18]  Many riggers simply replace the loops  at each repack, regardless of the condition.  

![](images/5b877c779b9a820cb1ad628a79fa12c671e89055cbd62cb4058da2a638e9cd86.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.  Worn closing loop.  

# Ripcord  

There are a number of things that need to be inspected to  approve the ripcord:  

1.	 Check the pin(s) for straightness, smoothness, cracks,  or other damage. 2.	 Check the cable for fraying, kinks, or severe bends. 3.	 Check the swage for wear and security. Look for signs  of movement on the cable. 4.	 Check the handle for wear, damage, rust, or abuse.  

Any damage or discrepancies found during the inspection  should be noted and the appropriate repair performed by a  certificated and appropriately-rated rigger according to the  manufacturer’s instructions or approved manuals.  

# Airing and Drying  

During the inspection process, the rigger must determine the  condition of the canopy and system regarding dryness and  moisture. In the past, it was necessary for the parachute to be  aired and dried for 24 hours prior to packing it. According  to 14 CFR part 65, section 65.129(c), “No certificated  parachute rigger may pack a parachute that has not been  thoroughly dried and aired.” This determination is at the  discretion of the rigger.  

# Ram-Air Reserves and Sport Piggyback Systems  

The following inspection procedures share much with the  previous section on round canopies. The differences between  ram-air reserves and sport piggyback systems are identified  in the following section. Inspect as follows:  

# Pilot Chute and Free Bag/Bridle  

1.	 The rigger should inspect the pilot chute in the same  manner as in the section on round canopies.  

2.	 The free bag should be checked to include all  grommets, especially those bags that have a through  loop configuration. Any sharpness in this area can  result in a damaged closing loop. For those free bags  that utilize a Safety-Stow ®  locking system, make  sure the elastic loop is of the correct size, the elastic  is in good shape, and the zigzag stitching is secure.  Many riggers fabricate these loops in the field, which  in most cases, is an unauthorized procedure. The  Safety-Stow ®  loop is an integral part of the approved  reserve deployment system and is manufactured under  an approved quality control system from approved  materials. The rigger should use only OEM-approved  parts for this.  

3.	 Check the bridle for any damage or wear. For those  bridles that have assistor pockets, make sure the  stitching is secure and the pockets are not damaged.  Check the Velcro ®  on the line stow pocket for wear  and security. If the Velcro ®  does not hold securely,  the parachute can experience “line dump” during  deployment, possibly causing a malfunction or out  of sequence deployment. Some deployment bags use  rubber bands to stow the lines. If this is the case, check  their condition and replace them if necessary.  

4.	 There are still older ram-air canopies in the field that  did not use a free bag but a diaper deployment system.  If this is the case, the diaper should be inspected the  same as that on a round canopy. Be sure to use the  correct type and length of bridle, since it is generally  not the same as a round bridle.  

# Ram-Air Reserve Canopy  

Shown in  Figure 5-19  is a typical ram-air reserve and  harness and container system layout. The terminology used  in describing the parts of the ram-air canopy is called out in  PIA Technical Standard TS-100, Standardized Nomenclature  for Ram-air Inflated Gliding Parachutes, which can be found  in Appendix I of this handbook.  

![](images/e26faa4c5502f5ab299a246426e35b789e65d64cb78a93f10a12e0c5f47fe427.jpg)  
Figure 5-19.  Ram-air/piggyback layout.  

1.	 When inspecting and assembling ram-air canopies,  begin with the upper surface of the canopy.  [Figure 5-20]  Work your way up and down the  top panel of the cells looking for any damage or  contamination. Check the seams for loose stitching  and packing tabs if used, for security. 2.	 Check the trailing edge seam for secure stitching,  paying particular attention to the line attachment  

![](images/a56b0eaa780de6d171540e42a8f3c26aba47776a384f11e6149317bd5d001f12.jpg)  
Figure 5-20.  Ram-air canopy hanger—top skin inspection.  

tapes and their associated bar tacks. Next, look at the  interior of the cells, carefully checking the crossports  for damage or fraying of the edges of the fabric.  

3.	 Now proceed to the lower surface of the canopy.  Carefully check all the seams and the line attachment  tapes and bar tacks.  

4.	 Some manufacturers require the use of PIA Technical  Standard TS-108, Canopy Fabric Pull Test, at certain  intervals. In addition, the manufacturer’s warning/ TSO label may require that the rigger mark the label  to signify each time it is repacked and after each  use.  [Figure 5-21]  This label is found on the upper  surface trailing edge of the canopy. It is important  to comply with this requirement, not only because  the manufacturer requires it, but also it establishes  the trail of use for the canopy, which allows future  riggers (and the manufacturer) to track its use and  condition over time. Some riggers feel that they are  doing their customers a favor by not marking the  boxes in order to show it has little use when it comes  to selling it. Since most individuals have a specific  rigger pack their parachute on a regular basis, it does  not take a lot of detective work to inspect the rigger’s  logbook to see how many times they have packed  any particular parachute.  

# Canopy Assembly and Line Continuity  

The first task is to check the line continuity of the canopy.  The following method may be used by riggers who do not  have access to a canopy hanger.  Figure 5-22  shows examples  of a seven-cell and nine-cell canopy when viewed from the  bottom as by the jumper when in flight. The examples show  the line attachment nomenclature referred to in the continuity  check.  Figure 5-23  shows the standard canopy nomenclature  as referred to in the continuity check.

Figure 5-21.  PIA warning label.  

1.	 First, lay out the canopy on its left side, the slider  spanwise with its tape down, and lay out the container  with the harness up.

 2.	 If slider bumpers are used, thread one bumper over  each riser and down a few inches.

 3.	 Place the slider on the risers spanwise with its tape  facing the canopy.

 4.	 Locate the leading edge and A line attachment. Follow  the line 8A (10A) to the outboard side of its link and  attach the link to the right riser, finger tight.

 5.	 Pick up line 1A at the canopy attach point. Follow it  down to the outboard side of its link and attach the  link to the left front riser, finger tight.

6.	 Turn the container over, harness down, and orient  the rear risers to receive their respective links. This  simplifies C/D link attachment.

 7.	 Rotate the leading edge under the rest of the canopy.  Split the aft section along with its associated control  line groups to make the C/D links easily accessible  for routing and installation.  

8.	 Locate the data panel at the center cell’s upper surface  trailing edge. From this center reference point, follow  the trailing edge to the left stabilizer and pick up  line 1D.

 9. 	 Route this line to the outboard side of its link and  attach the link to the left rear riser, finger tight.

 10.	 Again from the center reference, follow the trailing  edge to the right stabilizer and pick up line 8D (10D).

 11.	 Route this line to the outboard side of its link and  attach the link to the right rear riser, finger tight.

 12.	 Return to the center reference point of the trailing edge.  Locate and pick up the left side upper control lines  consecutively. Verify their continuity to the junction  with the lower control line.

 13.	 Removing twists as you go, follow the left lower control  line to its running end. Route it through the appropriate  slider grommet and then through the guide ring.

 14.	 Remove the toggle from the riser and route the running  end of the lower control line through the toggle  attachment loop or grommet.

 15.	 Slide the toggle up to the mark on the control line.  Secure it with an overhand knot tied closely to  the toggle. 

 16.	 The control line attachment for the right side is done  in a similar manner.

 17.	 When the control line installation is complete,  compare the two toggle settings under equal tension  to ensure their uniformity.

 18.	 At this time, verify the continuity of the control line  system. Begin at the trailing edge on each side, ensuring  that all twists have been removed from the upper and  lower control lines. Check that the lower control lines  have been properly routed through their appropriate  slider grommets and that the toggles have been properly  secured equidistant from the trailing edge.

 19.	 Separate the aft section and control line groups to their  respective sides and locate the center reference point  at the trailing edge.

 20.	 Following the trailing edge control surface outboard  leads the rigger to the left stabilizer’s bottom seam  and the attachment point of line 1D.

 21.	 Holding D lines 1,2,3, and 4 (1,2,3,4,5) in your right  hand and D lines 5,6,7, and 8 (6,7,8,9,10) in your left  hand, verify the continuity of the C and D lines through  the cascades to their respective rear risers.

 22.	 Gather in the control lines and flip the canopy over so  the leading edge faces up. Verify this orientation by  locating the attachment points of A lines 1 and 8 (10).  

23.	 In the same direction you flipped the canopy, rotate  the container system harness up.  

24.	 Pick up the front riser groups, follow them to the  canopy, and separate.  

25.	 Pick up A lines 8,7,6, and 5 (10, 9,8,7,6). If you have  continuous center cell lines, follow the bottom seam  down and pick up line 5B (6B). Verify continuity of  the A and B lines, through the cascades, to the right  front riser.  

26. Pick up A lines 1,2,3, and 4 (and 5). If you have  continuous center cell lines, follow the bottom seam  down and pick up line 4B (5B). Verify continuity  through the cascades to the left front riser. The  continuity check is now complete.  

27.	 Tighten the connector links with an appropriate size  wrench. Do not over tighten. Inspect the links for any  marks or damage possibly done during the tightening  process. Mark the barrel of the connector links with a  telltale mark.  

28.	 Move the slider upward from the risers onto the  suspension lines.  

29.	 Move the slider bumpers upwards and into position  over the connector links. Hand tack the bumpers in  place according to the type used.  

# Inspection  

1.	 Starting at the lower surface of the canopy, check the  line attachment loops and their associated bar tacks.  Follow the line downward to the cascade junction,  if applicable, and check the bar tack at this location.  Continue down the line to the connector links and  check the bottom loop and bar tack.  

2.	 Starting at the top and working your way downward,  inspect the steering lines. Check all junctions and bar  tacks, paying particular attention to the brake loops.  Check the security of the steering toggles to ensure  the correct attachment method is followed. If the  toggles are improperly tied, they may come off when  the jumper deploys the brakes. Make sure the toggle  matches the size of the brake loops. If they are too  large, they may hang up and not release when needed.  For compatibility, the toggles should be those supplied  with the harness and container.  

3.	 If Rapide ®  links are used on the canopy, check them  as set forth in the section on round canopies. The link  orientation and tightness is the same. Some canopy  manufacturers provide and prescribe the use of “slider  bumpers” with their canopies. These are made from  either webbing or from vinyl or rubber tubing and are  designed to protect the grommets of the slider from  impacting the connector links during deployment. If  these bumpers are used, it is recommended that they be  tacked in such a manner that they cannot slide up the  lines and interfere with the slider during deployment.  [Figure 5-24]  

![](images/d579c79ce8065787c6e942f6d102b7b05a890874846fc8b8a45d7ea33503e1f1.jpg)  
Figure 5-24.  Slider bumpers.  

4.	 A type of connector link, called the soft link, is  used with certain reserve canopies.  [Figure 5-25] Manufactured from Spectra ®  line, they loop through the  bottom of the suspension line and the end of the reserve  riser. The strength of these soft links far exceeds that of  the metal links when installed properly. If installed on  the reserve, the rigger should have the manufacturer’s  instructions to ensure the correct installation.  

![](images/d96b25a13274b4e034995bc219aede00cc29d2423275368299bb34058d360ebf.jpg)  
Figure 5-25.  Soft links.  

# Container  

1.	 When inspecting the harness, start at the riser end,  checking the condition of the webbing and stitching.  Pay particular attention to the security of the steering  line guide rings and the method of stowing the excess  steering line. If these guide rings fail, it can result in  fatal consequences to the user.  

2.	 Check all of the hardware on the harness in the same  manner detailed in the Pilot Emergency Parachute  Section in this chapter.  

3.	 Check the canopy release system for wear and operation.  The release in almost universal use today is the  ${\operatorname{3-Rin}}^{\scriptscriptstyle(\!\mathrm{g})}$  release system.  [Figure 5-26]  With this system, it is  imperative that the rigger also checks the release cable  housings for security and cleanliness. Without proper  maintenance, this system can be subject to hard pull  forces and the inability to release properly. Since the  successful operation of the reserve deployment is  somewhat dependent on cleanly releasing the main,  a properly operating release system is necessary. The  primary areas for inspection are the release locator  Velcro ®  on the harness and the cable housings. Check  the housing ends for sharp edges on the inside of the  grommets. If the housings are tacked to the harness,  make sure these are secure. If the customer did not bring  the main canopy with the reserve, the rigger should  encourage the customer to at least bring the   ${\operatorname{3-Rin}}^{\scriptscriptstyle(\!\mathrm{g})}$  release handle in for inspection and service.  

![](images/bc6fb00977bc71707803e50a6377e6b65e2189992efd5e554829fdce61547623.jpg)  
Figure 5-26.  3-Ring ®  release system.  

In addition to those container areas referenced under the  pilot emergency system, the sport piggyback container has  features unique to this configuration.  

1.	 Check the installation of the AAD, if one is installed,  making sure the stowage pockets, cutter mounts, and  control unit are secure. Check that the cables are routed  correctly. If they are exposed, they may get snagged  

during packing and damaged or disconnected. Upon  completion, inspect the condition of the closing loop. 2.	 Check the RSL. The RSL is not considered part of  the certified reserve system, but if it is installed, the  rigger is responsible for the entire RSL assembly since  it is attached to the ripcord handle, cable, or housing.  This includes the cable housings for tacking and  security, any guide rings used, and the RSL lanyard  itself. Check the release or snap shackle, if used, and  any Velcro ®  or other positioning or locating methods.  An area frequently overlooked is the RSL attachment  ring on the main risers, which are frequently replaced.  [Figure 5-27]  In many cases, the attachment ring does  not match up to the original design. The rigger should  inspect the release handle for proper cable lengths.  If the design has only one riser attached to the RSL,  it is imperative that the cables be trimmed to release  the side opposite the lanyard first so that the reserve  is not deployed before the risers are separated from  the harness.  

![](images/2ece3ead1ce648408ffcec2f3f66961d10080fdd81ae126f56bdb18a125b8984.jpg)  
Figure 5-27.  RSL/riser attachment.  

3.	 Check the main deployment system, of which there  are three basic types in use today. The first is a ripcord  similar to the pilot emergency system. The second  type is the throw-out pilot chute (TOP). The third is  the pull-out pilot chute (POP).  

a.	 Next, inspect the main ripcord system. Check  the ripcord and main pilot chute the same as with  the pilot emergency system. Inspect the ripcord  pocket for proper holding of the ripcord handle.  

b.	 For throw-out pilot chutes, inspect the pilot  chute fabric and mesh for holes. Check the TOP  handle at the top of the pilot chute for security,  paying special attention to the tape holding the  handle, which is particularly prone to wear.  Check the bridle attachment to the pilot chute.  If it is of a centerline collapsible design, check  the centerline for wear and stretch and make  sure the length of the bridle is correct. Check  the curved locking pin for wear or damage as  well as the tape, which attaches it to the bridle.  [Figure 5-28]  Check the pilot chute pocket for  fit and wear. Most of today’s installations are  what is known as a “bottom of container” (BOC)  configuration. It is particularly important that the  elastic material from which the pocket is made is  in good condition. A loose pocket can result in a  premature deployment of the main parachute.  

c.	 If repacking a pull-out parachute, check the pilot  chute and bridle in the same manner of the throw- out parachute inspection. Check the lanyard and  handle for wear.  

![](images/ce296036ef77187d0e96ef002de4b23e6c371cefeaa4585c2b0f585bd5c12dd2.jpg)  
Figure 5-28.  TOP bridle with worn pin tape.  

4.	 If Velcro ®  is used on the main pin protector flap, be  sure to inspect its condition. If a plastic closing flap  or tongue is used, check for deformation or breakage.  [Figure 5-29]  

![](images/79ddb257d8693c82808e19dc63979a4e9f95e60a7b59a70b2dae8e0996649e0b.jpg)  
Figure 5-29.  Main pin protector flap plastic breakage.  

5.	 If Velcro ®  is used on the main riser covers, be sure to  check its condition. If plastic, check for breakage and  deformation. If the plastic is excessively deformed, it  is a sign that the covers do not fit properly and may  open prematurely causing problems. 6.	 For the container-closing loop, the same criteria  applies as in the pilot emergency parachute. In  addition, make sure the loop material is the same as  specified in the owner’s manual, especially if an AAD  is installed. With certain AADs, a particular type of  knot and washer to be used is specified as well.  

# Ripcord  

All the areas mentioned in the pilot emergency parachute  section apply to the sport rig. In addition, some assemblies  utilize a ripcord that has a webbing loop handle or a  pillow-type handle similar to the   ${\operatorname{3-Rin}}\mathbb{g}^{\mathfrak{g}}$   release handle.  [Figure 5-30]  It is important that the rigger check these  handles for proper markings and fit to the assembly. Make  sure that there is sufficient slack in the cable to allow no  loading of the pin in any attitude or position that the wearer  may conceivably get into. Most, if not all of these style  handles, utilize Velcro ®  to secure them to the harness. Make  sure the Velcro ®  is in good condition for holding ability but  not so much as to inhibit the pull force.  

Remember, while both the pilot emergency parachute and sport  piggyback assemblies share many areas in common, each has  peculiar requirements for its use. It is important for the rigger  to recognize these and handle each system accordingly.  

![](images/20cbbb3aa8e186f24e164fd44ce73814c46b77aa7bd0140172c01e444fb002b6.jpg)

# Rigging and Repairs  

When the entire assembly inspection is complete, the rigger  has a list of the discrepancies found during the procedure. At  this point, a determination must be made on how to remedy  these defects. For senior riggers, certain remedial action may  be outside the scope of their certificate. If so, those riggers  need to find an appropriately certificated and rated rigger to  do the work or return the parachute to the manufacturer for  repair. In the case of major canopy or harness work, this may  be the best solution regardless.  

Aside from the qualification limitations of the rigger, the  manufacturer may be better equipped to perform major repair  or overhaul. They have the original patterns, templates, and  design data, as well as the certified materials. In addition,  their labor rate is probably less than what the rigger may  charge the customer, particularly if he or she has not done  this repair before. The factory has the experience and practice  that results in the repair looking just like new. While some  riggers may look at any given project with anticipation, they  also need to look at what is best for the customer.  

Many times, the master rigger has a repair facility and stocks  it with the necessary materials. In most cases, these materials  come from sources with no traceability as to their origin.  The manufacturer is required to use only those materials  that have been tested, certified, and approved to meet the  standards of their quality control system under the TSO  system. During one recent routine inspection and repack, the  rigger found severe failure of the harness stitching at the main  lift web/leg strap junction. Upon further examination, it was  determined that the thread used to sew the harness was not  nylon. The harness was returned to the manufacturer, who  then determined that the thread was indeed cotton and not the  required nylon. The thread broke at approximately 10 pounds  versus 45 pounds for 5-cord nylon. Further investigation  revealed that the harness was originally manufactured with  a harness size three inches shorter. There were telltale marks  left from where the original harness was stitched. This  modification was evidently performed by someone who  either was not qualified to perform the work or had gotten a  batch of the wrong thread by mistake and did not recognize  the difference. Attempts to find out who did the alteration  were unsuccessful. The manufacturer repaired the harness  at no charge and returned it to the customer. To preclude  this type of problem, many professional riggers and lofts  establish good working relationships with the manufacturers  and procure certain materials from them. They keep these  marked and in a separate area and use them only on the  appropriate projects.  

Another area of concern is a master rigger who does major  alterations without proper approval of the manufacturer.  The rigger may do major repairs to return the assembly to  its original condition without further authorization of the  Administrator or manufacturer, but alterations are another  story. Title 14 CFR part 65, section 65.129(e), states that “No  certificated parachute rigger may pack, maintain, or alter a  parachute in any manner that deviates from the procedures  approved by the Administrator or the manufacturer of the  parachute.” There are a number of common alterations  seen in the field. Among them are: harness re-sizing, AAD  installations, RSL retrofits, chest strap relocation, and  others. The manufacturer’s approval can vary from a verbal  message over the phone to a formal engineering procedure  complete with drawings and specifications. If the work is  done correctly, the truth probably lies somewhere in the  middle. If riggers want to ensure they are following code,  they should obtain some form of written approval from the  manufacturer in whatever form they provide.  

The bottom line is that the purpose of the system is to  provide an infrastructure that ensures the safety of the public.  Professional riggers strive to do the right thing both morally  and legally.  

# Packing  

Packing is the heart of the rigging profession. Once riggers  satisfy all the necessary inspection requirements, they may  then proceed with the packing process. This section describes  a generic round parachute packing method into a modern  back-type pilot emergency system. The steps for doing this  are common to most parachutes of similar types. Once the  basics are mastered, it is a simple matter of following the  manufacturer’s instructions for other makes and models.  

# Round Canopy into a Pilot Emergency Parachute  System  

The steps for packing this type of parachute are broken down  into the following sections:  

1.	 Layout 2.	 Flaking and pleating the canopy 3.	 Folding the skirt and the long fold 4.	 Closing the diaper and stowing the lines 5.	 Skirt or diaper placement 6.	 Accordion fold of the canopy into the container 7.	 Closing the container  

Before beginning, the rigger must have the necessary tools  to pack the parachute. The packing manual includes a list  of tools necessary for the procedure.  Figure 5-31  shows the  recommended tools needed to pack the parachute described in  this section. Do not forget to count your tools before beginning.

Figure 5-31.  Round parachute packing tools.  

# Layout  

1.	 The parachute must be positioned on the table face  down with the wearer’s head toward the canopy. The  rear of the canopy faces up. Normally the data panel  is on the middle gore that faces up.  [Figure 5-32] 2.	 Attach the canopy tension loop to the upper table  tension device, then attach the connector links or  risers to a tension board or similar device at the  bottom of the table.  [Figure 5-33]  Be sure to apply  light tension. 3.	 Straighten the apex of the canopy making sure  the lower lateral band or skirt is somewhat even.  [Figure 5-34]  Apply additional tension to the canopy  and lines.  

![](images/234e90c8ac7bed7466ee39e93c6e494304a99779558d46a63366b6b9ab07e98b.jpg)

# Pleating the Canopy  

1.	 Flake the canopy in the normal manner with an equal  number of gores to each side.  Figures 5-35  through  5-41 show the proper technique.  

![](images/ee47453bf5c4f3c04085a92f35a7ac4ec2371dd2827637b826b399f74321c53f.jpg)

2.	 Pleat the canopy with an equal number of gores  to each side. Make sure the canopy skirt is even.  [Figures 5-42  through  5-44]  

# Fold the Skirt  

1.	 Fold the skirt so it is parallel to the radial seams.  [Figure 5-45]

Figure 5-47.  Fifths 2.  

# Closing the Diaper and Stowing the Lines  

1.	 Pull the container towards the canopy and form a  loop of suspension lines above the top of the diaper.  [Figure 5-49]  Be sure to leave enough room to close  the diaper.

 2.	 Close the diaper starting with the top grommet. Lock  the grommet with a bight of line no more that 1.5  inches long.  [Figure 5-50]  Close the middle grommet  in the same manner.  [Figure 5-51]

# Skirt or Diaper Placement  

1.	 Lay the risers in the container and close the riser  covers. Insert pull-up cords into both ends of the  closing loop. 2.	 Turn the skirt of the canopy 90 degrees and lay one  edge of the diaper even with the top edge and inside  the pack tray.  [Figure 5-54]  

![](images/f3c5b100c1401fb6a648eb76156e01ccd0db997f1fc8c4ce7903ee71780e64b6.jpg)  
Figure 5-54.  Diaper stow.  

4.	 Finish stowing the remainder of the suspension  lines using bights no more than 1.5 inches long.  [Figure 5-53]  

# Accordion Folding the Canopy  

1.	 Fold the canopy toward the bottom of the container  leaving enough to fill the upper corner of the container.  

2.	 Fold the canopy toward the bottom of the container  and leave approximately 4 inches of canopy past the  bottom.  [Figure 5-55]  

![](images/2b0da7bea148fc6e331b8e14d5b0c9e87130e020fee381961f01d0cc7a275109.jpg)  
Figure 5-55.  S fold 1.  

3.	 Fold the canopy back towards the top of the container  and spread the canopy sideways to fill out the width of  the container.  [Figure 5-56]  Make two folds between  the lower edge of the diaper and the lower end of the  closing loop.  [Figure 5-57]  

![](images/6e4f3d32be4b418b350cfa02600cb91763023be7945970d4f54bdcee3b2fb63a.jpg)  
Figure 5-56.  S fold 2.  

4.	 Lay the remainder of the canopy and apex across the  middle of the container and fold in an appropriate  manner to fill the empty area of the container on the  pack tray stiffener below the diaper.  [Figure 5-58]

# Ripcord Pull Force  

The correct packing is the most important aspect of repacking  a parachute, but the cosmetic appearance of the container is  important as well. This is true both for a pilot emergency  and a sport piggyback system. Pilots want their parachute as  snug and as flat as possible to keep the parachute comfortable  when in use. Skydivers want theirs as snug and streamlined  as possible so it stays closed during free fall. The key to  these requirements is to make sure the pilot chute is held  down securely. To do that, the closing loop needs to be as  short as the rigger can make it and still meet the requirements  for the maximum pull force. Under the TSO system, the  maximum allowable pull force for the ripcord is 22 pounds.  Most riggers develop a feel for the closing of the container  and the resultant force. However, new riggers need to check  their packing technique to measure the pull force, which is  done without a seal or thread.  

Start by having someone put on the parachute to replicate  the real shape and conformity of the parachute system. To  pull the ripcord while the parachute is lying on the table is  not realistic. The rigger then takes the ripcord handle from  the pocket and attaches a calibrated scale to it.  [Figure 5-64] Ideally, a recording scale should be used to register the  

![](images/7bf8d7a7894191191c14bd0a46d6cf3620aed623d88201bc940510255ab1af65.jpg)  
Figure 5-64.  Ripcord pull test.  

maximum force during the pull. Next, the rigger needs to  pull the ripcord in a smooth, quick motion, duplicating the  motion of the user and the test requirements of the TSO.  Take note of the force required to pull the ripcord pin(s)  clear of the locking loop(s) and activate the system. If the  force is less than 22 pounds, the rigger can then re-close the  container and seal the ripcord. If the force is over 22 pounds,  the rigger must make whatever adjustments are needed, such  as lengthening the locking loop or re-stowing the canopy, to  achieve a pull force below 22 pounds.  

# Sealing the Parachute  

As stated in 14 CFR part 65, section 65.133, “Each  certificated parachute rigger must have a seal with an  identifying mark prescribed by the Administrator, and  a seal press. After packing a parachute, he shall seal the  pack with his seal in accordance with the manufacturer’s  recommendation for that type of parachute.” Most manuals  simply say to “seal the parachute.” The following describes  a commonly approved method.  

Take a length of seal thread approximately 20 inches  long. Fold in half and make two lark’s head knots around  the ripcord cable adjacent to the shank of the ripcord pin.  [Figure 5-65]  Pass one end of the thread through the seal and  then under the pin on the opposite side of the locking loop or  cone.  [Figure 5-66]  Bring the end back through the second  hole in the seal and tie a knot with the other end of the thread.  [Figure 5-67]  Leave enough slack in the thread to allow for  movement of the pin without breaking the thread. However,  make sure the pin cannot be extracted from the locking loop  without breaking the thread. Slide the seal over the knot and  compress the seal with the seal press.  [Figure 5-68]  Trim  the excess thread.

Figure 5-65.  Lark’s head the thread on the cable.  

Count all of your tools. Fill in the appropriate information  on the packing data card and the rigger’s logbook. Place the  data card in the packing data card pocket.

# Ram-Air Reserve into a Sport Piggyback System  

In the preceding text, the discussion is centered on a parachute  system that was already assembled. This next section  focuses on the assembly of a ram-air parachute system, the  component parts, and the process from the assembly stage  through to packing. While this section provides guidance  and an overview of packing a ram-air canopy into a sport  piggyback system, it is imperative that the rigger receive  proper training from a certificated and properly rated rigger  who has been trained to pack ram-air reserves. Title 14 CFR  part 65, section 65.129(f) states, “No certificated parachute  rigger may exercise the privileges of his certificate and type  rating unless he understands the current manufacturer’s  instructions for the operation involved...”  

The following procedure is typical of many current 1-pin  container systems. While this configuration comprises the  majority of those manufactured today, there are other designs  still in use that require different techniques. The rigger must  become thoroughly familiar with the other configurations  before attempting to assemble and pack these systems.  

# Assembling the Reserve System  

The following components are necessary to assemble the  harness and container to the ram-air reserve:  

1.	 The harness, container, and associated parts to include  the reserve pilot chute and free bag, reserve ripcord,  reserve steering toggles, reserve closing loop, and  RSL, if desired. 2.	 Reserve canopy. 3.	 AAD, if desired.  

Before progressing, the necessary tools must be available.  The packing manual should include a recommended tools  list. However, based on the rigger’s experience and packing  technique, the numbers and types of tools needed to pack  this system may vary.  Figure 5-69  shows the tools needed  to pack the following ram-air parachute assembly using the  technique described.  

![](images/d6bc647ed0ce42cad5e835bf18d079f0e8d08e36a496df37769d925826305e3f.jpg)  
Figure 5-69.  Ram-air canopy packing tools.  

Before starting, always count your tools and then follow the  assembly procedures listed below:  

1.	 Connect the canopy to the risers of the harness,  ensuring line continuity is correct. 2.	 Tighten the connector links and seal with a telltale mark. 3.	 If used, install and secure the connector link bumpers  per the canopy manufacturer’s instructions. 4.	 Route the control lines through the slider grommets  and guide rings on the rear of the riser. Fasten the  steering toggles in the required manner.  [Figure 5-70]  

![](images/7dcef8d91c1e54e128adabfe9df9626ceb546a44ffa7b048f31c2c15b2b5e2b5.jpg)  
Figure 5-70.  Tying toggles.  

5.	 Install the AAD, if desired, according to the  manufacturer’s instructions. 6.	 Install a closing loop of the correct type and length. 7.	 Attach the reserve free bag to the reserve pilot chute.  

The following steps should be used for packing this type of  parachute:  

1.	 Layout and setting up packing clamps. 2.	 Stacking and pleating the reserve canopy. 3.	 Setting the deployment brakes. 4.	 Folding the canopy. 5.	 Placing the canopy into the deployment bag and  stowing the lines. 6.	 Placing the bag into the container and closing the  container.  

Step 1. Layout and Setting Up Packing Clamps  

1.	 Anchor the risers at the connector links including the  steering lines.  [Figure 5-71] 2.	 Place packing weight on top of it.  

![](images/260f7b2225f24e4b332c22b2fdf841817db15a844c5750daa28028edb5c08032.jpg)  
Figure 5-71.  Anchor risers.  

3.	 Pull the slider down to the connector links. Make  sure the tapes face upward toward the canopy.  [Figure 5-72]  

![](images/9e833fc7ce2b0e36155e50729f397bd338fe030a4762bd282ec60a7c409f5d81.jpg)  
Figure 5-72.  Pull slider down.  

4.	 Lay the canopy on its right side. ( NOTE:  A mirror  image of the layout is permissible). 5.	 Flake the canopy so the top seams are even. Place a  clamp on the top of the canopy in line with each line  attachment point as in  Figure 5-73 .  

Step 2. Stacking and Pleating the Reserve Canopy NOTE:  The canopy stack should look like  Figure 5-74 .  

It is imperative that the rigger maintains control over the  packing process at all times. In particular, it is important to  keep the lines taut and straight and to keep the center wind  channel of the canopy stack clear and the line attachment  tabs stacked neatly.

Step 4. Folding the Canopy  

1.	 Fold all the trailing edge to one side, then pull the  stabilizer panel taut.  [Figure 5-86] 2.	 Flake the trailing edge of the canopy starting with  the outboard control lines. Fold each cell in half on  top of the “D” line group until you get to the center.  [Figure 5-87] 3.	 Repeat with the opposite side. 4.	 Pull the slider up to the slider stops. 5.	 Remove remaining clamps from top of canopy. Make  sure all suspension lines are in the center of the canopy  stack.  [Figure 5-88] 6.	 Fold the center of the trailing edge back to expose the  center of the wind channel.  [Figure 5-89] 7.	 Create an “S” fold in the stack.  [Figure 5-90] 8.	 Position a packing paddle a third of the way up from  the bottom of the canopy length on top of the stack.  [Figure 5-91]

11.	 Close the bottom flap (#3) and secure with a temporary  pin.  [Figure 5-112]   NOTE:  At this point, you should  only be able to pull  $\mathbb{V}_{4-}\mathbb{V}_{2}$   inch of loop through the first  three flaps. If you can pull more, the loop is too long.  Open container and shorten loop.  

12.	 Close flap   $\#4$   and insert the ripcord pin.  [Figure 5-113]  CAUTION: Place the closing plate on  the bottom edge of the inner top flap. This protects the  plastic stiffener if you are kneeling on the pin protector  flap. The rigger should determine how tight the closing  loop is and decide whether to perform a pull test.  

Warning: Maximum allowable pull force on the  reserve ripcord is 22 pounds   $(10\,\mathrm{kg})$  .  

13.	 Once you are satisfied that the pull force is less than 22  pounds   $(10\,\mathrm{kg})$  , seal the ripcord and log the pack job.  

14.	 Place the data card in the data card pocket.  [Figure 5-114]

 15.	 Count your tools.

# Ram-Air Reserve into a Two-Pin Piggyback  

Many sport, military, and pilot emergency rigs feature the  two pin, externally-mounted reserve pilot chute or Pop- Top. The Pop-Top closes use adjustable closing loops that  are tightened after the pins are inserted. The following  instructions demonstrate the PRO pack method without the  use of clamps.  [Figures 5-115  through  5-165]

# Documentation  

One of the most important parts of the packing process is the  requirement to keep proper records. 14 CFR part 65, section  65.131, specifies the information the rigger is required to  document. There are two forms of required records. The  first is the rigger’s logbook. While the exact format is up  to the rigger, there are commercially-produced logbooks  

![](images/5c10bbabb6b756b4c1c9f7f4284d5528391fe351e87797ebc213586c57124be3.jpg)

There are several items of interest regarding the parachute  data card. In the past, the data cards usually had information  only for the identity of the parachute canopy, which is the  primary component of the assembly. In recent years, with  the growth of sport parachuting, this configuration is no  longer standard. With the proliferation of many makes and  models of canopies, harness, and containers, and the ability  to interchange components, it is necessary to document the  harness and container as well. The data card shown in Chapter  

![](images/17dc043a06c58eba03a82743c98310e1d25e3d6125bed2626557bdc3cf9f517a.jpg)

Figure 5-131.  Two packing paddles can be used to make a neat  S-fold.  

1,  Figure 1-8  has multiple identification spaces. With the  widespread use of AADs, it has now become necessary to  document the information required by the manufacturer such  as the service cycle and battery life. The newest cards have  provisions for this information.  

With the ability to interchange components, what does  the rigger do when a reserve canopy is removed from an  assembly? Where does the data card go? This is a somewhat  gray area, but the common practice is for the card to remain  with the canopy. If the harness and container have had work

done that requires documentation, it may be necessary for  the rigger to fill out a duplicate card with the appropriate  notations as to the work done on the harness. Riggers should  make sure that they note that this card is a copy of the original.  

![](images/40047370db954db05114523977e08074b16a890aec9fa140b953fba6d1545a51.jpg)  
Figure 5-135.  Inside the Reserve Speed Bag the buffer tabs form a  clear channel for the bottom closing loop.  

Finally, riggers are tasked with noting their name and  certificate number on the data card. In many cases, this  information is illegible. Riggers who take pride and  responsibility in their profession and the work they do have  no hesitation in letting the public know who did the work.  Accordingly, many riggers have a permanent ink stamp with  their name, certificate number, and seal symbol that they use  to stamp the card and then countersign it. This is the mark  of a truly professional rigger. While the seal symbol is not  required on the data card, it allows anyone to check the  signature against the seal on the parachute.  

# Chapter Summary  

It is the responsibility of the attending rigger to ensure  that the components of the approved parachute system are  compatible in terms of shock load capability. This may be  as simple as reading and comparing the TSO/Data Label  that is permanently attached to the reserve canopy and the  harness. This information may also be found in the respective

# Chapter 6 Hand Tools, Sewing  Machines, and the  Parachute Loft  

# Introduction  

Riggers are taught that there are three things necessary to do  a proper job: knowledge to do the work, the correct materials,  and the right tools. The job cannot be done correctly without  all three of these essentials. The right tools include various  types of sewing machines, as well as a wide variety of  specialized hand tools.  

The importance of learning the names and nomenclature  of rigging tools and equipment cannot be overemphasized.  Just as learning the language of a foreign country allows an  individual to live and operate efficiently within a society,  learning the language of the rigger allows new riggers to  operate and interact within their profession. Without the  necessary vocabulary, a rigger is not able to work with other  riggers and, more importantly, does not present a professional  image to customers. For example, when shopping for tools  or sewing machines for rigging, the same tool may have a  different name when used by some other trade. Knowing the  language of the rigger helps avoid confusion.  

![](images/2154d87bf18725c87e730e4b8a963916a67c92c54c09997b9de4eaa2cc4ed3ea.jpg)  

# Hand Tools  

A new senior rigger must acquire enough tools to pack and  maintain the types of parachutes for which he or she is rated.  In the course of training, the rigger candidate is exposed to  various tools and individual rigging techniques. Some riggers  adhere to a minimalist philosophy and use as few tools as  necessary. This may initially consist of a packing paddle, a  pull-up cord, and a temporary locking pin, or just a pull-up  cord, when packing main parachutes at the drop zone (DZ).  With some types of parachutes, these may be all the tools  needed to pack them. Other riggers develop techniques that  utilize an array of tools designed to make the job easier or  the end result neater. Some manufacturers have designed  specialized tools to make their particular parachute easier to  pack and maintain. Each rigger develops a suitable technique  and then obtains the tools to support it.  

In the past, the list of tools needed to pack and maintain  military surplus parachutes was limited. Since most military  parachutes were simply variants of the same canopy designs,  common tools could be used across the board. In today’s  high-tech world, some of these original tools are still used  along with a number of newer designs. Many riggers and  manufacturers design and build tools to fit a need, whether  it is a new rig design or to make a job more productive.  

All riggers need to create a tool kit tailored for their particular  situation.  Figure 6-1  shows a commercially-available field  rigger kitbag with tools. Although commercially-made  kitbags are nice, they are expensive. Many riggers are  “weekend” riggers, meaning they have a regular job during  the week and work as a rigger on the weekend. This is typical  of many skydiving riggers. Other riggers work full time in a  loft or manufacturing environment.  

![](images/6247f143c358b88b6f7ac1e0c4a78a8e90d56ce594a85ab366afda74fecdcade.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.  Field rigger kitbag with tools.  

Depending on their needs, riggers have different approaches  toward their tools. The weekend rigger may travel to a DZ  where the primary job is packing. Therefore, the tool kit is  more basic as the purpose of this kit is not to take the whole  loft to the DZ. The rigger who works in a full-time loft may  have a more comprehensive tool kit, since it does not have to  be hauled around. For the weekend rigger, there are several  field rigger kitbags available commercially that hold a full  assortment of tools. Many riggers design and build custom  kitbags tailored around their individual requirements. Doing  this is an excellent way to show off sewing skills, while  at the same time creating a needed tool kit. There are also  contractor tool bags made of a strong fabric with many  pockets and compartments that work well with the type  of tools a rigger uses. These bags are inexpensive and are  available at hardware and home improvement stores.  

To stock the tool kit, the rigger must determine what tools he  needs. This depends on where the tools are used: in the field,  DZ, or in the loft.  Figure 6-2  shows a list of necessary tools  that have been proven useful for today’s rigger. The list of  tools is broken down into two different categories: Category  1, items 6-3 through 6-49 are mandatory tools; Category 2,  items 6-50 through 6-56 are optional tools as most of them  are for use in the loft.  

# Hand Tools Description  

The tool belt is one of the most useful items the rigger can  have.  [Figure 6-3]  Most tool belts are custom built by the  riggers themselves and include a selection of tools that are  frequently used around the loft. It always seems that the tool  the rigger needs at a particular moment is at the other end of  the packing table or on another sewing machine. The use of a  tool belt makes riggers more efficient as they are not always  looking for and having to retrieve their tools. A well-designed  tool belt holds the following tools as a minimum: scissors,  thread snips, 6-inch ruler, marking pencils and pens, butane  cigarette lighter, seam ripper, Exacto ®  knife or scalpel, short  packing fid, and finger-trapping needles. Other tools can be  added according to the needs of the individual rigger. The  following is a list of common tools and a brief description  of how they are used.  

Seam ripper—used in the sewing industry for “picking”  stitches and ripping out seams. It has a pointed sharp end and  an inside cutting edge for slicing through thread.  [Figure 6-4]  

Hemostats or clamp—used by riggers for many clamping or  retrieving operations. Two or three sizes should be obtained,  as well as both straight and curved models. These tools can  be found at hardware or auto parts stores.  [Figure 6-5]  

Scalpel or Exacto ®  knife—used for delicate cutting of  materials or thread. The Exacto ®  knife is preferred as the  handles come in various sizes and with a wide selection of  blades.  [Figure 6-6]

Figure 6-5.  Hemostats or clamps.  

Thread snips—used in the sewing industry for trimming or  “snipping” thread when sewing. Handier and easier to use  than scissors as the point is finer and allows more precise  cutting of the thread. The ergonomic design takes some  getting used to but proves superior in the long term. The  stainless steel models are best, but some riggers prefer the  plastic ones that have replaceable blades.  [Figure 6-7]

Figure 6-7.  Thread snips.  

Butane cigarette lighter—used for burning thread ends to seal  the thread and keep stitches from raveling. It is also used for  searing tapes, lines, and light webbing. One of these should  be at each sewing machine or work site so the rigger does  not have to leave the work to find one.  [Figure 6-8]  

![](images/3c118cf43f26c4d13e433b8d308258e3bfbaffe29a43f6f4bc85bf11c11a5c1e.jpg)  
Figure 6-8.  Butane cigarette lighter.  

6-inch stainless steel rule—used for making fine measurements  during work. At a minimum, the scale should read to  $\mathbb{V}_{16}$   inch  and have a dual (English/metric) readout. Certain models  have one rounded end. This model can be used for removing  cut stitches from work by rubbing the rounded end against  the thread thereby lifting it and making it easier to remove.  [Figure 6-9]  

Fabric marking pencils and felt tip markers—used for  marking webbing, tapes, and fabric. The Dixon  $\#134{\mathrm{s}}$   was  used in the parachute industry for decades but is no longer  available. The Dixon China Marker is now used by many  riggers, as it contains no acid, and they come in 12 colors.  Other types have been found to contain abrasives and

compounds that, when used on canopy fabric, weaken the  material. This particular brand of pencil has been found to  have minimal effect on the fabric. Various colors, such as  white, yellow, and red, are useful. Fine point felt tip markers  are used for marking certain materials, such as Dacron ®  or  Spectra ®  line. Black, red, and blue are most common. Felt tip  pens, such as Sharpie ®  and Pilot ®  ultra- fine point permanent  type, are used by many riggers.  [Figure 6-10]

Figure 6-10.  Pencils and felt markers.  

Scissors—used for cutting all types of materials used in the  parachute industry. A high-quality scissor is lightweight,  ergonomic, and comes in right-hand and left-hand models.  Also, a short 5-inch barber shear is very sharp even when  “used” and works very well in cutting Cypres loop cord and  other line material commonly used in parachute rigging.  [Figure 6-11]  

Finger-trapping needle—used for inserting suspension  line into a “finger-trap” configuration. It is a heavy-duty  threaded needle commonly called a “fid,” not to be confused  with a “packing fid” or “paddle.” Plastic ones are available  commercially, but the best ones are custom made from  stainless steel or aluminum knitting needles. Cut to length,  they are then drilled and tapped with screw threads in the  flat end. The size 2, 6, and 8 needles are the most popular  for the current line sizes. A blunt end needle is also used to  finger trap Cypres loop cord.  [Figure 6-12]

Finger-trapping wire—used to finger trap line too small to  use a needle on. It is made from a wooden or plastic dowel  with a wire loop made from safety wire.  [Figure 6-13]  

![](images/4021373a6de06878f2f26009971dd4cd1224cc59328267b453838aa3a044a8f0.jpg)  
Figure 6-13.  Finger-trapping wire.  

Packing paddle—used for dressing the pack of the parachute  when packing. This tool is made from either wood or  aluminum. The MIL-SPEC paddle has rounded ends and  is   $1\ \%\"\times12\"$   long and tapers in thickness from   $\%"$   to 

  $\mathrm{\mathcal{V}_{16}"}$  . The wooden commercial paddle is   $1\%\times15"$   long. 

 [Figure 6-14A]

Figure 6-14.  Packing paddles and packing fid.  

Packing fid—similar to the packing paddle, used also for  dressing the parachute pack and tucking in flaps. The fid is  approximately   $1\%"\times8"$   long and tapers from  $\%"$   to  $\%"$  . It  is made from aluminum and was originally a United States  Navy tool. Many riggers have both the fid and the paddle,  but usually develop a preference for one or the other.  [Figure 6-14B]  

Pull-up cords—used to “pull-up” the locking loop of  parachute containers when closing and pinning them. They  are made from lengths of suspension line: Cypres loop cord  or Type-3 tape.  [Figure 6-15]

Figure 6-15.  Pull-up cords.  

Locking pull-up cord—used to lock the thickness of a two- grommet reserve deployment bag when packing the reserve  canopy. It is made from 72 inches of red Type-3 suspension  line and a size 94 Cordlok nylon fastener. It may be used on  one-pin or two-pin reserve bags.  [Figure 6-16]  

Molar strap—used to control the folded reserve canopy prior  to inserting it in the reserve free bag made from Type-8  webbing and a Camlok nylon buckle. The webbing should  be at least   $48"$   long and brightly colored to serve as a flag  against leaving it on the canopy.  [Figure 6-17]

Closing plate—used for closing one-pin containers. Made  from  $\%"$   aluminum with a “V” shaped notch for pulling the  closing loop up through the pack flaps while compressing  the container.  [Figures 6-20]  

![](images/9b192ec80aa3a8f91a86d2a03d5943fe4e097f952326b128306ef2a329d427e6.jpg)  
Figure 6-20.  Closing plate.  

T-bar positive leverage device—used to produce a “cranking”  action to wind up the pull-up cord, thereby increasing  leverage when closing the container. It must be used  carefully as it is possible that too much force can be applied,  damaging the container or creating too much force on the  pin.  [Figure  $_{6-2l\;A}$    and  $B J$  

T-handle bodkin—used primarily for closing container systems  that have external pilot chutes, such as the Jump Shack Racer.  A minimum of two is needed for the tool kit.  [Figure 6-22]  

Pilot chute threading tool—used for threading the pull-up  cord through a one-pin pilot chute. A .22 caliber gun-cleaning  rod works well. The best is a United States military surplus  M-16 cleaning rod. It is made from steel, as opposed to  aluminum, and breaks down into sections and a package that  is   $8"$   long.  [Figure 6-23]  

Pilot chute locking rod and strap-locking rod and strap used to  compress pilot chutes and used to hold the reserve pilot chute,  such as an MA-1 compressed on the pilot chute launching  disc. It is a tempered steel rod approximately   $18"\times\sqrt[3]{_{16}"}$  .  [Figure 6-24]  

![](images/73f1bc0d6478d5cfe045d28b66e154e89f71d044f0fd12324f22ebe178d11434.jpg)

Connector link separator tool—used to separate military style  connector links, such as MS-22002 and MS-70118. The tool  is Mil Spec PN 11-1-176.  [Figure 6-26]  

Shot bags—used to hold the canopy and suspension lines in  place while folding. Packing weight made from nylon fabric  and filled with lead shot for weight. These should be brightly  colored or have a flag attached to prevent leaving in the  parachute. Weight varies from 2–5 pounds according to needs.  A minimum of four is needed. Making shot bags provides an  excellent sewing project for the rigger candidate.  [Figure 6-27]  

Seal press—used for compressing lead seals when sealing the  parachute under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  14 (CFR) part 65, section 65.133. The die of the press has  the rigger’s seal symbol engraved in the face for identifying  the seal.  [Figure 6-28]

Lead seals and seal thread— used with the seal press to seal  the parachute, usually  $\%'$  " diameter. The thread is used to seal  the parachute in accordance with 14 CFR part 65, section  65.133. A cotton thread, usually ticket 20/4 with a tensile  strength of 4.7 pounds; also used as safety tie where required.  Due to the fact that seal thread is only available in 100-pound  lots, some manufacturers buy it and then put it up on smaller  spools and make it available to riggers.  [Figure 6-29]  

Rigger’s logbook—used by riggers to meet the recordkeeping  requirements of 14 CFR part 65, section 65.131.  [Figure 6-30]

Packing data card—used to fulfill the recordkeeping  requirements of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   part 65, section 65.131(c) that is  normally made of Ty-  $\mathrm{V}\mathbf{e}\mathbf{k}^{\mathfrak{G}}$   material and is kept with the  parachute. Ty-  $\cdot\mathbf{V}\mathbf{e}\mathbf{k}^{\circledast}$   is difficult to write on with a ball point  pen. One pen that works very well is the “Pilot ultra-fine  point NO XYLENE - permanent type SCA-UF.” This pen can  be found at office supply stores, although you may have to  order them. They come in black, red, and blue.  [Figure 6-31]  

Note pad—used for recording miscellaneous information or  making sketches when working on parachutes.  [Figure 6-32]  

Rubber bands—used for stowing suspension lines, bridles,  or static lines. Three sizes are common today. Besides the  normal 2-inch size, there is a smaller 1-inch size for the  newer microline and a larger one used for tandem parachutes.  Tube Stoes ®  used in place of rubber bands are required by  some manufacturers, such as Butler Parachute Systems, Inc.  [Figure 6-33]

Figure 6-35.  Straight and T pins.  

Navy end tab—used for assisting in hand tacking thick  materials. This is a container end tab from a United States  Navy seat pack modified with a “dimple.” The dimple  allows the needle to be pushed through the material, and the  holes in the tab allow gripping the needle to pull it through.  [Figure 6-36]  

Waxed nylon “supertack”—used for hand tacking  requirements because it has superior knot holding properties.  It is a waxed, flat, braided nylon cord that serves as a modern  replacement for 6-cord nylon. Typically 80 – 90 pounds  tensile strength, a 50-pound version is also available. This  cord is available in black and white.  [Figure 6-37]  

Hand tacking needles—variety of sizes of straight and curved  needles used for general sewing are necessary for every tool  kit.  [Figure 6-34]

Figure 6-37.  Waxed nylon “supertack.”  

3-cord cotton thread–waxed—used for hand tacking and  break tacking on the risers and connector links of emergency  parachutes. Its tensile strength is 16 pounds. The color is  usually natural.  [Figure 6-38]  

Tape measure—used for general measurement of items  such as suspension lines and bridles. A good quality tape  measure at least 25 feet long is necessary. A quality fabric  tape measure is also necessary. If possible, get one with dual  measurements (English/metric).  [Figure 6-39]  

Shoulder strap hook—packing assist device used to apply  tension to the pull-up cord using upper-body strength thereby

freeing both hands to pin the container. This strap can be built  by the rigger.  [Figure 6-40]  

Pony clamps—used for clamping material to hold it as a third  hand. Also used as a packing assistant when packing square  reserves. These do come in handy, although not used by all  riggers.  [Figure 6-41]  

6-inch adjustable wrench—used for tightening Rapide ®  links  and other jobs. A good adjustable wrench serves in place of  

![](images/bf64d63e46a69b0ef969ce63412642a00c46384c19ef0d247b9040da6809012b.jpg)

Figure 6-42.  6-inch adjustable wrench.  

Screwdriver–multi-tip—used for L-bar connector links and  general use. A good quality screwdriver with interchangeable  tips is the most versatile model. Good quality cannot be  stressed enough. If the tip of the screwdriver does not fit the  slot in the screw of a L-bar connector properly, it can slip  out and can cause damage to the screw head or injury to the  rigger.  [Figure 6-43]

Figure 6-44.  Needle-nose pliers.  

Cable cutters—used for cutting stainless steel cable and  trimming the 3-ring release cable to length. A good quality  cable cutter, such as the Felco ™  model C7, cuts the cable  cleanly. Electrician’s pliers or diagonal cutters flatten the  ends of the wire unless they are of high quality and sharp.  [Figure 6-45]

Figure 6-47.  Beeswax.  

Spring scale and fabric testing clamps—used for measuring  the ripcord pull force on reserve and emergency parachutes.  With a minimum rating of 50 pounds, it is also used in  conjunction with the fabric testing clamps to measure fabric  strength on reserve canopies in accordance with Parachute  Industry Association (PIA) TS-108. Some riggers do not use  testing clamps as they can cause damage to good fabric, if  not used properly.  [Figure 6-48]

Hot knife element with cutting tip, basting tip, and stand— used for cutting and searing synthetic materials, such as  nylon, Dacron ® , and Spectra ® . The basting tip is used for  fusing canopy material in place prior to sewing during canopy  repairs. The stand is necessary to keep the hot elements from  causing a fire. A heavy-duty hot knife, although expensive,  is a must have for any serious rigger.  [Figure  $6–49\,A$    and  $B J$  

Hot glue gun—used to replace staples and hand basting in  harness work. This modern tool has changed harness repair  and construction techniques.  [Figure 6-50]  

Tension board assembly with apex tiedown—used on the  round packing table to apply tension to the canopy when  packing. There are two models available. One is for military  style L-bar connector links and another, smaller one for  Rapide ®  style connector links. The straps should have a  quick release feature to release tension easily.

Stimpson Co., Inc. is the most useful grommet set because it  has a replaceable die insert section, that wears out in time and  can be replaced. It is also the highest quality. The stainless  steel set works for both brass and stainless steel grommets.  For the rigger who does not replace as many stainless  grommets, the hand set from Lord and Hodge size “0” will  also set stainless steel spur grommets, but does not last as long  as the commercial handset. The other sizes most often used  are “3” and “5” to set brass or nickel plated.  [Figure 6-52]  

Hole punches—used for punching holes for grommets that  come in various-sizes. Most often sizes used would be 0, 3,  and 5. [ Figure 6-53]  

Cutting pad—used with hole punches. The best are plastic  as these do not damage the punch.  [Figure 6-54]  

Rawhide mallet—used when punching holes and using  grommet handsets. This is a preferred tool to use as the  rawhide does not damage the other tools, and the weight  makes the job easier and more consistent. The number 2 size

The above tools provide the rigger with the means to pack  and maintain most of the common parachutes in use today.  There are numerous other tools, both old and new, that  individuals may wish to acquire for specialized parachutes  shown in  Figure 6-57 . In particular, there are older style  parachutes and military parachutes that cannot be packed  without specialized tools designed specifically for them. At  the same time, the profession is constantly developing new  tools to make the job easier.  

# Sewing Machines  

After the senior rigger has put together a personal tool kit,  the next step is to acquire a selection of sewing machines in  order to do minor repairs of defects found during inspection  prior to packing. For example, if you find a small hole in the  canopy, a sewing machine is necessary to make the correct  repair. For this, a lightweight single needle machine is the  perfect beginning. As your sewing skills progress, additional  specialized machines can be added as space and finances  allow. Always remember, only those repairs allowed under  your certificate may be performed.  

![](images/3a6ee450351e30c91c2bd821a4aca644cf4f42d8d885aaa07ea07bd2566cff2f.jpg)  
Figure 6-57.  (A) link fork, (B) pull check tool, (C) tool used to maintain continuity of risers when removing main parachute from harness,  and (D) Pro Pack hook.  

When purchasing a new sewing machine, if money allows,  buy the best and newest machines affordable. Do not avoid  old machines because if they are not worn out and parts  are available, they can be a good buy. If worn out, they are  counterproductive. Buy self-lubricating machines as opposed  to ones you need to oil manually. It is preferable to get  machines with a reverse mechanism. Get an adjustable “K  leg” stand and table. This allows you to set the height of the  table to best fit your physical needs. Large people bending  over a short table for any length of time understand the need  for this feature. If the rigger is buying a new machine, it is  possible to order an oversize table top in place of the standard   $20"\times48"$   size. This allows better control over harness and  containers so they do not overlap the table.  

When buying any machine, particularly from a sewing machine  dealer, get the operator’s manual and the parts manual for the  machine. The operator’s manual tells you how to set up and  operate the machine and is indispensable when the need to  order parts arises. Manuals for older machines can be found  online, along with parts manuals. When shopping for used or  older machines, seek out reputable companies or individuals  that used the machine for business, such as retiring parachute  riggers, or upholstery shops, leather shops, etc. Whenever  possible, it is always best to try the machine before you buy it.  

Experience has shown that the average rigger who wishes  to set up a loft needs three initial machines: a lightweight  single needle, such as a Singer 31-15 or Mitsubishi DB-130,  for canopy repair and lightweight maintenance; a double  needle, such as a Singer 212W140 or Mitsubishi LT2-220,  with a binder or taping attachment for binding material and  light manufacture; and a medium-duty double throw (308)  zigzag machine, such as a Bernina Model 217, for suspension  line repair and replacement.  [Figures 6-58, 6-59, and 6-60]  

![](images/ae66b79221de502440b61e95f194b603aaa1cf22a5eba11f519fb327734af390.jpg)  
Figure 6-58.  Mitsubishi DB-130.  

For individuals on a tight budget or with space constraints,  a good idea is to buy a double-needle machine first. By  removing one needle and bobbin, the machine performs  excellently as a single-needle machine. Replace the needle  

![](images/32b70a688b6521b75ea076508a9185a68d45864dee7f9d6fd50df76a0d7ea7ac.jpg)

and bobbin, and the machine again is a double needle. This  gives the rigger two machines for the price and space of one.  A good zigzag machine also does multiple-duty. Its primary  purpose is for zigzag sewing. However, adjusting the stitch  regulator allows the rigger to do an acceptable job sewing bar  tacks. By changing the stitch length and adjusting the width  to the narrowest setting, some machines do good straight  stitching, such as the Pfaff model 138.  

An excellent machine for canopy patch work is an old Singer  model 201-2 made in the 1950s. Because this machine was  made for home use, they can be often be found in good working  condition. The Singer model 201-2 is unique in that it takes up  to a size 21 needle and is all gear driven with no belts. Another  portable machine, which is very handy, is the Consew CP- 146R Mini Walking Foot.  [Figure 6-61]  It sews a 301 straight  or 304 zigzag stitch and sews through thicker material. Both  sewing machines are good choices for traveling to the DZ.  

Any machine used in parachute rigging must be capable of  using at least a size 18 needle to handle size E (69) thread. E  thread is used in most sewing done by a senior rigger.  

![](images/28114e4137b33c891bfa97d5e460d8ca7b6c268692da8212939d5f5de44fc88c.jpg)  
Figure 6-61.  Consew model CP-146R Mini Walking Foot.  

The double needle machine is preferable for binding tape  repair, although with experience a rigger can install TY-3  tape with a single needle machine making two passes. When  using this method, a tape folder must be used, and the inner  stitch must be done first.  

Advancing to master rigger requires additional specialized  machines, such as a medium-duty, single needle, and  compound feed machine, like a Consew 226R or a Juki LU- 563.  [Figure 6-62]  The Consew 206RB is also a good choice  for those on a budget. This type of machine is used for doing  container repairs and light harness work.  [Figure 6-63]  The  next machine should be a heavy-duty harness machine, such  as a Singer 7-33, 7-34, or Consew 733R.  [Figure 6-64]  These  machines specialize in sewing 5-cord nylon or heavier thread  used in the manufacture and repair of parachute harnesses.  

Lastly, a bar tack machine, such as a Pfaff 3334 or Singer  69 class, allows fast, strong, professional repairs and  is invaluable in line replacement and manufacturing.  [Figure 6-65]  This selection of machines provides the  rigger with the ability to undertake virtually any repair or  modification needed on today’s parachutes. Remember, all

sewing machine manufacturers build models that fit within  the various duty types. Those models mentioned are only  representative for that category.  [Figure 6-66]  

# Identification and Nomenclature  

The purpose of the following information is not to make  you an accomplished sewing machine expert and repairman.  You should learn the basics about what makes your sewing  machines work and how to perform routine maintenance

# Sewing Theory  

Once the rigger has become familiar with the parts of the  machine, it is time to begin to understand the operation and  theory of how the machines sew. The primary form of stitch  pattern is called a 301 lockstitch. It is formed by two threads,  one from the top and one from the bottom. The needle carries  the thread from the top through the material, and the bobbin  holds the thread on the bottom. The hook catches a small  loop in the upper thread and carries it around the bobbin,  and the two threads interlock between themselves to form  the stitch.  Figures 6-69  through  6-73  show the sequence in  forming the stitch.  

There are two types of principles of operation in sewing  machines: the “oscillating” hook and the “rotary” hook.  With the oscillating type, the bobbin and hook are  positioned in a vertical plane to the bed of the machine. The  hook rocks back and forth in a half revolution to complete  the stitch. With the rotary type, the bobbin and hook may  be either vertical or horizontal, and the hook makes two  

![](images/fdcb728f358b578a38fdabfab599ff5bc0b19a2671e5b60f0040f9e60437d0c1.jpg)

complete revolutions to complete one stitch. The oscillating  models are generally slower in operation while the rotary  is the high-speed model. Aside from the larger, heavy-duty  machines, most new machines are rotary in operation.  [Figures 6-74 and 6-75]  

![](images/2233debd40ddb5e419a53aadbca69db243f81d8188acdaa909f5ae37846506f1.jpg)  
Figure 6-70.  Second step in forming a stitch.  

There are three types of feed mechanisms to move material  through the machines. The first and simplest is called a  “drop feed” machine. With this type of feed, a feed dog on  the bottom rises up to press the material against the presser  foot from the top and moves it along while the needle bar  

![](images/a2d0796c9beb893e055d25613466d5fccd1865f4cf449678ab9ca2cc4b4c007e.jpg)

and needle move up and down penetrating the material and  forming the stitch. This is generally the lightest duty of  machines. The Singer 31-15 and Mitsubishi DB-130 are two  examples of a drop feed.  

![](images/0eecea6965590c21c0771acb228cced65a6a077c1132848300ca01174d324640.jpg)

Figure 6-75.  Rotary hook.  

The second type of machine is the “needle feed” machine.  With this type, the needle bar moves in addition to the feed dog  and helps move the material. This is a medium-duty machine.  The Brother B-791 is an example of a “needle feed” machine.  

The third type of machine is a “compound feed” machine.  This is a combination of the drop feed and needle feed along  with an alternating presser foot. This is a more positive feed  machine and is generally a medium-duty to heavy-duty  machine. The Juki LU-563 and Consew 733R are good  examples of “compound feed” machines.  

# Needles  

The needle is one of the smallest parts of the machine but is  probably the most important. It is the source of the perfect  stitch and also the most aggravation. The use of the correct  type and size of needle is most important in proper operation  of a sewing machine. Improper needles cause a machine to  produce poor stitching and may damage the material, or the  machine might not sew at all. Using the wrong needle can  also damage the machine.  [Figure 6-76]  Without getting into  the advanced aspects of needle technology, there are a few  simple things for the rigger to know.  

1.	 There are three types of points—round, diamond, and  twist. Round is used for cloth as it separates the fibers  of the cloth as it passes through. The diamond is used  for leather as it cuts the material. 2.	 Each type of needle has a number to identify its size. A  typical description would be   $\overbrace{\mathbf{\Omega}^{*}\mathbf{1}6}\times\mathbf{9}5$  , size 20.” The 16  is the size or diameter of the shank. The 95 is the length  and also describes the type of point. Odd numbers  denote round points and even denotes diamond points.  The size 20 is the diameter of the shaft. 3.	 The rigger should always follow the instructions in the  operator’s manual for the proper needle, installation,  and threading.  

![](images/f561f4461d483e234e6b0dd8daf36ae4d6643825ba0e707d828f460da1a75420.jpg)  
Figure 6-76.  Parts of a needle.  

# Operation  

Each sewing machine is unique and comes with a detailed  operator’s manual that explains step-by-step the procedures  for sewing. Listed below are some common steps that can  be used and are applicable to most machines.  

•	 Before you first sit down in front of the machine, check  to see that the power cord is plugged in.  •	 Many of the modern machines are self-lubricating and  have an oil reservoir in a pan below the head. Make sure  there is oil of the correct type and to the correct level. •	 Next, remove the bobbin case and bobbin from the  machine and the upper thread from the needle. This  allows you to check to see if the bobbin case is clear  and free in operation. •	 Without turning the power on, depress the treadle  lightly to release the clutch. Turn the balance wheel or  drive pulley toward you, and cycle the needle up and  

down several times to see if the machine turns freely.  Listen for any sounds that seem abnormal and notice  

any feeling of tightness or binding of the machine. •	 If everything seems normal, re-thread the needle. Take  a full bobbin, place it in the bobbin case, and install it  in the shuttle of the machine.  [Figures 6-77  and   6-78] •	 Cycle the needle down and pick up the bobbin thread.  A correctly threaded and timed machine picks up the  bobbin thread on the first cycle.

# Installing the Needle and Threading the Machine  

Most single-needle-type machines have the needle positioned  in the needle bar with the long thread groove facing to the  left. It is important to always check the threading diagram  to make sure the needle is installed correctly and ensure that  the needle is installed all the way up to the stop in the needle  groove of the needle bar. Check that the long thread groove  faces in the direction for that type of machine and that the  needle clamp screw is tight.  [Figure 6-79]  

![](images/1121c5fec89231d81f33ebf719c712ccf949de4bac0164992ac9aea233622fc1.jpg)  
Figure 6-79.  Needle with left orientation.  

Examples of single-needle machines where the thread groove  does not face left are Singer 17W15 308-stitch or Singer 69  bar tack. The thread groove most often faces the bobbin, but  not always in the case of a Horizontal Rotary Hook, such as  Singer 201-2. Read the manual, if the needle does not pick  up the bobbin thread, it may not be installed correctly.  

Take a cone of thread and place it on the thread stand. Route  the thread upward through the guide at the top of the stand and  then to the pre-tension thread guide on top of the arm of the  machine.  [Figure 6-80]  Most modern machines use a similar  method of threading. However, there may be additional  thread guides of different shapes to route the thread through.  This is why the rigger should have a copy of the operator’s  manual for proper threading of each machine.  

Once the machine is threaded correctly, take a sample of  material suitable for the type of machine, thread, and needle.  Form several layers and place it under the presser foot. Lower  the presser foot while holding the upper and lower threads  securely to the rear of the presser foot. Turn the balance wheel  again and run a few stitches by hand to see if the machine  sews properly. If everything works as expected, turn the  power on and begin sewing. If you are unfamiliar with this  particular machine, begin slowly until you get the feel of the  clutch and speed of the machine. The harder you push, the  faster the machine runs. Some industrial machines are able to  run very fast. This can intimidate many. If you need to slow  the machine down, you can replace the pulley on the motor  with one smaller pulley. A parts and repair shop will have  or be able to order the pulley you need. Order the smallest  

![](images/8f022c0039b5037eb3a32a47e3a5d9efa7a609dd4c0387981d06bdec897eff2a.jpg)  
Figure 6-80.  Thread the machine.  

pulley that fits the shaft on your motor. You do have to know  the make and model of the machine.  

Another way to slow a machine is to replace the clutch  motor with a rheostat motor. They operate the same way as  a dimmer switch for a lamp. The operator sets the speed of  the motor, and it does not run faster than what it is set at.  When finished sewing, always place a piece of fabric under  the presser foot in order to keep the feed dogs from causing  damage to the presser foot.  

If the machine does not sew correctly, consult the troubleshooting  guide to determine what the problem is and how to remedy it.  [Figure 6-81]  If the machine jams, it is very important to not  force it, as you can cause damage to the machine.  

# Machine Maintenance  

The most important part of maintaining your sewing  machines is to keep them clean and lubricated. Each machine  should be wiped down daily with a clean rag to remove oil  and dirt. The amount of use each machine gets dictates the  cleaning required. However, on at least a weekly schedule, the  moving parts should be cleaned with a small brush to remove  dust, lint, dirt, and threads. An air hose or bottle is useful in  blowing dirt out of places the brush cannot reach. Be careful  when doing this as small particles can be propelled through  the air and can get into the eyes. At the very least, the dirt  can be blown onto other machines and work.  

After cleaning, each machine should be lubricated to  ensure smooth operation. For those machines that are self- lubricating, check the level and condition of the oil in the  reservoir. For these machines, a number 1 white oil that has  a higher viscosity should be used. Depending on the amount  of use, the oil should be changed every 6 months to a year.  In no case should the oil be changed less than once a year.  For machines that require manual lubrication, a number 2  white oil should be used as it has a lower viscosity to better  adhere to the moving parts. This should be done daily at the  end of the workday. Oiling the machine at this time allows  the oil to seep downward through the mechanisms and collect  on the bottom.  

In the morning before use, take a clean rag and wipe off the  excess oil so it does not stain the parachute materials. Pay  particular attention to the shuttle race. Keeping this well  lubricated ensures smooth operation and a quieter machine.  One item that tends to get overlooked is the bobbin winder.  The shaft of the winder has a small hole in the top and a drop  of oil should be added at least once a week to keep it free.

# Sewing Machine Attachments  

The most common attachment that the rigger uses is a tape  folder or “binder.” This attachment folds tape, typically  $\%.$  -  inch Type-3, used for binding the edges of container, bags,  or any material needing an edge binder. Used in conjunction  with a double-needle machine, it folds the tape in half for  a professional appearance and greatly speeds up the work.  [Figure 6-82]

Figure 6-82.  Material with binding tape.  

There are two types of folders. One is a straight folder where  the tape is fed straight into the machine under the presser foot.  [Figure 6-83]  This folder is used for most straight binding,  has minimal adjustments, and is the least expensive usually  costing around 35 dollars. The second type of folder is a  right angle folder.  [Figure 6-84]  The best models of these  are custom built by companies that specialize in attachments.  They utilize special feed dogs, throat plates, and presser feet  in addition to the folder. This type of folder is hinged to swing  out of the way for changing bobbins. Most machines have  several adjustments that allow for fine tuning the folder for  optimum performance depending on the tape used. Folders  can cost several hundred dollars.

Figure 6-84.  Right angle binder.  

Another type of attachment is used to feed reinforcing tape  such as  $\%$  -inch Type-3 onto a canopy seam. This is a simple  guide that is attached to the presser foot and feeds the tape  evenly to the needles. Yet another attachment is a seam folder  used to make a French fell seam in canopy construction.  Figure   $_{6-85}$   shows both of the above attachments used in  conjunction with each other. Over the years, the sewing  industry has developed literally hundreds of different  attachments to speed up and improve the sewing process.

# The Parachute Loft  

The term “loft” comes from earlier times when the area used  to pack and maintain parachutes was usually situated in the  aircraft hangar above the aircraft. Hence, the term“loft.” The  name has continued to this day and is synonymous with the  parachute workshop.  

Under, 14 CFR part 65, section 65.127(b), a rigger must  have: “Suitable housing that is adequately heated, lighted, and  ventilated for drying and airing parachutes.” Under 14 CFR  part 65, section 65.127(d), the rigger must have: “Adequate  housing facilities to perform his duties and to protect his  tools and equipment.” All of this only makes sense in that the  properties stipulated are those that are best suited for storing  and maintaining parachutes. Although these regulations have  been in effect for over 40 years and were originally intended  to apply to parachutes with organic fibers in them, they still  apply today. From the practical side, keeping yourself and the  parachute warm promotes efficient work habits. Good lighting  means that you can properly inspect the parachute. Good  ventilation allows the parachute to properly dry before packing.  

Most individuals have been to automotive garages where  there was oil on the floor and parts strewn everywhere. Yet  when the mechanic is finished with your car, the cost is fair  and your car runs like new. In contrast, modern professional  garages sometimes look like hospital facilities in their  cleanliness and organization, the cost is high, and your car  does not start after you pay the bill. Where would you take  your car? The loft, as depicted in  Figure 6-86 , is a dream  for most riggers who do there rigging in there basement as a  hobby. For the rigger who lives in a climate that is conducive  to year round work and plans to make rigging a full time  job, they may invest in a full-time loft. In colder climates,  it is busy in the summer, and in winter, well cold. A clean,  organized, and well-designed loft can inspire customer  confidence, but the rigger’s ability to work on the parachute  is all that matters when you need that canopy over your head. The loft facility houses the sewing machines and other  equipment over and above the hand tools that all riggers  should have. A full-service loft has the following areas:  

# Packing and Inspection Area  

A main part of the loft layout is a suitable packing area.  According to 14 CFR part 65, section 65.127(a), the rigger  must have: “A smooth top table at least 3 feet wide by 40  feet long.” Technically, this is still required and is used  primarily for round canopies. However, with today’s square  parachutes, the accepted practice is to pack on the floor on  a suitable covering, such as carpet. Squares can be packed  on a table, but there must be access to the canopy from both  sides of the table in order to inspect and fold it properly.  [Figure 6-87]  Even when packed on a table, the parachute  may have to be moved to the floor to aid in closing the  container. If the rigger is packing a round parachute, a  packing table is preferable as it makes the rigger’s job easier  and more comfortable. If there is no packing table, then there  needs to be an open area big enough to lay out the round or  square parachute. While not expressly required, most lofts  have a canopy hanger for inspection, airing, and assembling  square canopies.  [Figure 6-88]  Many riggers who do not  have the room to hang a canopy at home take the canopy to  the DZ where space is available. A square canopy can also  be aired by S folding and hanging it from a simple hook.  This way a square canopy can be aired in a small space, but  it is important to note that this technique is to air the canopy  out, not inspect it.  [Figure 6-89]

Figure 6-89.  A square canopy can also be aired by S folding and  hanging it from a simple hook.  

Along with the canopy hanger, an assembly and inspection  table is extremely useful.  [Figure 6-90]  It allows the  harness and container to be assembled to the canopy without  laying it on the floor. The assembly table allows the correct  distance from the floor to mate with the canopy and provides  an ideal storage area for the packing tools, wrenches,  other equipment, and materials needed for assembly.  [Figure 6-91]  This table can be a folding banquet table or  wheeled cart if space is limited.  

![](images/d74cc342f9521a7aadf4a6d7ce3505970bbf563f3cfc50d50c517bfcdf3724b5.jpg)

Figure 6-91.  Canopy and table layout.  

# Work Area Including Layout Tables and Sewing  Machines  

The work and layout tables are ideally  $4\times8$   feet for optimum  space usage. Any canopy layout can be done on the packing  table. The work tables should be adjacent to the sewing  machines for minimum walking distance between them.  Many lofts have a small table along the walls against which  the sewing machines are placed. This allows storage of  materials and other items needed during the sewing operation.  

The right end of the sewing machine table is placed against  this table so that the left, or open end, is available to lay  canopies or containers on.  

# Harness Table and Machines  

Because of the nature of harness work, there are many  specialized materials and tools unique to harness work. The  table houses the hot knife, hot glue gun, templates, and rulers.  [Figure 6-92]  The harness machine should be adjacent to the  harness table for maximum efficiency.  

![](images/a5e3c693e737a4855ddaf25a3c791e98e03b8ed53ccd17281da5c240be308eac.jpg)  
Figure 6-92.  Harness work table.  

# Cutting Table  

The cutting table is used for cutting canopy fabric for canopy  repairs, para-pak or Cordura ®  for container repairs, or for  cutting anything for general manufacturing. Ideally, this  cutting table has a glass surface for use with a hot knife. One  of the best designs utilizes a  $4\times4$   feet glass surface that is  hidden below a wooden cover that can be removed when  needed and protects the glass when not in use. This table  serves dual duty as a work table.  [Figure 6-93]  If space is  limited, a smaller piece of glass can be used. If available, use  a thick laminated piece of glass that is less prone to breaking.  

# Metal Working Area  

It is important to segregate the metal working area from the  rest of the loft because metal working creates considerable  contamination with metal shavings and other particles  injurious to parachute fabrics. The metal working area has  drills, grinders, swaging tools, Nicopress ®  tools, and other  tools needed for repairing or overhauling metal components.  [Figure 6-94]  The grommet area should be adjacent to  the metal working area, since several of the tools used  to remove grommets are found there.  [Figure 6-95]  The  grommet machine or handsets are kept in this area. Parachute  containers or other parts needing grommets are brought to  this area for work. A metal working cart with drawers for

Figure 6-94.  Metal working area.  

tools may be used, provided it is kept away from any fabric  that could be damaged.  

# Office Area  

The office area handles the administrative and record keeping  functions of the loft. It should have a desk, file cabinets,  library or bookshelves, telephone/fax machine, and computer.  All work orders are processed through here.  

![](images/49be9b3035a2a8b204053bfcb21beae625917b3b2cdcaa9d8975f28ac6209695.jpg)  
Figure 6-95.  Grommet area.  

# Materials Storage Area  

The storage area may be a separate room, a pegboard, or  cabinets on the walls where thread, tapes, and webbing are  stored.  [Figure 6-96]  Rolls of fabric may be stored under the  work or packing tables or on wall racks.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter contains information on the different types of  sewing machines, component parts and there function, stitch  formation, needles, and troubleshooting and hand tools used  while performing the work of senior and Master Parachute  Riggers. Having the correct tools for parachute rigging cannot  be over emphasized. When the rigger is brought a parachute  to be inspected, repaired, and repacked anything less than  the best is unacceptable. The customer trusts the rigger with  his life and no effort should be spared to provide the best.  

It takes time to accumulate all the tools available. With any  given task, the correct tools and space to perform the job is  a must. Most important is that the rigger has the knowledge  to do the work for which he or she is rated. The rigger must  also have access to information, such as parachute manuals,  manufactures contact information, and other riggers with  more experience.  

![](images/bf782c4f7a4d77d1472e9ab9c51c71591fadc4480cec71479d655deee3bc3f6a.jpg)  
Figure 6-96.  Thread storage area.  

All of the above may be practical for the full-time professional  loft, but for the individual rigger there may be certain space  constraints. Many riggers take over their garage or basement,  which makes a perfectly suitable loft with some cleaning  and remodeling.  

# Chapter 7 Repairs, Alterations, and  Manufacture  

# Introduction  

Inspection requirements are the mainstay of the parachute  rigger, but of equal importance is the repair and maintenance  of the parachute and its related systems. When the parachute  is new, it is expected to function as designed. As it is used  and ages, however, it begins to wear and its condition  changes, which over time could result in a malfunction of  the system. It is the rigger’s responsibility during inspections  to identify any condition that might result in the parachute  being considered non-airworthy and dangerous. In the course  of training, the rigger candidate learns to identify those  conditions that may be unsafe. The trainee also learns how  to undertake the necessary repairs to return the parachute to  its original, airworthy configuration. As we look at repairs  it becomes very evident that inspection is the initial part of  the process of any repair.  

![](images/6d1b98d5b3a0efd5f7b431082dd0dacea06a2127a34ff11f621fbbcc4de5767d.jpg)  

As stated in Chapter 1 of this handbook, Regulations and  Human Factors, it is imperative that riggers be able to  distinguish between minor and major repairs. This ensures  that riggers do not exceed the limitations of their certificate  or endanger the parachute user. The basic rule for repairs is  to return the damaged parachute or component to its original  airworthy configuration. However, in many instances, the  remanufacture of the parachute may not be practical or cost  effective. In these cases, there are approved repair techniques  riggers can use to return the parachute to service. These  techniques form an important part of the rigger’s store of  knowledge. To make a decision as to the confirmation for the  possible need for repairs, we must first understand the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) requirement of inspection.  

# Inspection Process  

Chapter 5 of this handbook, Inspection and Packing,  addresses the purpose of the 180-day cycle as required by  the FAA. This action insures that the approved/certificated  parachute assembly meets the standards and conditions for  safe return to service; it also become the cornerstone of the  maintenance and repair process.  

The confirmation of wear or damage is critical in the  determination of actions that may be needed as set forth in  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part  43 and key in the assessment of actions and clarity of the  repair that may need to be performed.  

As is the character of any device or object, use and physical  location conditions (heat, moisture, sand, dirt) over time  cause wear to an item and, on occasion, misuse or improper  actions during use result in damage. Certain parts or areas of  a device incur more wear or damage according to use, action  of handling, and contact with other components. Knowledge  of this aspect should require increased or location specific  consideration during the inspection process.  

This recognition possibility of high-wear components or areas  does not decrease or eliminate the inspection of any other  part of the parachute assembly. It only identifies that the wear  or damage probabilities are greater at these locations. These  areas are referred to as common wear or damage patterns  and apply to both round and square parachutes and parachute  assemblies. These types of common wear/damage pattern  applies in greater detail to the parachute that is utilized as  the main parachute and deployed on each jump in sport use.  

The inspection of a reserve canopy after deployment  should be very concise and complete. Much care should  be taken for a very thorough inspection of the parachute  and related components. Parachutes are manufactured in  two categories: approved (certificated) and non-approved  (non-certificated). All reserve emergency use parachutes  are approved (certificated) and are tested to FAA-required  Technical Standard Order (TSO) standards. They are used  and maintained by FAA standards (inspection and repaired  by FAA-cetificated rigger or the manufacturer) as airframe  and powerplant (A&P) mechanics are used.  

Non-approved or non-certificated parachutes are generally  main parachutes, and related components, which can be  packed, used, and repaired outside of FAA maintenance and  repair requirements. Rigger inspections and rigger repairs  are highly recommended but not required. Inspection of  and approved (certificated) parachute calls for inspection  of all related components, which are listed below. Related  components are parts of the parachute, deployment system,  harness, and container system, and any item that has  responsibility for containment, deployment, or operation of  an approved (certificated) parachute and are a critical part  of the assembly. They must be inspected for use the same as  the reserve parachute.  

•	 Deployment bag (freebag, safety stow) •	 Bridle and pilot chute  •	 Slider, slider fabric, and grommets  •	 Rapid links (soft links) •	 Rapid link covers (soft link covers) •	 All seams and seam fabric •	 Suspension lines and line attachments •	 Ripcord housing and attachments •	 Ripcord assembly •	 Upper and lower skins of canopy, all load and non-load  bearing ribs, all cross ports  

All of these areas can sustain wear or damage during normal  use. The event of use at very high speeds can be contributed  to the possibility of increased damage from exceeding the  maximum speed allowed during deployment.  

During inspection of certificated/approved parachutes,  it is advisable to map related damage found on a chart  which is shown in  Figure 7-1 . This chart can be used to  describe the location of needed repair to a customer, assist  in quickly locating the damage, and answer questions that  the manufacturer may have relating to possible repair.  [Figure 7-1]  

If a rigger were to receive a damaged sport main canopy for  repair, it would be advantageous to gain as much information  as possible as to the cause and situation that created the  damage. Inspection of the canopy should be as follows:

# Major or Minor Repairs  

It is an age-old question among rigging technicians, one  that is yet to receive a clear, understandable answer. The  distinction between a major repair and a minor repair is  clouded by regulations and guidance material as created and  applied to the repair of aircraft. The FAA classifies repairs  into two categories: major and minor. Following is the FAA’s  definition of both:  

Major repair means a repair:  

1.	 That, if improperly done, might appreciably affect  weight, balance, structural strength, performance,  powerplant operation, flight characteristics, or other  qualities affecting airworthiness; or 2.	 That is not done according to accepted practices or  cannot be done by elementary operations.  

Minor repair means a repair other than a major repair. It is  recognized and allowed by the FAA, that the weight and  balance and powerplant reference as stated in paragraph (1)  under major repair is not applied to parachute repairs, but all  other standards are mandatory.  

So, the person performing the maintenance as applies to  parachutes in the view of the FAA is the one who decides  if the repair or alteration is major or minor, and that person  could be a rigger, a repairman (who must be employed by  a manufacturer), or a person under the direct supervision  of an appropriately-rated and qualified rigger (person with  appropriate facilities, machines, tools, and materials).  

The manufacturer can determine if a repair is major or minor  and delegate authority to rated riggers or lofts in the field  to perform repairs to their required standards and approved  data. The FAA or their representative can also determine  what category the task may be. Often, these authorizations  considered by manufacturers are a one-time only allowance  or limited to a specific certificated or an approved TSO piece  or type of equipment.  

Now we know who is responsible to make the determination  on whether a repair or alteration is major or minor, but how  will they decide?  

For some time, the FAA has published in Advisory Circular  (AC) 120-77, Maintenance and Alteration Data, a chart  to assist the technician in determining what type of repair  qualifies and in which category as it applies to aircraft repair. Shown in  Figure 7-13  is an example repair decision chart  that riggers can use (both senior and master) to determine the  processes that need to be followed when excessive wear or  damage is identified during the inspection process.  

It allows for consideration of repair for both TSO equipment  and non TSO. It also brings into effect the need for  verification of the possibility of existing Safety Bulletin’s  (SBs) or Airworthiness Directives (ADs) that may apply to  the items found to be damaged during the inspection process.  

# Contamination Conditions  

During the inspection process, in many cases the focus is  to locate and identify material damage, tears, rips, broken  stitches, pulled tread, and burns, which generally are very  apparent should they exist. Damage can exist in forms that  are less apparent to the material properties/assembly. Much  less obvious, but just as important, is contamination.  

Contamination conditions can be critical to the repair  process and have a direct effect as to the decision of the  repair type (major/minor) status. Listed below are common  types of contamination conditions, their visual verification  properties, and the manufacturer recommended processes to  

![](images/7a4c2bda6bae21f5faed6980b57245a80f703bd94357e3c353d87e4b7e9a42b9.jpg)  

All repairs (minor or major) require that the rigger conducting the repairs: 1. Have complete knowledge to perform the job, to include certification and authorization. 2. All the proper equipment, to include sewing machines and/or hand tools. 3. Materials proper and applicable to the task and production standards. 4. Skills to operate the machines, tools, and exercise knowledge and ability during the activity to complete the task or repair to the highest possible standards.  

repair. Identification of these conditions and rigger-applied  repairs determine their effect on the airworthiness of the  parachute assembly.  

# Acid Contamination  

Nylon that has been contaminated by acid may have  irregular shaped spots of gray or dead white color. The  acid-contaminated fabric may also become powdery when  scraped lightly. Parachute components suspected of acid  contamination may be tested with blue litmus paper. Dampen  the suspect area with distilled water. Then lay the litmus  paper on the area in question. If the paper turns pink, acid is  present. Be careful not to touch the litmus paper, as touching  the paper can cause an erroneous response.  

# Action  

If an area tests positive for acid and the effected area is  known to be localized, that area should be neutralized  with a solution of distilled water and ammonia. Household  ammonia works. Ammonia does not damage nylon or  hardware. The damaged area should be removed and  the resulting hole should be patched. If the extent of  contamination cannot be determined or if it effects large  portions of the parachute, the parachute should be first  destroyed, then disposed of.  

# Salt Water Contamination  

Crystals of dry salt and the presence of pale brown circular  stains are often evidence of salt-water exposure. If the  parachute is allowed to dry after salt-water immersion  without being rinsed in fresh water, salt crystals form causing  damage to the fabric and suspension lines.  

# Action  

Parachutes exposed to salt water should be rinsed out several  times in warm fresh water in a smooth tub. Use of a water  softener is recommended. Hang assembly in drying tower  in accordance with the section within this chapter titled,  Drying a Parachute. The maximum complete salt-water  immersion limits for the parachute are listed below. The  parachute assembly should be cleaned within 8 hours of  immersion. Remove from service any parachute assembly  or sub-assembly for any of the following conditions:  

1. 	 Immersion in salt water for more than 6 hours if the  parachute contains cadmium plated parts. 2. 	 Immersion in salt water for more than 24 hours if  the parachute contains stainless steel parts (i.e.,  slider stops). 3. 	 Immersion in salt water and cannot be cleaned for  36 hours.  

# Removal of Perspiration  

Perspiration causes damage to the parachute much like salt  water does. Small amounts are not significant and may be  ignored. For larger areas heavily contaminated, clean the  parachute in accordance with the Removal of Salt Water  Contamination section above.  

# Removal of Fresh Water  

Dry parachute assembly in accordance with the section titled,  Drying a Parachute.  

# Removal of Mildew  

The following steps should be taken when removing mildew  

from the parachute: 1. 	 Wash affected area with mild soap and water solution. 2. 	 Rinse affected area thoroughly with fresh, clear water. 3. 	 Hang assembly in drying tower in accordance with  the section titled, Drying a Parachute.  

# Removal of Petroleum Products  

Hydrocarbons usually do not harm nylon. Petroleum  products, such as oil or grease, have a greenish or brownish  appearance. Wash the affected area by repeated applications  of mild soap and water solution until the affected area is  clean. Each application shall be followed by a rinse in clean  fresh water. Once complete, hang assembly in drying tower  in accordance with the section titled, Drying a Parachute.  

# Removal of Bloodstains  

The following steps should be taken when removing  bloodstains from the parachute:  

1. 	 Soak the stained area in cold water. 2. 	 Hand wash affected area with mild soap and  water solution. 3. 	 Rinse affected area thoroughly with fresh clean water. 4. 	 Hang assembly in drying tower in accordance with  the section titled Drying a Parachute.  

# Removal of Soil  

The following steps should be taken when removing soil  from the parachute:  

1. 	 Hang the parachute and shake to remove most of the  dirt and sand.  2. 	 Brush lightly with a soft-bristled brush. 3. 	 If the assembly is extremely contaminated, perform  the following:  

a. 	 Wash only the soiled areas in warm water with a  mild soap.    b.	 Rinse affected area thoroughly with fresh  clean water. 4. 	 Hang assembly in drying tower in accordance with  the section titled, Drying a Parachute.  

# Drying a Parachute  

The procedure for drying a parachute is critical. Asymmetric  shrinkage may occur if the parachute is dried unevenly. Perform the following steps:  

1. 	 Remove pilot chute assembly and/or drogue/slider  control line.  2. 	 Hang parachute full-length or the seams may  experience uneven shrinkage creating a built in turn. 3. 	 Hang reserve parachute assembly by all four connector  links for the same time.  

# Cleaning the Parachute  

Sometimes during the inspection process, excessive amounts  of dirt or debris are found caused from misuse or poor  landing. Also, there are occasions when the customer may  request that the assembly be cleaned.  

Washing a parachute is not recommended unless deemed  absolutely necessary because washing it can weaken and/ or increase the permeability of the fabric. Washing can  also cause shrinkage in the nylon fabric, tapes, and the  other components. Do not dry clean parachutes. Parachute  components may be spot cleaned or cleaned as a unit, and  care must be taken that the cleaning process does not do more  damage than the original soiling.  

# Hand Washing (If Absolutely Necessary)  

The following considerations/steps should be used when  hand washing the parachute:  

1. 	 A mild soap or soap solution and a water softener may  be used. 2. 	 Immerse the parachute into clean, fresh water  contained in a smooth vessel, such as a bathtub.  3. 	 Do not wring the parachute fabric. Damage to fabric  permeability will result. 4. 	 Gently move items by hand until all air pockets are  removed. Agitate as little as possible or damage to  fabric permeability will result.  5. 	 Empty the vessel of dirty water and refill with fresh,  warm, clear water.  6. 	 Rinse the parachute several times in warm, fresh water  until rinse water is clear.  

7. 	 Hang assembly in drying tower in accordance with  the section titled, Drying a Parachute.  

Washing the parachute is not recommended and should be  avoided if at all possible. Many times more damage can be  caused to the assembly with an improper wash as opposed  to the dirty condition of the equipment.  

# Approved Data  

Now that we have determined through inspection and use  of the chart what category of repair may be required, we  must obtain the needed data. This can sometimes verify our  determination as to the category of repair and inform us of  processes or standards. Approved is the data issue or version  of data that has been identified by the developer/supplier as  being the master issue or version of the data subject. It is  required on major repair. This data is a key element and offers  the base line of all standards that must be met for completion  of the task of returning the equipment to the user in a safe,  continued service condition.  

Riggers under FAA jurisdiction are responsible for ensuring  that repairs are accomplished according to all applicable  regulations under title 14 CFR part 43. Repair of damage can be  classified as either major, minor, or alteration. This assessment  is based on the scope and complexity of the repair, end result  of the task, and the experience and capability of the operator.  

As we know, the responsibility for determining whether a  repair is major or minor rests with the rigger. The document  needed to complete an inspection and subsequent repack  is the manufacturers owners manual. The documents that  offer standards for a repair are found in 14 CFR part 43 and  are worded with direct application to aircraft. This allows  for confusion of FAA position of repair as it applies to  manufacturers and riggers. In the U.S., all repairmen (riggers  and mechanics) have authority to use acceptable repair data  for minor repairs without additional FAA approval. These  processes are not addressed in 14 CFR part 43 as major,  minor, or alteration, and no reference is found for use on  parachutes or related components.  

Because of this rather gray area of current repair classifications  under 14 CFR part 43, many times approved data identifies  directly the classification of the repair and sets forth all  needed guidelines and requirements.  

The standards for approved or certificated equipment apply  to the reserve parachute, harness/container, and related  components, and these standards can also include any  Automatic Activation Device (AAD) that may be used in  an approved system. With the installation of the AAD, it  must meet all manufacturer service and use standards and  FAA inspection limitations. This information can be found  in the Rig Manufacturers Owners Manual and the AAD  Manufacturers Owners Manual.  

Acceptable data is often times confused with approved data.  Acceptable data has been allowed under the FAA system and  generally used for minor repair. It can be applied to many  minor repair practices of different types and application.  It is general in its nature and not a required process for an  approved repair procedure. It is used by the FAA when  considering approval for alteration and usually does not fall  under the standard of certificated or approved (TSO and major  repairs). Acceptable data is applied in a very broad manner  and is not to be a replacement for use of approved data when  addressing the FAA major repair process.  

# Types of Approved Data  

Approved data to be used for major repairs and alterations  may be one or more of the following. This data can only be  obtained from the manufacturer or the FAA Administrator.  This data applies to:  

1.	 Model, size, version 2.	 Manufacturer specifications (approval for repairs,  requirements) 3.	 TSO C23b, C23c, and C23d 4.	 ADs 5.	 Manufacturer’s SB’s 6.	 Drawings, information, or repair standards from  manufacturers research & development (R&D)  engineers 7.	 Designated alteration data offered by the FAA 8.	 Manufacturer’s manuals (including installation and  assembly instructions)  

The rigger is responsible to confirm the information of  model, type, serial number, and date of manufacture when  requesting or attempting to obtain any of the above data. It  is very important when confirming the following:  

• 	 Appropriate to the product being repaired; • 	 Directly applicable to the repair being made; and • 	 Not contrary to manufacturer’s data.  

When contacting the manufacturer or FAA Administrator  with request for information as listed for possible major  repairs, it is advisable to confirm the following:  

a.	 FAA certification required b.	 Equipment (sewing and tools) c.	 Materials, quantity, quality, and Mil-Spec  

d.	 Skills, prior knowledge, and experience with type  of repair e.	 Advisability of attempting this repair  

In many situations, it is a better decision, economically and  for the end repair, to return the damaged equipment to the  manufacturer. This answers all questions as to the quality,  manufacturer/FAA repair requirements, and airworthiness  of the item when returned to service and confirms that the  repair meets the continued service condition.  

# Repair Techniques  

The following procedures use a format that provides the  rigger with all of the necessary information to complete the  repair properly. It has been used by at least one manufacturer  to provide the necessary documentation to riggers in the field  to perform major repairs or alterations on that manufacturer’s  equipment. The procedures provide the following information  to the rigger:  

1.	 Applicable products—those parts of the parachute that  the procedure addresses. 2.	 Description—brief explanation of the repair or  alteration. 3.	 Materials—those items needed to perform the  procedure. 4.	 Machines—those machines required to do the  procedure. In addition to the machines, there may be  special attachments required to do the work properly. 5.	 Equipment—additional tools needed (in addition to  the sewing machines). 6.	 Procedure—the step-by-step guide through the repair.  This may include a disassembly and reassembly  procedure. Disassembly may be straightforward, but  the reassembly instructions may provide special tips  or procedures to accomplish the task.  

7.	 Inspection—the final inspection of the finished repair.  This is a very critical part. In many cases, the rigger  is doing the work alone. Within the manufacturing  environment, the persons doing the work generally  do not inspect their own work. This is given over to  dedicated inspection personnel. For the private rigger,  there may be no one around to inspect the work. In  the case of simple repairs, it is easy for the rigger to  inspect the finished job. For more extensive repairs,  such as a harness main lift web replacement, there  can be several areas that need to be addressed, such  as dimensions, stitching, and hardware orientation.  By having an inspection checklist, the rigger can be  assured of not missing any critical area.  

Each of the seven sections in this chapter has a list that  describes common repair procedures today’s rigger might  use. While not necessarily encompassing everything, the  techniques used in these repairs can be expanded upon to  address almost any other scenario that might be encountered.  This is acceptable data as referred to earlier in the chapter. If  the rigger encounters a repair that he or she is not familiar with,  then the rigger should contact the manufacturer for further  direction and guidance. The rigger should also remember that  each procedure is just one method of accomplishing a given  repair. There might be more than one or an individual might  develop a different technique to achieve the same results.  The exception to this is approved data that requires a specific  procedure, rating, equipment, materials, or repair process.  

No matter what techniques or procedures that are followed,  remember that there are three basic requirements to follow  for any proper repair procedure.  

1.	 Knowledge to do the job, to include the required  certification and authorization 2.	 Proper equipment, such as sewing machines or  hand tools 3.	 Availability of the proper materials  

The individual may be a master rigger with a complete  parachute loft at his or her disposal but, without the materials  as used in the original manufacture, the correct repair cannot be  made. By following these simple guidelines, riggers are always  able to determine whether or not they can do the job properly.  

Most of today’s manufacturers provide guidance for the  repair and maintenance of their products. These instructions  are the official guidelines that the rigger must follow. The  four primary areas of parachute repair and maintenance are:  canopy and lines; container; harness and risers; and accessory  components. These areas are summarized within the seven  sections of this chapter as follows:  

•	 Section 1—Canopy and lines  •	 Section 2—Container  •	 Section 3—Harness and Risers  •	 Section 4—Accessory Components  •	 Section 5—Alterations  •	 Section 6—Manufacturing  •	 Section 7—Miscellaneous  

# Section 1, Canopy and Lines  

There are two general categories of canopies: round and  square. While there are other canopy types, their construction  and repair techniques generally follow those of the round and  square canopies.  Figure 7-14  shows a round canopy repair  table, created from current military manuals, and describes  the types and limits of canopy repairs, most of which pertain  to military or surplus canopies. It must be mentioned that all  of the services differ in their approach to methods of repair.  Those called out in this book are methods that have been  proven to be practical and efficient and commonly accepted  throughout the parachute industry. The techniques are  similar with only minor differences in seam dimensions and  tolerances. While these limits are practical from the technical  point of view, the economic cost may not be in many cases.  

NOTE:  Ripstop tape is listed in the table as an acceptable  repair for certificated round canopies; this table comes from  military manuals that have not been addressed or updated  

![Figure 7-14.  Table of round canopy repairs and limitations. ](images/f4501bdeec3afaa0362804a09a1ff6a422e6246d3b0a62c1634377afac583477.jpg)  

for many years but are currently still in use. Contact with  current certificated parachute manufacturers has proven that  none currently recognize or accept this type of repair as an  approved procedure and do not recommend the use of ripstop  tape on any parachute in production. It is highly advised that  before affecting any type of repair with the use of ripstop tape  on an approved parachute that the manufacturer be contacted  for confirmation and the request of an approval document  before completing this type of repair.  

Figure 7-15  shows a table of square canopy repairs  and limitations. These are for reference only. Not all  manufacturers recognize the same types of repairs. The  information in this table is an excepted cross-section of  allowable repairs. The rigger should consult with the  manufacturers to confirm what repairs are allowed on any  particular canopy.  

# Detailed Information on Square Canopy Repairs  

Holes or snags smaller than the size of one ripstop box   $\sqrt[1]{8}$  inch,   $3.2~\mathrm{mm})$  ) may remain unrepaired as long as no more  than one hole exists within any 10-inch   $(25.4\;\mathrm{cm})$  ) circle. A  maximum of three such holes or snags per cell are allowed.  

Ripstop tape is not authorized for use on parachutes. If the  damage is enough to warrant a repair, a sewn repair must be  performed. Darning is not a means of repairing any parachute  currently in production.  

Any hole or tear up to 10 inches   $25.4\;\mathrm{cm})$   in length may  be repaired by a Senior Rigger as long as the closest area  of the completed repair is at least 1 inch from the nearest  seam and at least 5 inches from the nearest tape or line  attachment. These are minor repairs. Any damage or hole  larger than 10 inches   $25.4\,\mathrm{cm})$   may be repaired by a Master  Rigger, in either direction or involving a seam or tape. This  is a major repair.  

Any damage that requires a repair of an area that is larger  than 50 percent of the total area of a cell skin (upper or  lower) requires cell skin replacement and should be returned  to the manufacturer.  

Master riggers may perform repairs that do not involve taking  apart any bartacks on the canopy unless they have the correct  bartack machine or equivalent. Special bartack patterns are  used that are not normally found in the field. In addition,  removal and replacement of these stitch patterns usually  weakens the fabric to the point that it is necessary to replace or  reinforce portions of the panels. This should also be considered  in the repairs of load bearing and non load bearing ribs as most  have these types of bartack stitches located at the ends.  

Before performing a repair, contact with the canopy  manufacturer is very important, as some of these repair  standards and limitations may vary slightly.  

# Materials  

Certified canopies should only be repaired using certified  materials or equivalent. All replacement materials should  come from the manufacturer or meet production quality  and shelf life standards. Under-strength thread and fabric is  frequently found in the field. The only way to be sure the  material meets manufacturer standards is to obtain them  directly from manufacturer or locate materials recognized by  the manufacturer as acceptable for the repair needed.  

The following are the repairs found in Section 1, Canopy  and Lines:  

•	 Seam re-stitching •	 Canopy ripstop tape repair •	 Round and square canopy—basic patch •	 Round canopy—panel replacement •	 Square canopy—partial panel replacement •	 Square canopy—rib repair •	 Square canopy—pilot chute attachment point repair •	 Round canopy—non-continuous line replacement •	 Square canopy—main line replacement •	 Square canopy—control line replacement •	 Square canopy—crossport repair •	 Square canopy—trim check and re-trim  

![Figure 7-15.  Table of square canopy repairs and limitations. ](images/b39b9ad800bdcfc281897ac2b2bcc4d6fc4917fc73851084ef3f1cd4194ebf16.jpg)  

Some methods are covered with older processes and  procedures of repair; some include the newest methods as  are used by most riggers today. All methods are acceptable to  provide a safe and airworthy repair, but it should always be  the focus of the rigger to understand all methods and strive  to utilize the best possible technique to allow for repairs to  be completed to the highest possible standards.  

# Seam Restitching  

•	 Applicable products: All canopies—round and square;  main and reserve •	 Description: Replacement of broken or damaged  seam threads. •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match original •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—light duty 7–11 stitches  per inch (SPI), 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper  

# Procedure  

On lightweight material, the rigger should first set up the  machine with similar material and thickness to set the tension  of the machine before sewing the actual parachute.  

1.	 Inspect the damaged thread or seam area. If the thread  is merely broken or frayed, overstitch the seam with  a minimum of 4 to 6 inches at each end. 2.	 If the seam is gathered or bunched up, it may be  necessary to cut the thread in order to smooth out  the seam and then overstitch the damaged area  with a minimum of 4 to 6 inches at each end.  [Figure A  and  Figure B]  

![](images/08e1200a560f0d747fcaee068c81ecd4702e34ed3263098c0ecab8cb817ce3f0.jpg)

3.	 If the restitching was done on a radial seam of a round  canopy, which has a tape or suspension line within the  seam, make sure you did not catch the tape or line in  the stitching.

 4.	 For zigzag stitching, such as on suspension lines, a .25  inch overstitch on each end is standard.  [Figure C]  

![](images/e070d16d6661bedcbe87c9df91c842fb9563f41bf2962b40ec98cdd04abe7995.jpg)  

# Inspection  

•	 Check that the seam tension and stitch length match  the original. Make sure to check top and bottom. 

 •	 Make sure that you have not captured any adjacent  fabric in the seam. This is a common mistake on  square canopies where you may have three panels  joining together. 

 •	 On radial seams, slide the seam material up and down  over the tape or line to check for free movement.  

# Canopy Ripstop Tape Repair  

•	 Applicable products: All main canopies. Reserve  canopies as specified by the manufacturer

 •	 Description: Using ripstop tape for temporary or minor  canopy repairs

 •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger 

 •	 Materials: Ripstop tape—color to match fabric E  thread (optional)

 •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7 — 11  SPI (optional)

 •	 Equipment: Scissors, shot bags, wallpaper roller, and  scotch tape (optional)  

# Procedure  

1.	 Spread out the canopy on a smooth surface.  

2.	 Smooth out the damaged area and hold in place with  the shot bags.  [Figure A]  

![](images/6631ec38ed9724c455f9d8eb0673aca766466ddcd563ec87d0d638b649b89fd6.jpg)  

3.	 Inspect the damaged area.  

4.	 Trim any loose threads and smooth any loose fabric  back into place.  

5.	 For small holes, a single-side patch will suffice. For  holes up to .5-inch in diameter or a tear, a double-sided  patch is necessary.

 6.	 If the damage is a tear, the two sides must be positioned  so the edges touch. Use scotch tape to temporarily hold  the edges together.  [Figure B]

 7.	 For a hole, cut a piece of ripstop tape 2 inches square.  For a double-sided patch, cut two pieces.  [Figure C]  For  a tear, cut the tape approximately 2 inches longer than  the length of the tear and cut two pieces.  

![](images/1f0880d77f631eedffd367d5d490f10535e2be4cdce95d5510a5211aee6440d6.jpg)  

![](images/73b11890fbaec28daddd71eea3ed84ba1bc0af3e22fd8c550cb7edb07854c49a.jpg)  

8.	 For the single-side patch, round the corners with  approximately a  $\%$   inch radius. For the double-sided  patches, place the two pieces face to face and round the  corners of both pieces at the same time. This ensures  a perfect match and alignment.  [Figure D]  

![](images/df3158913b9a53d52596e39ebdc4896aec2dd4dd5ed477945f0023696e723bfe.jpg)  

9.	 For the  $2\times2$   inch patch, peel back one edge of the  paper backing and center the tape over the damaged  area. Press the exposed adhesive side of the tape to  the fabric and smoothly peel the rest of the paper from  the fabric with one hand while smoothing the fabric  with the other hand.  [Figure E]  

![](images/735d30d53d4cdef544b0cea5c830a3b25e1b290784461d9c17cd666d44bb9c8a.jpg)  

10.	 Use the wallpaper roller to smooth out the patch and  remove any air bubbles from the patch.  [Figure F]  

![](images/3a21dbaf03dcbe132b84334dde9cc5a84e9bc5923b35b531c8d23f9911f58f74.jpg)  

11.	 For a double-side patch, turn the canopy or damaged  material inside out. Align the second piece of ripstop  with the edges of the first and repeat the process. Again  smooth out the tape with the roller.  

12.	 If the patch is to be a temporary one, the repair is  complete. If, however, it is to be permanent, it may  be advisable to sew around the edge of the patch.  In this case, use the single-needle machine and sew  approximately   $\%$   inch in from the edge of the tape.  Overstitch a minimum of 1.25 inches.  [Figure G]  

![](images/67ad6cd3553eed1d781a7d3e8195308a749bb8e84389c5efb248a234fd31e525.jpg)  

NOTE:  Ripstop tape has in the past been a commonly used  repair material, on F-111 materials, as a short-term repair.  Time has shown, however, that the adhesive used can be  detrimental to the strength of the fabric over the long term.  Consequently, manufacturers do not recommend its use  on certificated canopies. In addition, some of the modern,  coated fabrics do not accept the use of the ripstop tape  without additional sewing to help hold it in place. If the  damage requires the use of a sewing machine to complete  the repair, it is required of certified parachutes and advised  on non- certificated parachutes to utilize the Parachute Patch  method, to perform the required repair.  

# Inspection  

•	 The ripstop should be centered over the damaged area. •	 The tape should be smooth with no air bubbles. •	 Double-sided patches must be aligned. •	 If sewn, tension, edge spacing, and overstitch must  be correct.  

# Round and Square Canopy—Basic Patch Repair  

In 1986, R.D. Raghanti, a Production Engineer working as a  Master Parachute Rigger , created a new method of parachute  repair utilizing the ripstop box configuration as observed  on parachute material during production. By utilizing the  material “map” ripstop box lines, he created the process of  placing repair patches and confirming material replacement  during repairs to match the existing grid and establish proper  placement of the repair. This process greatly improved  parachute repair techniques and is recognized today by most  as the industry standard.  

•	 Applicable products: All canopies—round and square;  main and reserve  

•	 Description: Application of a basic canopy patch

 •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger 

 •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; fabric—type and  color to match

 •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—light duty 7–11 SPI

 •	 Equipment: Canopy or material to be repaired,  marking pencil, single-needle sewing machine with  E thread, ruler, hemostat, scissors, and nippers  

10.	 Count down 14 ripstop boxes from any corner of  the 7-inch square piece and make a start mark.  [Figure 7-17]  

![](images/f055d2c63c13579ef0a697f1def372c8af2b3ca239d973e457df4fecb8562bd0.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.  Start point.  

# Procedure  

1.	 Be sure you have found all the damage.

 2.	 Mark the boundaries of the damage.

 3.	 Allow 2 inches for repair and fudge factor from  each boundary.

 4.	 A 6-inch patch will cover approximately 2 square  inches of damage. A 7-inch square piece of fabric  will be needed to make a 6-inch patch, using  $\%$  -inch  seam allowance. Always put the patch on the inside  of the parachute.

 5.	 Find the center of the damage on the   $13\%$  -inch  square piece.

 6.	 Measure half the patch size or 3 inches out to the left  of the center of damage following one ripstop line in  the fabric.

 7.	 Make a center mark and a left border mark (this will  look like a T laying on its side).

 8.	 Measure half the patch size or 3 inches up the left  border ripstop line from the center line and mark the  top border and left border (this will look like an upside  down L).  [Figure 7-16]  

11.	 Place the 2 start marks on top of each other using the  hemostat to hold the 4 block seam allowance in place  and sink the needle. Always sew counter clockwise  around patches so that the bulk of the parachute  does not have to go through the bed of the machine.  [Figure 7-18]

12.	 Count up 4 blocks from the bottom edge of the patch  and use the hemostat to form a corner, line up the  ripstop boxes, and load each piece with the same  pressure. Then, sew to the corner.  [Figure 7-19]   13.	 Repeat this step until the first two corners are sewn  down. At this point, check the last corner to assure  that it will fall in the top and left border marks (upside  down L) were made when you the measurement step  was completed. Then, sew the last two corners down.  [Figure 7-20] 14.	 While sewing, it is important to pull the fabric at  the same speed the machine is going and to set the  hook in the stitch loop before lifting the foot to turn  a corner. Always make a four to six-inch oversew.  [Figure 7-21]

# Round Canopy—Panel Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: All round canopies—main  and reserve •	 Description: Complete replacement of a panel section  of a gore of a round canopy •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; fabric—type and  color to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—light duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper, marking pencil,  6-inch ruler, large pin board, and straight pins  

# Procedure  

This process of replacing the panel is in reality a panel patch  and is similar to that used in making a basic canopy patch.  Because of the time and difficulty involved in removing and  replacing the actual panel, that technique is best left to the  canopy manufacturer. This technique is the more commonly  accepted practice for major panel repair. The major issue to be  dealt with in this technique is that of the amount of shrinkage  that occurs during the repair. The larger the area of the  panel, the more shrinkage occurs. The following procedure  describes a panel replacement on a block constructed, non- continuous line canopy. A bias constructed canopy is similar  but more “fullness” needs to be allowed for in the cutting of  the panel and sewing.  

1.	 Lay the canopy inside out on the pin board. Pin the  canopy by placing tension on the seams and making  sure they are straight. 2.	 Cut a piece of fabric larger than the damaged panel by  approximately 6 inches around all sides. Make sure  that the weave of the panel matches that of the canopy.  For a block constructed canopy, the bolt of fabric runs  parallel down the radial seams of the canopy. For a  bias constructed canopy, the bolt runs parallel to the  diagonal seams. 3.	 Trim one side of the panel to align the ripstop weave  with the cross seam. 4.	 Fold over the edge of the panel fabric approximately   $\%$   inch and pin in place aligning the edge with the  outside of the cross seam.  [Figure A]  

![](images/6499cb73fb6f1f050ebf9f73f8ae356ec132026a1ffc5241c89d9713b0884a4b.jpg)  

5.	 Smooth out the panel fabric over the damaged area  and align the opposite edge over the opposite cross  seam. Cut the panel fabric approximately 1 inch wider  than the panel. Fold the edge under and pin in place.  You now have the top and bottom cross seams of the  panel in place.  [Figure B] 6.	 Stitch the outside row of stitching starting and finishing  approximately 1 inch short of the radial seams. 7.	 Take the panel fabric along the radial seam and trim  approximately   $\%$   inch from the outside edge of the  radial seam. Fold under and pin in place. Repeat for  the opposite radial seam.  [Figure  $C J$  

![](images/dd9cbee67cdb0e45115b893655f517fb2f798708edcdb4f5398310771a9ffa25.jpg)  

8.	 Overstitch the end of the cross seam that was left open  a minimum of 2 inches and proceed to and down the  radial seam and then overstitch the open end of the  cross seam. Repeat for the opposite side. It is advisable  to hold a bit of tension on the seams as you sew to  minimize the shrinkage.  

9.	 Turn the canopy right side out. Trim out the damaged  panel along the seams, leaving approximately  $\%$   inch.  [Figure D]  Also trim the excess edge of the panel  as needed.

 10.	 Fold the edge of the canopy under the panel to create  the seam and pin in place.

 11.	 Sew the inside of the panel seam in place. Again, hold  tension on the fabric as you sew to minimize shrinkage.

 12.	 Remove the canopy from the machine being careful  not to pull on the threads. Trim the threads. Inspect  the panel.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the weave alignment of the fabric panel to  the canopy.  

![](images/b2d3f9ad0307aa4786365419e3df8e6ccba51993a4ea59161b9433aa0707fad7.jpg)  

•	 Check for proper thread tension all around. •	 Seams should be straight and parallel. •	 The resulting size of the panel should match  approximately that of adjacent panels allowing for  shrinkage.  

# Square Canopy—Partial Panel Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most main and reserve canopies •	 Description: Replacement of a partial panel(s) in a  canopy where the extent of the damage necessitates  more than a single large or multiple small patches. •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread, fabric—type and color to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—light duty 7–11 SPI,  308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI (optional), 1 inch   $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper, marking pencil,  36-inch ruler, pin board or large cardboard box folded  flat, straight pins, scotch tape or equivalent  

# Procedure  

The method of repair presented in this section is an acceptable  data method. It is advised if possible to utilize the R.D.  Raghanti process as viewed in the Basic Patch Repair section  to allow for higher quality of repair.  

NOTE:  The repair described in the following procedure is  a major tear across the bottom surface of the canopy and  includes damage to a non-loadbearing rib.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Determine the extent of the damage. Mark out the  damaged area across the panel, following the weave  of the fabric. Unpick the loaded seams that hold  the damaged fabric for at least 8–10 inches past the  

damage area mark. It is always easier to unpick more  of the seam to allow better access to the damaged area.  Restitching the seam is one of the easiest operations.  Fighting the canopy is not.  

2.	 Unpick the non-loaded seam the same distance as the  loaded seams.  

3.	 Lay the canopy on the floor, take the pin board or  cardboard box and position it under the damaged area.  Take the scotch tape and tape the raw edges of the tear  together to stabilize the panel.  [Figure A]  

![](images/0120141fc7b5fcebbb560eb4d3b647289eecd77a80edf9b2c6f4b6dc95b36033.jpg)  

4.	 Pin the damaged panel to the pin board. Do not  overstretch the fabric, but make sure to take all the  slack out so the panel is square. In this instance, the  canopy had spanwise reinforcing tapes, which were  used to stabilize the canopy; however, one of them  was damaged and requires replacement. [Figure B]  

![](images/03d56617f2d20003a5adf3196bc52c61a3b91836b54e5bbb556726b6c5225f7b.jpg)  
5.	 Mark a line on the fabric at least 2 inches from the  damage area on both sides of the damaged panel.  [Figure C]  

![](images/e2e9e80505643264a1342d71c68f09d31ca2214e80926e8bd11566fda674fa6d.jpg)  
Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a piece of fabric approximately 6 inches wider  and longer than the damaged panel area. Make sure  that one of the edges is straight and even with the  weave of the fabric. Trim one of the adjacent sides at  90 degrees to the straight edge.  

2.	 Mark a line parallel to the straight edge at  $\%$   inch from  the edge. Center the new panel on the damaged one.  Fold the fabric on this line and pin in place along the  damage line.  [Figure D]  Smooth the new panel fabric  over the damaged panel to the opposite side. Trim the  new panel  $\%$   inch longer than the damage line. Fold  the fabric at the line and pin in place.  [Figure E]  

![](images/adbcfba64ba2776f3cace777d1c695eb99ffd57fdaa576f4da760193b3fb77f8.jpg)  

3.	 Check the tension of the two panels. They should  

4.	 Take a straightedge and mark the location of the  spanwise reinforcing tape.  [Figure F]

 5.	 Sew the panel along the outer edge at .12 inch from  the folded edge.  

![](images/41501a61ecf793e3c258f92349fea33c0d3afd878dead69245b13dc9c1649a4a.jpg)

6.	 Turn the panel inside out. Trim the damaged panel at  .62 inch from the edge of the panel edge.  [Figure G]  

![](images/b5553dc9635d906ee4a58bf9bf5c5a26ccbce850fac5f740edf336b31e316517.jpg)  

7.	 Fold the fabric under to create a French fell seam. Sew  a stitch row .12 inch from the folded edge.  

8.	 Sew a piece of reinforcing tape on the bottom of the  replacement panel along the line for the spanwise  reinforcing tape.  [Figure H]  

![](images/349a543c47d00e8f7c20f6063bd8ce0d03886fa8a7658eb0c82fdceaee8215d6.jpg)  
9.	 Repair the non-loadbearing rib with a three-sided  patch.  [Figure I]  

![](images/b8ae9aaaeabfe2d4e6ee522952b5d8d8481081c3de4cb3a94a1e59f4ada00fa7.jpg)  
10.	 Draw a line along the edge of the partial panel on each  side from the point where the old panel meets the new  one. Trim the fabric along this line.  [Figure J]  

![](images/2d7c1e9a0ddf3610af5988317cf7ec314d7bea046049a92f11e64bbc65833079.jpg)  

11.	 Check the tension of the new partial panel piece  against the edges of the other panels that formed the  original seam. They should all be equal.  [Figure K]  

![](images/0bc6bad22a8286bcb958d899b373edc1ca5e289ba9ab90a9edd73b2d0a081a2c.jpg)  

12.	 Refold the original seam with the three panel edges and  stitch as per the original seam.  [Figure L]  Overstitch  a minimum of 2 inches on each end.  

![](images/0b898a56596df0b0f8fcfc60a32445dfab524258e135a9430155bfdd14973ad2.jpg)  

13.	 If a line attachment has been removed for the repair,  the tab must be replaced. Make sure that the line/tab  does not have a twist in it. Locate it at the correct  location and reattach as per original.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the fabric tension of the replaced panel. It  should be equal to that in the remainder of the cell.

 •	 Spanwise reinforcing tape should be straight and sewn.

 •	 Seams should be folded correctly and thread tension  even along both rows of stitching.

 •	 Line should be attached correctly and have no twists.  

# Square Canopy—Rib Repair  

•	 Applicable products: square canopies; main and  reserve •	 Description: Rib repair on a square canopy •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute  Rigger —mains and reserves; FAA Senior Parachute  Rigger—mains  •	 Materials: E thread; fabric—type and color to match,  reinforcing tape—type and color as per original •	 Machines: 301 dtraight dtitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, 1 inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack, double needle with  puller attachment (optional) and SPI to match original •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper, marking pencil,  ruler, pin board, straight pins, and patching square  

# Procedure  

Repairing a rib of a square canopy is similar to doing a  partial panel repair. The biggest difference comes when the  rib is either:  

1.	 A “loaded” rib or one with support tapes for the line  attachment points, or  2.	 A crossport is damaged and needs to be repaired  and recut. In this case, the crossport area needs  replacement.  [Figure A]  

![](images/7f809ddcbc850983f1889e9189fdf31e7c532b8359836f414d7b55c415952521.jpg)  

Disassembly  

1.	 Determine the extent of the damaged area and unpick  the top and bottom seams to access the rib.  [Figure B] In most cases, restitching the rib to the top and bottom  panels is fairly straightforward. Because of this,  opening up the seam for a good distance (18 inches  plus either side of the proposed patch) allows easier  access and sewing. 2.	 Pin the damaged rib to the pin board to stabilize the  material for marking. Mark out the damaged portion  of the panel, following the weave of the fabric.  

![](images/3b30eb1b765458db3e8c0be210cbba331d66e32b58c2259c9616d60b7d270945.jpg)  

[Figure C]  This will be the patch fold lines and the  limits of the partial rib panel.  NOTE:  The tears of  the crossports have been taped together and that the  crossport has been pinned down to stabilize the fabric  during the marking process.  

![](images/fde7acf8978a730103b22b6467c44ffe5fd24fcef7bd9bc450f09e2b31e3dc94.jpg)  

3.	 Using the patching square, mark a parallel line .75  inch inside the patch fold lines and then another one  .62 inch inside the second line.  [Figure D]  The inner  lines are the trim lines for the rib patch.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a piece of fabric approximately 4 inches wider  and longer than the damaged panel area. Make sure  that one of the width edges is straight and even with  the weave of the fabric.  

2.	 Fold the straight edge .75 inch from the edge and pin  in place across the damage line. Make sure the fabric  is centered on the existing panel.  

3.	 Remove the pins from the crossport area and smooth  the new panel fabric over the damaged panel.  

![](images/d76e9aee4ef2a55641a5c70f02b3cd6d3ae98073ffd6eab97820bba9d7855f77.jpg)  
4.	 Fold the new fabric outwards at the patch fold mark  and pin in place. Use the patching square to mark a  line at .75 inch in from the fold line.  [Figure E]  

![](images/a24348dddd5d90e33bce64f295ea213ac5d5709944e1e06ae6d6ef74c7bbf986.jpg)  
5.	 Trim the repair panel at the inner line, fold under and  pin in place.  [Figure F]

6.	 Check the tension of the two panels. They should  be equal. Mark the top and bottom edges and the  crossport location.  [Figure   $G$    and  Figure H]  

![](images/0d723f7df7d2e6691c2b6370ca8a9609b97f0fef94a76047b3768e321f38a57a.jpg)  
7.	 Remove the rib from the pin board. Sew the two  outboard seams approximately .06 inch from the edge  with the single needle.  [Figure I]  

![](images/323e8bcf9cb0a0cf56416f6720bf787a1e51927574b1757333342b4bcfafe4e7.jpg)  

8.	 Trim the original damaged panel to the trim lines.  [Figure J]  Fold the fabric under to create a French  fell seam. Repeat with the opposite seam.  [Figure K]

# Inspection  

•	 Seam alignment should be straight. •	 Check the tension of the replaced rib material. •	 Make sure the seams are restitched correctly. •	 Verify that the crossport is cut correctly. •	 The line attachment tape must be replaced correctly  with no twists in the suspension line.  

# Square Canopy—Pilot Chute Attachment Point  Repair  

•	 Applicable Products: Square main canopies •	 Description: Repair of the main canopy pilot chute  attachment point. •	 Authorized Repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread; fabric—type and color to match,  reinforcing tape—type and color to match, reinforcing  fabric—type and color to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, 1 inch  $\times$  42 stitch bar tack •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper, marking pencil,  and 12–inch ruler  

# Procedure  

This repair is quite common. If the canopy is inspected  regularly, the beginnings of the damage will be noticed and  a simple re-stitching will solve the problem. However, many  times it is not and the resultant damage is quite extensive  requiring repair of the rib, as well as the top panel.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Inspect the area to determine the extent of the damage.  [Figure  $A J$   If the stitching that holds the attachment  point to the canopy is simply coming loose, re-stitch  as per the original.  

![](images/d692ae5137e6d173a39cda31dad1ce2497aa3c372217f67de13a46c2bbcbe129.jpg)  

2.	 If the canopy fabric is damaged, then turn the canopy  inside out. The center rib should have a reinforced  area that brackets the attachment point.  [Figure B]  

![](images/696682401cd70180536576ec4122a8dfce2aa29e1879c24246dcd77c545c9578.jpg)  

3.	 Detach the top of the rib from the top surface of the cell  where the attachment point is located.  [Figure C]  If  the rib is damaged, then a rib repair is needed.  

![](images/36916715354eb083fd326ab8567afd5ea698a94607a949c9449cf918603a4b94.jpg)  

4.	 Usually the top skin of the cell needs to be repaired.  Again, depending on the extent of the damage,  either perform a patch on the panel or a partial  panel replacement.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 After the top skin is repaired, a new reinforcement  patch needs to be installed on the center of the cell so  that it is centered over the attachment point.

 2.	 Take the pre-cut reinforcement panel and sew it in  place with two rows of the single-needle machine.  The corners should be folded in at a 45 degree angle to  eliminate any point loading on the corners.  [Figure D]  

![](images/62b21698a6741797d0811b0865131becc66f691237c6553af5fc134d3f595369.jpg)  

3.	 Reattach the rib to the top surface of the canopy as  per the original configuration.

 4.	 Install a new pilot chute attachment tape and ring at  the appropriate location.  [Figure E]

# Inspection  

•	 Check that rib and panel repairs have been made  as needed. •	 Verify the new top reinforcing panel is in place with  two rows of single-needle stitching. •	 Check the new attachment tape and ring for the  appropriate stitch pattern.  

# Round Canopy—Non-continuous Line  Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Round canopies—main and  reserve. •	 Description: Replacement of a suspension line on a  round canopy with non-continuous line configuration. •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread; Suspension line—type and color  to match •	 Machines: 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, 1  inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Packing table, scissors, seam ripper or  scalpel, marking pencil, 6-inch ruler, 60-pound fish  scale or equivalent, and finger-trapping needle  

# Procedure  

The most common need for this type of repair today is as a  result of the suspension line of the reserve being damaged  during packing or occasionally during use after landing.  The newer, lightweight braided lines are very susceptible to  being snagged on the hook portion of Velcro ®  closures on  the container if care is not taken by the rigger.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Lay the canopy out on the packing table. Straighten the  canopy ensuring the apex is straight and even tension  on the lines. 2.	 Remove the damaged line from the canopy.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a new line from the same material as the original  approximately 36 inches longer than the damaged line. 2.	 Pre-stretch the line by applying approximately  10 percent of its rated strength for a minimum of  15 minutes. 3.	 Attach the line to the connector link in the same manner  as the original. Most of the newer canopies use braided  line and a finger-trap attachment technique.  [Figure A] 4.	 Zigzag or bar tack the line, whichever is appropriate.  

![](images/5bf893a10310a087084d2bfedf38f2918112f36aaee0860329065016b470073d.jpg)  

5.	 Run the free end of the line to the canopy. If the canopy  utilizes a V-tab configuration, route the line through  the V-tab.  [Figure B]  

![](images/99f235dc7a2d53431228906d7e866f3bf8189c8fe4113fe31d5ad8d0e02386a2.jpg)  

6.	 Pull the V-tab down until it is even with the rest of the  skirt. Mark the line at the edge of the skirt and pin in  place.  [Figure C]  

![](images/976babfe24ab5361b2c545b0aa52597d9a69e585724e07f169bb8f7f21cfe759.jpg)  

7.	 Sew the line to the canopy with the zigzag machine  duplicating the original manufacture.  [Figure D]  Trim  the excess line from the canopy.  

![](images/56d74fc2f4052d252ff1a9ff7b47334b4b3967d78e6070b022cc818e657bc665.jpg)  

8.	 Return the canopy to the packing table, straighten,  and apply tension. Check the trim of the replaced line  against the others.  

# Inspection  

•	 Verify the line length is the same as the original with  the same tension. •	 The connector link and canopy ends must be  sewn correctly.  

# Square Canopy—Main Line Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Square main canopies. •	 Description: Replacement of main suspension lines  of square canopies. •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread •	 Machines: 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, 1  inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, finger-trapping needle, and  60-pound fish scale or equivalent  

# Procedure  

Many of the modern canopies are using Spectra ®  or other  aramid fibers in place of nylon or Dacron lines. These materials  are stronger, lighter, and less bulky. An example is the  825-pound Spectra ®  line common on many main canopies. The  strength is higher but the bulk is smaller than the 525-pound  Dacron used in the past. Accordingly, the techniques needed  to work this material are more refined and precise.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Lay the canopy out on one side and straighten the lines. 2.	 Remove the damaged line. If the cascade is undamaged,  remove the cascade line from the junction of the main  line. If the cascade is damaged, remove it as well.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a new main line approximately 24 inches longer  than the old one.

 2.	 Finger-trap a loop at the connector link end.  [Figure A]   Make sure that the size of the loop duplicates the  original or adjacent lines. If the loop is made too small,  there may be difficulty in changing connector links  or risers as needed. Sew the fingertrap with either a  zigzag or bar tack.  

![](images/3cd38ad5b10b99f471d6385113cc6316d5394ff7acdb7e08269a0a338ecac449.jpg)  

3.	 Pre-tension the line. With Spectra ® , load the line with  approximately 30 pounds for 30 seconds. Place the  line on the connector link.

 4.	 Feed the running end of the line through the slider  and directly to the line attachment tape on the canopy.  Make sure that there are no twists to the line or it is  around the other lines. Run through the attachment  tape and re-create the original knot.  [Figure B]  

![](images/e765ecf1f1cc0deb07db1fed228ef9b5607cc9d882d447cdc1e5d7525d002ea5.jpg)  

5.	 Tension the line using adjacent lines for reference.  [Figure C]

 6.	 Mark the location for the entry point for the cascade  line.  [Figure D]  

![](images/57b53e21bf505003c55889f7248937d68153d5492f39f40d6b74992938ffc418.jpg)  

7.	 Cut a piece of line approximately18 inches longer than  the original cascade.  

8.	 Finger-trap the cascade into the main line and sew  with either a zigzag or bar tack.  [Figure E]  

9.	 Attach the main line to the line attachment loop as per  the original knot configuration.  

10.	 Tension the line against the adjacent lines and secure  the knot.  [Figure F]  Repeat with the cascade.  

11.	 Finger-trap the running end of the lines and sew with  either a zigzag or bar tack.  [Figure G]  

![](images/6e66e5dcfeaf46be86812c28c123deb22aa8ab8ab83676b2dc65be75a1799850.jpg)  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the length of the main line and the cascade line  under tension against adjacent lines.

 •	 Check stitching such as zigzag or bar tacks.

 •	 Check line continuity.  

# Square Canopy—Control Line Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Square main canopies •	 Description: Replacement of the control line  assemblies on square main canopies •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; suspension  line—type and color to match. Most control line  assemblies utilize two or more types of line: one for  the upper control lines and a stronger one for the lower  control lines. •	 Machines: 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI and  1 inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper, marking pencil,  6-inch ruler, tape measure, and small safety pins with  marker flags  

# Procedure  

Some manufacturers provide line measurements for their  canopies in their owner’s manuals. If so, the rigger should  thoroughly measure the control line assembly and compare  the measurements against those in the manual. Over time and  use, the control lines have a tendency to stretch and change  dimensions. At the same time, the rigger needs to compare  the right and left side assemblies against each other for any  differences. It is not uncommon for the left and right control  lines to be different lengths, having been changed to remove a  slight turn or change the opening characteristics.  Figure  $A$    is  a sample chart that the rigger can fill in to document the  various dimensions needed to repair or replace control lines.  

Disassembly  

1.	 After measuring the control lines, remove them from  one side only. Leave the other side for a reference to  check the new lines against both for measurements  and construction.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Determine how many upper control lines there are  on the canopy. Four is the most common and this  procedure uses this number for the example. With four  upper control lines, there are really two continuous  lines forming the assembly. Each pair of upper lines  is folded in the middle to form two legs of the upper  assembly. Each line is therefore measured at twice  the A dimension plus 12 inches. If the upper control  lines have different lengths, make sure to use the  longest measurement to determine the cut length for  A.  [Figure A]  

![](images/969bc0d7513c4a64111f9a520a6986659b18a6d3997ee1159e0d3831127c6808.jpg)  
2.	 Using a finger-trapping needle or wire, finger-trap a  loop at the center of each of the lines so the result is a  line with a loop at the center with two legs extending  from it.  [Figure  $B J$   The eye of the loop should be no  more than .25 inch with the fingertrapped portion 1 inch  long. Bar tack or zigzag the finger-trapped section.  

![](images/d668c763464ea176d6be7523cf9a8f9fe339a5703f4a691e460fa67c4ededbca.jpg)  

3.	 There are two types of lower control line configurations:  a continuous line and a non-continuous line. The  continuous line is one piece with a brake loop  finger-trapped into it at the proper location. The non- continuous line consists of two pieces that form the  upper lower and lower lower control line, as well as  the brake loop. The continuous line configuration is  found primarily on the older generation main canopies  and on many of today’s reserve canopies. The non- continuous configuration is found on most of the  modern main canopies due to the ease of replacement  because of wear.  

# Continuous Line Method  

1.	 Take a piece of line used for the lower control line and  cut a line equal to the B dimension in  Figure A  plus 12  inches. On this line, measure from one end 8 inches  plus the C dimension from  Figure A  and mark at that  location. This will be the bottom of the brake loop.  Mark the brake loop location according to  Figure  $C$  .  

![](images/9744ef354d17d39754b057bb1cc0158588167f246341ec89effa8fd52448b612.jpg)  

2.	 Take another piece of the lower brake loop line  approximately 12 inches long. Finger-trap the brake  loop assembly according to  Figure D . Make sure the  ends are scissor cut and tapered. Bar tack or zigzag  the assembly.  [Figure E]  

![](images/a1b3acb57ae326c7ccc9ee16f32f1a519c0b490668faf10384c7c70fd916e56f.jpg)  

3.	 Measure and mark the C dimension from the  bottom of the brake loop. Run the bitter end of the  lower control line thru the eyes of two of the upper  control lines and finger-trap the line back into  itself.  [Figure F]  Adjust the finger-trap to allow  for shrinkage. This completes the continuous line  method of lower control line fabrication.  

# Non-continuous Line Method  

1.	 Take a piece of line used for the lower control line  and cut it at the C dimension from  Figure A  plus 12  inches. Mark at 6 inches from one end and finger-trap  a loop .5–1 inch long as per  Figure   $G$  .  

![](images/1e058db567d23b6a3b1cca88aa555fc08f1451dbd5e02810432bb918c9808f61.jpg)  

2.	 Take a second piece of control line material and cut  it to the D dimension from  Figure A  plus 12 inches  additional. Mark at 6 inches from one end.  

3.	 Finger-trap this line thru the loop at the end of  the upper lower control line. Make sure there is a  minimum of 4 inches finger-trapped in the line and  that the lower loop is tight against the upper loop.  

4.	 Bar tack or zigzag the finger-trapped portions to secure  them.  [Figure H]  

![](images/df4c21a46abcc1602b489eb5520ee27d59c315b3aa54c2afdc6090f8fe0a4831.jpg)  

5.	 Measure and mark the C dimension from the bottom  of the brake loop. Run the bitter end of the lower  control line thru the eyes of two of the upper control  lines and finger-trap the line back into itself. Adjust  the finger-trap to allow for shrinkage. This completes  the non-continuous line method of lower control  line fabrication.  

6.	 Measure the upper control lines according to  dimension A plus .5 inch. If the upper control lines  are of uneven dimensions, make sure that they are  marked accordingly.  

7.	 Lay the canopy on the floor with the trailing edge flat  and straight and the line attachment tabs exposed. Lay  the upper control lines so that they run to the correct  attachment points and route them through the tabs.  [Figure I]  

![](images/10efa24676618527fc4eb3c3972cae319bce5efa8a918248463905aeaa24cfc1.jpg)  

8.	 Make sure that the lines do not have a twist in them  and finger-trap the lines back into themselves with a  minimum of a 4 inches finger-trap. Leave the running  ends exposed.  [Figure J]  Do not trim the excess line.  

![](images/94fb5a1f1f497336515a28bdfebab83ae535a4e291bb1752731c2d37fb4b416e.jpg)  

9.	 Anchor the brake loop securely and apply tension  through the complete control line assembly. Measure  the dimension A plus B starting at the outside corner of  the trailing edge. Adjust the tension of the finger-trap  to allow for shrinkage. Pin the finger-trapped section  with a marker flag.  [Figure K]  Repeat with each upper  control line until complete.  

![](images/019a93727d6b17838958104a41beb01a499cf6eef9372ba1dee302992056f6cc.jpg)  

10.	 After setting the dimension for each upper control  line, bar tack or zigzag each section. Trim the excess  so that the end retreats into the line.  

11.	 Measure the dimension D on the lower control line to  set the toggle location.  [Figure L]  If the canopy is on  risers, route the lower control line thru the guide ring  and tie the steering toggle in place.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check finished dimensions against original dimensions  according to  Figure A .

 •	 Check that all finger-trapped junctions are secured  with either a bar tack or zigzag.  

![](images/d52941fd3dd69ba6863c77a8c8e8c2eb4ed5aee509f8f44fb038bed7f5fddb26.jpg)  

•	 Make sure that there are no twists in the lines.  

•	 Check that the steering toggles (if used) are tied  on securely.  

# Square Canopy—Crossport Repair  

•	 Applicable products: Square main canopies with  crossports •	 Description: Repair of damaged crossports in square  main canopies •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; fabric—type and  color to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, pin board, straight pins, patching  triangle, and hot knife  

# Procedure  

There is no limit as to how many crossports may be repaired  on a main canopy. Reserve canopies are another matter.  The number and authority to repair crossports on a reserve  varies between manufacturers. Before attempting to repair  the crossports of a reserve, first check with the manufacturer.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Many times, when the crossport is damaged, there is  extensive gathering and distortion of the fabric. Before  progressing, smooth out the fabric to reshape the rib  as close as possible to its original shape.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 The basic idea of the crossport repair is a three-sided  patch sewn the same as a standard French fell seam  patch. The fourth side is open and re-cut to the shape  of the crossport.  [Figure A]  However, if the damage  

is extensive enough, it may be advisable to patch the  complete crossport area and then re-cut the crossport  in its original shape with a hot knife.  

![](images/d5f8a28394ebc01d91b9758164334ece89f02bd102a67bb3f38a5ff34d327e20.jpg)  

2.	 Pin the rib to the pin board.  

3.	 Mark out the damaged area as you would a standard  patch. Lay the patch material in place and pin.

 4.	 Sew the patch in place with a seam   $\%$   inch from  the edge.

 5.	 Turn the patch over, fold the seam, and sew as a  standard patch.  [Figure B]  

![](images/d85fb628c9b0520770a25fc7053b9dee14dcdd30c10a937028565945db1a3820.jpg)  

6.	 Lay the repaired rib on a suitable surface and re-cut  the crossport shape in the exposed edge of the patch  material with the hot knife.  [Figure C]  

# Inspection  

•	 Verify the seams of the patch are even and thread  tension is correct.

 •	 Hot knifed edge of the crossport must be smooth  and even.

# Square Canopy—Trim Check and Re-trim  

•	 Applicable products: Square main canopies •	 Description: Re-trimming the suspension lines of main  canopies to return to the original trim specs •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread •	 Machines: 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI or 1  inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, 25-foot tape measure, and  pony clamp  

# Procedure  

Checking and re-trimming main canopies is a common  requirement for riggers. All canopies and all kinds of  suspension lines get out of trim in time with use. The rigger  that knows how to quickly check the trim on a customer’s  canopy, and then determine how much work it takes to return  it to the original configuration is performing a valuable  service. In most cases, as long as the suspension lines are  in good condition, re-trimming a canopy adds hundreds of  jumps to the life of the canopy and returns the performance  to almost as good as new. The chart shown in  Figure A  is  tailored to apply to normal ram-air canopies. Certain designs,  such as elliptical canopies, may have nonstandard trim  measurements that require more detailed measurements. The  rigger should consult the manufacturer’s manuals or technical  data for these canopies.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 The first thing the rigger must do is to complete a  measurement of the lines of the canopy. The chart  in  Figure A  shows a matrix for measuring the lines  of the canopy. Simply fill in the boxes for each  dimension measured. 2.	 Start by laying the canopy on the left side, anchor  the connector links, and flake it out as if for packing.  Most canopy lines are measured from the inside of  the connector links, which is called the zero point. 3.	 Anchor the end of the tape measure even with the zero  mark at the end of the lines using the pony clamp.  [Figure B]  

![](images/4a1945b3ee28eb11f27d744ee3dd7f8c112c30bf54b826f534fa53f4cacd320a.jpg)  

4.	 Start with the top outside right front corner line of the  canopy. This line will be line 1A. Depending on the  number of cells to the canopy, on a 7-cell canopy, the  left corner line will be line 8A. On a 9-cell canopy,  this line will be line 10A. Make sure that the canopy  is oriented correctly so that the measurement sequence  follows the boxes on the chart.  

![](images/f844ab19a8b6c4fd92eab0759d2b8d5e7a8d296b7d745700ba74f2ae97c0bf6f.jpg)  

5.	 Measure all the A lines first and then proceed to the B,  C, and D line groups. The lines should be measured  under approximately 10 pounds of tension. As the  rigger moves through the lines and changes riser  groups, the end of the tape measure should be moved  to the corresponding connector link and re-clamped.  

6.	 Measure the control line groups and fill in the boxes.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Compare the measurements to the original line lengths  as in the manual.  

2.	 Depending on the type of canopy and type of line  used, most canopies tend to have the center A lines  stretch due to the load on opening. The outside lines  that attach to the stabilizers and the control lines tend  to shrink due to the friction generated by the slider  on opening. The key concept to remember is that  the length of the lines is not the critical dimension.  What is most important is the trim differential, which  determines the angle of attack of the canopy. The trim  differential is the difference in the line length between  the A, B, C, and D lines. The most accurate method  of measuring this is to use the A lines as the base  dimension and then measure A-B, A-C, and A-D. This  method takes into consideration the tolerance allowed.  This dimension is what makes the canopy open and  fly correctly. If the overall length of the lines is 2–3  inches longer or shorter, but the trim is correct, there  is probably no appreciable effect on the canopy. With  this in mind, it may be desirable to “shortline” the  canopy during the trim process in order to not have  to replace any main lines.  

3.	 Because of the fact that the cascaded main lines may  stretch at different rates, the adjustment to be made  to the lines that have stretched (i.e., gotten longer)  needs to be done at the canopy end and not at the  connector link.  

4.	 Remove the bar tacks or zigzag stitching at the canopy  end of the lines.  

5.	 Adjust the line length as needed to return to the  original dimensions. Re-tie the knots or finger-trap  as necessary and re-sew as per the original.  

6.	 For the lines that may have shrunk in length, it may  be possible to gain as much as 2–3 inches of line  adjustment by utilizing the extra line that is finger- trapped into each line attachment point. Depending  on the type of line used on the canopy, the amount of  excess line finger-trapped may vary. Dacron lines can  have as little as 2–3 inches inserted into the finger- trap and hold securely. The smaller and more slippery  Spectra ®  line is recommended to have at least 6 inches  of line inserted into the finger-trap. So, depending on  the amount of line that is needed to be gained for the  trim adjustment, the rigger may be able to adjust each  end of the line to gain the necessary adjustment.  

7.	 If this needed line can be gained, remove the bar tacks or  zigzag at each end of the line and reattach after adjusting  the length. Before permanently attaching, the rigger  should simply tie the lines in place and check the trim.  If everything is within limits, then re-tie or finger-trap  and re-stitch with bar tacks or zigzag as per the original.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check final trim dimensions against original •	 Check continuity so there are no twists or crossed lines •	 Verify all junctions are either knotted or finger-trapped  and sewn as per the original  

# Section 2, Container  

Container repairs share some techniques with canopy repairs,  such as single-side patches. Most repairs, however, involve  replacement of panels or flaps, Velcro ® , grommets, plastic  stiffeners, worn binding tape, and broken hand tackings.  Even more so than canopy repairs, the cosmetic results of the  container repair are most important to the customer and, thus,  the rigger. A shoddy repair to the container is immediately  obvious each time the user puts on the parachute. Even if it is  functional, it has to look good to instill confidence in the user.  

The following are repairs found in Section 2, Container:  

•	 Container fabric panel repair •	 Container grommet replacement •	 Container Velcro ®  replacement •	 Container plastic stiffener replacement •	 Main container side flap replacement •	 Bottom of container (BOC) pocket replacement •	 3-ring release housing replacement  

# Container Fabric Panel Repair  

•	 Applicable products: All types of parachute container  systems. •	 Description: Application of a patch repair to container  panels. •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; fabric—type  and color to match; nylon tapes—assorted types and  widths, such as Type-3, Type-4, or Type-12  

•	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI  

•	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, hot knife, hot glue gun, butane  lighter, ripstop tape (optional), and straight pins  

# Procedure  

Besides holding the canopy, the container’s main function  is to protect the canopy from damage. To that end, a certain  amount of wear and damage is to be expected. The most  common repairs involve re-stitching broken threads and  binding tape repairs. Other damage involves tears, punctures,  and fabric abrasion. The appropriate repair varies according  to need. There are five primary repair procedures to basic  panel repairs: re-stitching, binding tape repair, hidden  patches, overlay patches, and single-side fabric patches.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove all extraneous parts from the container,  including canopies, handles, toggles, etc. 2.	 Inspect the damaged area to determine which repair  method is appropriate.  

Reassembly  

Restitching  

1.	 Using the same type and color of thread, sew directly  over the original stitching. The amount of overstitch  may vary according to location. If the affected area  is completely exposed and accessible, overstitch the  ends of the damaged area a minimum of 1.25 inches.  If this is not possible, then backstitch a minimum of  3 stitches to lock the ends. Repair complete.  

# Binding Tape Repair or Splice  

1.	 Many times the binding tape is worn through  due to bridle abrasion or other wear patterns.  [Figure A]  Rather than remove the panel and rebind  it, a practical and cost effective repair is to overlay a  section of new binding over the damaged area. 2.	 Cut a piece of binding tape a minimum of 1 inch longer  than the damaged area. Scissor cut the tape and then  lightly sear with the butane lighter.  [Figure  $B J$   If the  tape is cut with a hot knife and then folded, the cut  edge cracks at the hot-knifed end. Searing with the  lighter results in a more flexible end. Fold the tape  in half lengthwise to form a crease. Take a marking  pencil and mark the crease.  [Figure C] 3.	 Overlay the new tape over the damaged area and mark  the start of where the new tape begins and covers the  damaged area completely.  [Figure D]

4.	 Overstitch the original tape on the inside row up to the  point where the new tape is to start. Leave the needle  in the material. Place the folded tape over the damaged  area and hold tightly in place. Make sure that the edge  is pushed up against the original and the end is against  the needle.  [Figure E]  The next stitch should catch  the new tape.

5.	 Stitch the new piece and overstitch the end a minimum  of 1.25 inches or 3 stitches. Repeat with the outside  row of stitches. Repair complete.  

# Hidden Patches  

This type of repair has never had a name, but it is self- descriptive. It works well on tears and punctures. Done  properly, it is a very cosmetic and cost effective repair.  

1.	 Take a piece of adhesive tape and place on the outside of  the damaged area to hold the edges together.  [Figure F] 2.	 Turn the panel inside out, take the glue gun and glue  a small piece of Type-3 tape 1 inch longer over the  damaged area.  [Figure G]  Do not fold the ends under.  Remove the adhesive tape from the outside. 3.	 Stitch around the outer perimeter of the Type-3 tape  using matching colored thread to the container fabric.  If necessary, increase the upper thread tension so that  the outside (bottom) thread shows good tension. 4.	 Take the zigzag machine, again with matching color  thread, and set the stitch width to its widest setting  and 7–11 SPI length. Overstitch the exposed edges  of the cut area to draw them together.  [Figure H] Repair complete.  

![](images/d8b82df7875c82152ec6f62350964e5dccb4668c7f732108599a3dc447ecb3f0.jpg)  

# Overlay Patches  

These are similar to a fabric patch but use a piece of tape or  webbing to cover the damaged area. In effect, it is the same  as the hidden patch but usually larger and is on the outside  of the panel. It is a sturdy patch but not very cosmetic.  

1.	 Using a hot knife, cut a piece of tape or webbing, such  as Type-12, big enough to cover the damaged area.  Allow enough to fold the cut ends under. Fold the ends  under and glue down to itself.  [Figure I]  

![](images/70d3511da83f7f2351093fb13308dd37032ba279ce70facb370a0794991c4bc0.jpg)  
2.	 Lay the patch in place over the damaged area and mark  the corners with a marking pencil.  [Figure J]  

![](images/e5d71fb7407aa7fce7d3384872ed007ed67a2c8428ea39f2587dd49ea1bfbece.jpg)  
3.	 Take a straight pin and transfer the corners of the patch  area through to the inside.  [Figure K]  

![](images/ccfa3de42134b24be427f09cfd182b89a361231fcd5afb38d29df42de63fa1ce.jpg)  

4.	 If on a main container, take a piece of Type-3 tape big  enough to match the outside patch as marked. Cover  the inside of the damaged area with the tape. 5.	 Pin or glue the tape patch to the inside as marked. Use  the single needle to sew around the patch overstitching  the ends a minimum of 1 inch. 6.	 Take the zigzag machine and stitch the edges of the  damaged area together as described in step 4, Hidden  Patches.  [Figure L]  Repair complete.  

![](images/e6333b0a68e581cdfec2a59c6a3f3e14a207226ce3756513b8f4e6fb416b32e3.jpg)  

# Single-Side Fabric Patches  

For most fabric patches on a container panel, there is not  enough area to perform a proper French fell seam patch.  Consequently, the single-side patch is the most common  technique used. By using matching fabric and thread, a large  damaged area may be covered to affect the necessary repair.  While called a single-side patch, in effect it is an enlarged  version of the overlay patch. A smaller piece of webbing or  fabric is used to cover the damaged area on the inside and the  outside is covered with the single-side patch. This technique  is used where there may be large holes or widespread damage  and replacement of the panel is not practical.  

1.	 Duplicate steps 1–5 that was used in the “Overlay  Patches” section above but substitute webbing for  the inside patch and use container fabric for the  outside patch. 2.	 Fold the edges of the outside patch under a minimum  of .5 inch. Stitch around the perimeter approximately  .12 inch from the edge. Run a second row of stitches  approximately .25 inch inside and parallel to the  first.  [Figure M]  This gives added strength to the  patch and an appearance of a French fell seam patch.  Repair complete.

# Inspection  

•	 Check thread tensions, stitches per inch, and overstitch  lengths. •	 Damaged area must be covered completely. •	 For the overlay and single-side patches, make sure  the stitch patterns catch both sides of the patch  materials completely.  

# Container Grommet Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: All types of containers that use  grommets •	 Description: Replacement of damaged grommets of  all types •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; grommets—size,  type, and material to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6 inch ruler, grommet die set—size to match  grommets, leather mallet, grommet cutting board, hole  punch to match grommet size, basting tip (optional),  and diagonal wire cutters—8 inch minimum  

# Procedure  

There are many types of grommets used in parachute container  manufacture. Older style military surplus containers used flat  grommets made of brass with a chrome finish, which were  designed to work with cones. Most modern container systems  use rolled rim spur grommets and washers. The most common  size is the “O.” For many years, regular brass grommets were  used and then nickel plated ones became the norm. In recent  years, stainless steel has come to be the preferred type due  to the ability to resist deformation and corrosion. Today,  there are two types of “O” stainless grommets. The first is  the regular or “short shank.” Recently, a long shank version  has become available. It has proven to be very versatile and  popular. This repair procedure focuses primarily on the “O”  spur grommet and washer, but the technique can be applied  to all types of grommets.  

Disassembly—Grommet Replacement  

This is for replacing a damaged grommet or changing  from brass to stainless steel. Use the cutters to remove the  grommet. If the grommet is set into a fabric/webbing base,  fold the material back to expose the washer. Using the  diagonal cutter, cut through the washer and then peel it back  from the grommet.  [Figures A  and  B]  Grasp the grommet  and peel it from the material.

Reassembly—Grommet Replacement  

If the hole is intact and undamaged, simply insert the  replacement grommet into the material from the correct side,  and set with the grommet die. Make sure that the grommet  is set sufficiently so that there is no exposed edge to snag  lines or material.  

# Material Repair and Grommet Replacement  

If, after removing the grommet, the fabric is damaged so that  the grommet cannot be set properly, use the zigzag machine  to stitch around the perimeter of the hole, reducing its size.  [Figure C]  

![](images/5904dedb98ec54a0ad1ccf48f5a9f334892b43550dcd2d945b237859988ef366.jpg)  

1.	 Take the basting tip and pass it through the hole,  searing the material.  [Figure D]  This solidifies the  frayed and raw edge of the damaged material.  

![](images/64d75e61ea7f8b5374ec5d630aee90f3f81e840bbecf0c1a9d935aa3ad9bfcbb.jpg)  

2.	 Set the grommet in the repaired hole.  [Figure E]  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the grommet orientation. •	 Grommet must be set tightly. •	 There should be no sharp edges on inside of grommet.  

# Container Velcro ®  Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most parachute assemblies that  use Velcro ®  

![](images/0174525f6958d45aae2e2033289b267663fcb002340d26c6efc32bab03824b15.jpg)  

•	 Description: Main riser cover Velcro ®  replacement •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; Velcro ® —color,  width, and type to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, and 6-inch ruler  

# Procedure  

The name Velcro ®  is a trade name for what is known as  “pressure sensitive hook and loop fastener.” It is a commonly  used material for closure systems. Before the advent of  Velcro ® , snaps and zippers were the preferred method of  closing containers. Velcro ®  changed how the parachute  industry designed products. In the late 1970s and early  1980s, there was a tendency to overdo the use of Velcro ®  and  problems with durability and interaction with other materials  became known. Since then, the use of Velcro ®  has been  reduced to those applications where it is superior to other  methods and can be easily replaced.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Identify the nature of the use of the Velcro ® . Before  you remove the piece, note how it is attached to the  container. Some designs are such that several layers of  construction have to be reversed to get to the location  where the Velcro ®  was sewn on. If this is the case,  the rigger may have to make a very expensive repair  to replace a small piece of Velcro ® .  

Reassembly  

1.	 Cut the replacement Velcro ®  to size. Velcro ®  is  normally scissor cut, not cut with a hot knife.  

2.	 Position the Velcro ®  and stitch around the perimeter  at .12 inch from the edge. For any pieces, 1 inch in  width or wider, sew a row of stitching down the center.  [Figure A]  This prevents the center from being pulled  up from the material and loading the outside row of  stitching.  [Figure B]  

![](images/2cbfe7459ee20e303f52735cd9636857bbcdfb4712100cecfffc683b9ebee0ca.jpg)  

3.	 Some applications have the Velcro ®  sewn to a piece  of tape for support. Again, if it is 1 inch or more wide,  sew down the center to prevent lifting.  

4.	 Depending on the application, the mating loop piece  of Velcro ®  may be wider than the hook to provide  additional protection. That is, the hook may be .75  inch wide and the loop 1 inch wide.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check that thread tension is correct.

 •	 Verify orientation is correct.

 •	 Check that center stitching is used where needed.  

# Container Plastic Stiffener Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: All types of containers that use  plastic stiffeners  

•	 Description: Replacement of damaged plastic  stiffeners of all types •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; grommets—size,  type, and material to match; and plastic stiffeners— type and thickness to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–9 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, grommet die set—size to match  grommets, leather mallet, grommet cutting board, hole  punch to match grommet size, basting tip, diagonal  wire cutters—8 inch minimum, heavy shears or tin  snips, electric drill and   $\%$   inch drill bit, and feeler  gauge—.010 inch  

# Procedure  

The term “plastic,” when used in conjunction for the materials  used as stiffeners in modern parachute containers, is a  misnomer. In reality, the composition of the material varies.  The most common material used today is molydisulfide  (MDS) nylon. In addition, Lexan ® , a clear polycarbonate  material and high density polyethelyne (HDPE), are also used.  The most common thicknesses used are .025 inch, .040 inch,  and .060 inch, which are standard commercial thicknesses  commonly available. Stiffeners are used primarily as backing  for grommets to spread the load placed on closing flaps.  Instead of focusing the load on the diameter of the grommet,  it is spread out across the length of the stiffener, resulting in a  smoother flap and container. Consequently, replacing plastic  stiffeners almost always requires replacing the grommet as  well. Usually the plastic breaks at the grommet location  because the hole for the grommet is the weak point. The  following procedure shows the replacement of the bottom  main flap stiffener of a Javelin container.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Unpick the stitching that holds the binding tape to the  bottom flap.  [Figure A]  Remove the grommet. 2.	 Remove the stitching that holds the stiffener in  position. Remove the stiffener.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Use the original stiffener as a template to cut a  new stiffener.  [Figure B]  While many of the older  containers use HDPE or other materials, most of the  newer designs use MDS nylon because of its superior  properties. Because of this, many riggers use MDS  exclusively for replacing any stiffeners.  

![](images/f279043d3bc6861ab70bac50bee5b32a9d88c3d638c2105495be41fbfacfb260.jpg)  

2.	 Mark out the outline of the original stiffener on the  MDS. Mark the center of the hole for the grommet  very precisely.  

3.	 Use the basting tip to mark the center of the hole for  the grommet. Push the tip through the MDS until the  shoulder of the tip makes an indentation in the MDS.  [Figures C,   $D$  ,  and    $E J$    This forms a pilot hole for  the drill.  

4.	 Using heavy shears or tin snips, cut the MDS nylon to  shape. Clip the corners to remove the sharp ends and, if  the edges are sharp or rough, sand them with sandpaper.  

5.	 Secure the MDS against a piece of wood and drill a  $\%$  inch hole. While this hole may seem big for the shank  of the grommet, when installed and the material is  punched, it will be the right size. A common mistake  is to make the hole too small and when the grommet  is set, it cracks the plastic.  

6.	 Insert the stiffener in between the layers of fabric of  the bottom flap and let it float inside.  

7.	 Baste the two layers of fabric together with the  single needle.  

![](images/4a7ffb6d1165c94e736de18b92e68e48a878327549068ef475a04b22c7246c5b.jpg)  

8.	 Restitch the binding to the bottom flap.  [Figure F]  

9.	 Slide the stiffener to the edge of the flap and align the  hole in the stiffener with the hole in the fabric. Use an  “O” grommet to align the holes.  [Figure G]  

10.	 Stitch the stiffener in place as per the original  installation.  

![](images/d0ea68b15eb614f98f2467a1e5484b33eb64351a5e1a761b83f32697fc7cbe56.jpg)  

11.	 Insert the grommet with the correct orientation and  set with the grommet set.  [Figure H]  Make sure that  the grommet is set sufficiently so there is no exposed  edge to snag the lines or material. Use the feeler gauge  to check the gap under the edge of the grommet.  [Figure I]  It should be no more than .010 inch. If  more, hit the set again to tighten the grommet.  

![](images/3441ee7daa802a649315c9ecb77efe54dcaa6e18cd29192b29b5187ffbfe1639.jpg)

Inspection  

•	 Verify the stiffener backing is re-sewn. •	 Check the grommet orientation. •	 The grommet must be set tightly and measured. •	 There should be no sharp edges on the inside of the  grommet.  

# Main Container Side Flap Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most modern container systems •	 Description: Replacement of a main container side flap •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; Type  $\cdot3\%$   inch  tape—color to match, replacement flap •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 5–9  SPI, 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, 301 double  needle with tape folder 5–9 SPI, and 1 inch  $\times\,42$   stitch  bar tack •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, and hot knife  

# Procedure  

The following technique is typical of many modern container  systems. This procedure addresses only the disassembly of  the container and replacement of the factory made part. It  does not address the manufacture of a replacement part.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove all extraneous parts from the harness/ container assembly. 2.	 Open the bottom corner of the main container on the  appropriate side.  

3.	 It is necessary to remove the Type-3 binding tape  on the inside seam joining the main body to the  side flap. Depending on the container construction  configuration, there are two options how to do this:  

•	 Option 1: salvage method. With this method, the  binding tape is left undamaged and sewn back in  place after replacing the flap. A slower method,  but good if the rigger does not have the necessary  replacement tape. •	 Using a seam ripper, unpick the two rows of  stitching that holds the side flap to the main  container.  [Figure A]  Start at the lower  corner and continue until approximately  2 inches past where the side flap joins the  riser cover.  

![](images/e05d9bc147badb1713579ada15d670911c043db0f97fc103b7ff0b26ecd4c411.jpg)  

# •	 Remove the side flap.  

•	 Option 2: replacement tape method. With this  method, the binding tape is destroyed during the  removal process and replaced with new. A faster  method, but new tape is required.  

•	 Use a hot knife to melt the stitching that holds  the binding tape that attaches the side flap to  the main container.  [Figure B]  When doing  this, have the side of the tape that faces the  damaged side flap facing up in case you slip  so the wrong flap is not damaged. Proceed  to the point where the side flap stops. Trim  the melted tape at this point. •	 Using a seam ripper, unpick the tape  approximately 2 inches past the end of the  side flap. Remove the side flap.  

![](images/fcee3c5fd234e7b6d14790346668aad75d9a73f8ff37bf39c39fb487e5ca877d.jpg)  

corner.  [Figure C]  On this design and others like it,  the lower end of the main riser cover is unstitched  during removal of the main flap. When sewing the  new flap in place, make sure that the side flap is sewn  to the main container first and then the riser cover on  top of it. Look at the opposite side to see which is on  top and duplicate.  

![](images/39231f6f528a16ec812fd6c9029844d55c9312331577883a9b10f94238210345.jpg)  

2.	 If option 1 was used, take the original binding tape,  fold over the seam and sew in place with two rows of  stitching. Note that there is a second row of stitching  sewn directly on top of the inside row of stitching for  reinforcement.  [Figure D]  This is very important.  

3.	 If option 2 was used, it is necessary to replace the  binding tape with new. Stitch down the loose end of  the binding tape at the top and then overlap the tape  by approximately 2 inches using the double needle  machine and tape binder.  [Figure   $E J$   Overstitch the  inside row for reinforcement.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Take the new flap and sew it in place on the main  container starting approximately .38 inch from the  

![](images/cddf3af1ddaab463618831d7263421256b285e12adc08a9d0d577055ce9882df.jpg)

6.	 Close the bottom of the container as per the original  and reinforce as required.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check that the flap is installed correct side out.

 •	 Check the inside binding for reinforcing stitching.

 •	 The side flap/riser cover should be stitched and  reinforced.  

•	 The container bottom must be closed correctly  and reinforced.  

# Bottom of Container (BOC) Pocket Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Any main container with a BOC  pocket configuration •	 Description: Installation of a BOC pocket to the  main container •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–9 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, and t-pins  

# Procedure  

The following technique is typical of many modern container  systems. This procedure addresses only the disassembly of  the container and replacement of a factory made replacement  part. It does not address the manufacture of a replacement  part. Depending on the size of the container assembly, it may  be possible to do the replacement of the BOC pocket with the  reserve packed. However, the smaller the system, the more  difficult it will be. If the container cannot be placed under  the machine, then remove the reserve canopy.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Mark the location of the corners of the BOC pocket  on the container with a marking pencil. 2.	 Open the lower right corner of the main container.  [Figure A]  

![](images/a5e93364840fb12b86e05006a953e7aac10e35c30ac7e167f27be0b85306246d.jpg)  

3.	 Remove the old BOC pocket.  

1.	 Locate the new BOC pocket on the container at the  marks of the old pocket and pin in place with T-pins.  [Figure B]  

![](images/9696a509557d38c0ba85fccc21885a52c1da0b51314818c9b338b406080a40eb.jpg)  

2.	 Stitch around the perimeter of the pocket with the  single-needle machine. Backstitch at the corners for  reinforcing.  [Figure C]  

![](images/25e3b78d7e869f68edac7d7158b30c74c71da8bd2ec8cd07174441f5bd8bae60.jpg)  

3.	 Restitch the corner of the main container as per the  original configuration.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the orientation of the pocket with the opening  to the right (unless for left-handed deployment).

 •	 Check the stitching and corner reinforcing.  

# Ring Release Housing Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: All harness and container  systems equipped with a 3-ring release system  

•	 Description: Replacement of damaged or missing  3-ring release housings •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: Nylon supertack, 3-ring housings of the  correct length, heat shrink tubing -  $\%$   inch diameter,  Owner’s Manual for the harness and container  assembly (if available) •	 Machines: None •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, hand tacking needle, heat gun,  crimping tool (optional)  

# Procedure  

Replacement of the 3-ring housings may be necessary due  to wear, damage, or stretching of the housings. Correct  installation and tacking of the housings are important to  ensure proper operation of the 3-ring release system.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Inspect the original installation to determine the exact  routing of the housings. Some systems have dedicated  channels and/or loops through which they are routed.  In others, the housings are routed under or over back  straps or reserve ripcord housings. If necessary, draw  a diagram of the routing or take a picture so that the  replacement housings are routed correctly. 2.	 Remove any tackings or clamps that hold the housings  together and/or to the container. Remove the housings  from the system.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Install the replacement housings into their respective  locations as per the original installation. Usually the  longer housing is installed first and then the shorter one. 2.	 Make sure that the flat side of the housing terminal  end is orientated outward so that it lays flat against  the rear of the main riser when the 3-ring release is  assembled correctly.  [Figure A] 3.	 Align the handle end of the housings and secure as  per the original installation. This may be with either  a double clamp or hand tacking.  [Figure B]   Figure  $C$    shows a typical method of using supertack to secure  the housings together. 4.	 If hand tacking is used, it is desirable to cover the  tacking with heat shrink tubing. Place a length of  tubing over the housing ends and shrink using the heat  gun.  [Figure D]  

![](images/1a38219dd8a6b47cb4d2018a8022160b7006b165af4aa0c93be7b526ff672998.jpg)  
5.	 Secure the double housing to the container/back pad  or pocket assembly. Depending on the manufacturer,  it may be necessary to provide a certain amount of  “float” to the housings in order that the loop of the riser  is not loaded or under tension when the main canopy  is deployed. If available, consult the owner’s manual  for correct positioning and tacking. Some systems use  

![](images/19b5a1fa17e45cb534d4c3cea4307724bd204a185b7c9d612ee23d29b02d892e.jpg)  
a double clamp to secure the housings together, as well  as to the container or pockets. If these are used, inspect  the clamp to make sure that it was not damaged when  removing the housings and can be reused. Crimp the  housings, making sure that the clamp is tight so the  housings cannot work loose.  [Figure E]  

![](images/cfc60facba7162f3c9b6768fa0af637ce13c83271bc0f096c51b82ffecc9979b.jpg)  
6.	 Route the release cables through the housings to make  sure there are no obstructions.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check for correct routing of the housings.

 •	 Verify correct orientation of the terminal ends.

 •	 Housings should be secured together at the handle ends.

 •	 Housings should be secured to the container/back pad  or pockets with either clamps or supertack.

 •	 There should be sufficient slack or “float” in the  housings.

 •	 Housings should be clear.  

# Section 3, Harness and Risers  

Harness repairs are almost always a major repair.  Consequently, they are master rigger work. About the only  repairs open to a senior rigger are replacement of ripcord  pockets and Velcro ® ; and replacement of hand tackings for  ripcords, comfort pads, 3-ring housings, and other hardware.  Major harness repairs are the most critical maintenance  operations a rigger can perform on a parachute assembly.  Even seemingly innocuous repairs, if done incorrectly, can  have fatal consequences. Depending on the type of harness  design, repairs to the harness main lift web or leg straps  involve major repair or remanufacture.  

According to 14 CFR part 65, section 65.129 (e) and (f), “No  certificated parachute rigger may – (e) Pack, maintain, or  alter a parachute in any manner that deviates from procedures  approved by the Administrator or the manufacturer of the  parachute; or (f) Exercise the privileges of his certificate and  type rating unless he understands the current manufacturer’s  instructions for the operation involved...” In other words,  because this operation is a major repair, the person doing  the work must be a currently certificated Master Parachute  Rigger  with the appropriate ratings.  

In the past, many master riggers felt that they were  empowered to undertake almost any task. The attitude was,  “We can lift the TSO label, build a new harness, and put the  TSO label back on.” This is not the case. Just because an  individual has a master rigger license does not mean he or  she is qualified to undertake a complex repair.  

There are four primary areas of concern that need to be  addressed in any repair program. They are as follows:  

1.	 Inspection, damage identification, and repair planning 2.	 Teardown and cleanup 3.	 Preparation and reconstruction 4.	 Quality control inspection and recordkeeping  

Main risers are components that are subject to extreme wear  and tear. The only items that are practical for repair are  the 3-ring locking loops and the toggle mounting/Velcro ® assembly. Once the webbing begins to show wear, it is more  practical to replace than repair them.  

The following are repairs found in Section 3, Harness  and Risers:  

•	 Chest strap replacement •	 Lower leg strap shortening •	 Ripcord pocket Velcro ®  replacement •	 Articulated upper leg hardware replacement  

•	 Standard harness main lift web replacement •	 Main riser 3-ring locking loop replacement •	 Main riser steering toggle Velcro ®  replacement  

# Chest Strap Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most standard harness  configurations •	 Description: Replacement of chest strap due to damage  or for lengthening •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—5-cord nylon thread •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, heavy-duty harness machine—Singer 7–33 or  equivalent-stitch length to match the original, and 308  zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, ruler, hot glue gun, and hot knife  

# Procedure  

This procedure deals with the longer side of the chest strap,  usually the left, which is threaded through the chest adapter  or through an adjustable V-ring. Replacing the opposite side  would mirror this process.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Examine the chest strap/MLW junction to determine  if the backpad needs to be removed from the harness  to access the junction. If so, remove the pad from the  harness to allow access to the junction.  [Figure A]  

![](images/dc69c1d188ca2080da36fe5ca6ecd22859c2d8d8183039f003f3b1b4531a2f8a.jpg)  

2.	 Many harnesses have the reserve ripcord housing  located on the left side. The housing needs to be  disconnected at this location. It is usually secured to  a loop located at the chest strap junction. During the  

replacement process, this loop is removed and may  be reused if in good condition.  

3.	 Remove the harness stitching and any other stitching  from the junction making sure not to damage the main  lift web.  [Figure B]  

![](images/35edd8f3c6be83f84ed85a9f89890aeb3f78811f529464bd582d4dfc4de4e7ad.jpg)  

4.	 Remove the old chest strap webbing from the main lift  web. Pay particular attention to the end of the webbing.  While most chest straps are installed at right angles to  the main lift web, some have an angle cut at the end  for better fit. If the webbing has an angle, make sure  to duplicate it.  

5.	 Clean the junction area of old thread, as well as any  glue residue on the inside of the main lift web.  

6.	 Take the marking pencil and mark the points of the  stitch pattern for the reassembly.  [Figure C]  Most  chest straps are installed with a 3-point WW in a  horizontal orientation, but the rigger should duplicate  the original design.  

![](images/ee05f8ace69cd4297406da69a77144bc5d0831ee9cb6a5cc9fc0e76880bcd4dc.jpg)  

7.	 If the procedure is a replacement of a damaged chest  strap, then it should be replaced to the original length.  If so, then remove the rolled stop end so that the  finished length may be determined. If the chest strap  is to be lengthened, then an appropriate length of  webbing needs to be determined. The finished length  should be measured from the outside of the main lift  web plus 3.50 inches.  [Figure D]  

![](images/9f531adbc027f952d0f84317acb1596673973c9214d6468b0d83050be5b9f466.jpg)  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a piece of webbing to the appropriate length. If  needed, cut the MLW end of the strap at an angle.  [Figure E]  

![](images/13062f8458c26d6f3184df6871c6c0073c8bd4ddd5b1c524a8d434a9b305ca07.jpg)  
2.	 Insert the end of the webbing into the MLW junction.  Align the end of the chest strap with the outside edge  of the MLW. Insert the housing loop back into the  junction as well. Lightly glue the MLW to the chest  strap.  [Figure F]  Do not use too much glue.  

![](images/5180a5cee14822b513bd40a214fd8e1022ad8c1d50ffe47cd81ba492df8137a5.jpg)  

3.	 Some harnesses are pre-sewn along the edges  with a medium duty machine and E thread. If so,  duplicate this.  

4.	 Using the harness machine and 5-cord nylon thread,  sew the junction as marked with the original pattern.  [Figure G]  

![](images/791ba7e20f5a8a494e61f0e39276ce2126d41f621e37391e98d6d2a77b77ef64.jpg)  

5.	 Mark the length of the chest strap to include enough  needed for the stop end. If the chest strap is to be  configured for a thread-thru adapter, an additional  3.50 inches is needed for the roll back.  

6.	 After determining the cut length, place a mark at 3.50  inches on the BACK side of the chest strap. Fold to  this mark and then fold the webbing one more time  for three layers.  [Figures H  and  I]  

7.	 Using the zigzag machine, sew across the center of  the stop end fold. This results in a loose fold that jams  against the adapter in the event of slippage of the chest  strap.  [Figure J]  

![](images/cd9c5947f7a70f9606a6fd29114c34fd8e885109d8a3d25a91f7824bb5e4e1f1.jpg)  

![](images/f870616af589b56d13e0dc85caddd42a583477f84d0ae1208f50e0a27f41c035.jpg)  

8.	 If the MLW was attached to the backpad assembly,  reattach as per the original configuration. If the backpad  is attached in such a manner that does not allow  inspection of the back side of the MLW, inspect the  stitching at this time before reattaching the backpad.  

9.	 Reinstall the ripcord housing and secure.  

# Inspection  

•	 Inspect the harness stitching for correct stitch length,  tension, and appropriate pattern. •	 Reattach the MLW to the backpad as needed. •	 The stop end must be sewn and oriented correctly. •	 Verify the chest strap is the correct length. •	 The ripcord housing must be reinstalled and tacked.  

# Lower Leg Strap Shortening  

•	 Applicable products: All harness configurations •	 Description: Shortening of the lower leg straps •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: 5-cord nylon thread—color to match  original •	 Machines: Heavy-duty harness machine—Singer 7–33  or equivalent 5–7 SPI •	 Equipment: Seam ripper or scalpel, marking pencil,  ruler, and hot knife  

# Procedure  

The shortening of the leg strap, while a relatively  straightforward process, is an extremely important procedure.  If done improperly, it could result in the harness fitting  improperly or the leg straps to come unthreaded and the user  to fall out during opening.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 If the leg strap is of the thread-thru configuration,  unthread the webbing from the leg adapter. If the leg  strap has an adjustable “V” ring used in conjunction  with a snap, disconnect the “V” ring from the snap.  Lay the leg strap out flat. 2.	 Remove the harness stitching from the rolled end of  the webbing. 3.	 Measure the required distance from the end of the strap  that is required for shortening and mark accordingly.  [Figure A] 4.	 Trim the webbing at the mark using the hot knife.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 For the thread-thru configuration, place a mark at 3.50  inches from the end of the webbing on the bottom of  the webbing.  [Figure B]  This is the “fold to” mark  for the first fold of the webbing. Fold one more time  for a total of three layers of webbing.  [Figure C]  

![](images/c6239306df1cbc21a5c526c1a003c1b034828efb592c4e85ca8c2bb898b177bf.jpg)  

![](images/01a14e253c9208ab934dc67ba0f3adcc909280237f29d104bbb21611032ed36c.jpg)  

2.	 Sew the rolled stop end according to  Figure  $D$   with  the harness machine.  

3.	 For the “V” ring configuration, place a mark at 2 inches  from the top end of the webbing. This is also the “fold  to” mark for the first fold. Make two additional folds  for a total of four layers.  

![](images/4a45f050c0fa6c10154bbde96fff6ea7528b7e815e35c33430aad610aece2f73.jpg)  
4.	 Sew the rolled stop end according to  Figure  $E$   with  the harness machine.  

![](images/84531a5534676a3927bd66f92fc5b8ba79cc13ce9f95bb3af19622cc82dbab5d.jpg)  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the stitching for the correct pattern and thread  tension.

 •	 For the thread-thru configuration, make sure there is no  twist to the leg strap and thread the webbing through  the leg adapter. The rolled end should face outward.

 •	 For the “V” ring configuration, connect the “V” ring to  the snap. The rolled stop end should also face outward.  

# Ripcord Pocket Velcro ®  Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Any harness configuration with  a Velcro ®  style ripcord pocket configuration

 •	 Description: Replacement of the Velcro ®  of the  ripcord pocket

 •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  

•	 Materials: E thread—color to match original; hook and  loop Velcro ® —width and length to match original •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, and glue gun  

# Procedure  

Disassembly  

1.	 Depending on the configuration, it may be necessary to  remove the ripcord housing from its attachment point  on the harness for access to the pocket. If the harness  is attached to the backpad, disconnect this as well. 2.	 Remove the E thread stitch pattern that forms the  pocket on the MLW.  [Figure A]  

![](images/3e7aa8c7bc54126f63f2371bb3bb9fc288fa75335c9ff332ca93d0f13da1008b.jpg)  

3.	 Mark the ends of the old Velcro ®  and remove from the  inside of the webbing. Note which side of the webbing  the hook and loop are located.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Cut the replacement Velcro ®  to the correct length. 2.	 Glue the Velcro ®  pieces to their respective locations  on the inside of the webbing. 3.	 Using the single needle machine, sew around  the perimeter of the Velcro ® , as well as a row of  stitching down the center.  [Figure B]  Repeat for the  opposite side. 4.	 Re-sew the pocket with two rows of single needle  stitching with E thread.  [Figure C] 5.	 Reattach the harness to the backpad. 6.	 Reinstall the ripcord housing to the harness.  

![](images/978fd9149e38c918f9cece03013ecb68f1ca34436a8ef64d3bb7ef88b71e7dce.jpg)  
Inspection  

•	 Verify the correct orientation of the Velcro ®  in  the pocket.

 •	 The correct stitch pattern must be used for the Velcro ® .

 •	 Verify the ripcord pocket is re-sewn.

 •	 The backpad must be reattached (if needed).

 •	 The ripcord housing must be reinstalled.  

# Articulated Upper Leg Hardware Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most articulated harness  configurations

 •	 Description: Replacement of the upper leg strap  hardware

 •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger 

 •	 Materials: E thread—color to match; 5-cord nylon  thread—color to match; Type-8 webbing—color  to match; Type-12 webbing, Type-4 1-inch tape,  replacement adapter—MS-22040  

•	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, heavy-duty  harness machine—Singer 7–33 or equivalent, stitch  to match the original •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel,  marking pencil, ruler, glue gun, and 4-point W-W  pattern template  

# Procedure  

The following procedure is required when the knurling  on the friction bar has worn to the point that the leg strap  would slip on opening. In addition, the webbing at the ring  location shows wear and is replaced at the same time. This  procedure is typical for a Flexon and Talon 2 articulated  harness configuration.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Remove the leg pad assembly. 2.	 Remove the leg strap by cutting the webbing.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Use  Figure A  to cut a replacement leg strap and parts. 2.	 Take the Ty-8 webbing and sew a bowtie fold with  the Ty-4 tape buffer at the 3.50 inch mark.  [Figure B] 3.	 Turn the adapter upside down and install the Ty-8  webbing as shown and glue in place.  [Figure C] 4.	 Install the bowtie around the ring and glue in place.  [Figure D]  The picture shows the inside orientation  of the harness. 5.	 Double check the correct orientation of the hardware.  [Figure E] 6.	 Mark the stitch pattern.  [Figure F] 7.	 Sew the webbing with the harness machine in a 4-point  W-W pattern  [Figure G] 8.	 Reinstall the leg pad. Route the upper pad flap through  the adapter from the bottom and zigzag.  [Figure H] 9.	 Fold the bottom pad under and zigzag in place.  [Figure I]  Note that the ends of the upper and lower  pads are offset to reduce the thickness to be sewn.  

# Inspection  

•	 Verify the hardware orientation is correct. •	 Verify the stitch pattern is correct. •	 The leg pad must be reinstalled correctly.

# Background  

The following steps provide an overview of the procedure  to follow:  

# Step One  

The first thing the rigger must do is to inspect the parachute  harness to identify the make and model and determine the  extent of the damage. In some cases, particularly for older  designs, it may not be practical or economically feasible  to repair the harness. If the rigger determines that repair is  practical, he or she must then establish a repair plan for the  project. There are two reasons for this: one, that the project  is done logically and efficiently and two, if not having done  this type of repair before, having contacted the manufacturer  for guidance, the rigger can explain what he or she intends  to do to affect the repair.  

The rigger must make detailed measurements of the harness.  Figure A  shows a typical harness configuration and the  needed dimensions. On a situation where one side of the  harness is intact and can be used for reference, the rigger  still needs dimensions to work against to determine how  much material to order or bill to the job. If both sides of the  harness are damaged, great care must be taken to ensure the  correct measurements of the final repair.  

# Step Two  

Teardown and cleanup is the second most important part of  the process. It is important that all the old thread, glue, and  damaged webbing are removed. Leaving any of these in place  

![](images/16c1e745adaacb5f9d54270091b4c79ac56aa6865d35c43f3559bb94839b34fc.jpg)  

and sewing over them results in a poor appearance. Also, it is  not uncommon to find additional damage or wear at this point  that was not identified during the initial inspection process.  

# Step Three  

After the teardown and cleanup, the replacement webbing can  be measured, cut, and pre-sewn in preparation for installation  to the harness assembly. The construction sequence is  followed. In certain cases, it may be desirable to replace not  just damaged parts but worn ones to give the final result a  more cosmetic appearance. An example is when replacing  a main lift web, it does not look good to reuse the old chest  strap webbing when the main lift web is new material.  

# Step Four  

After the repair is completed, a thorough quality control  program is undertaken. This is especially critical in a  situation where the rigger is working alone and there is no  one to rely on for crosschecking the work. All the critical  points of the repair must be identified and checked as well  as the finished dimensions.  

# Procedure  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Remove all housings, leg pads, and any other parts  that may interfere with the work from the harness.  Disassemble the leg strap/horizontal back strap  junction.  [Figure B]  Disconnect the upper MLW from  the yoke portion of the backpad if necessary. 2.	 Disassemble the junction of the diagonal back strap  and main lift web at the 3-ring attachment point.  [Figure C]  Be very careful not to damage the diagonal  

![](images/18b6aa2c788807a5a3cbea2b6f87812813d327aba4818cfb644ba1740e09b8dc.jpg)  
back strap. If it is damaged, it is a major project to  replace this on most assemblies.  

3.	 Lay out the main lift web assembly and check the  measurements against the initial dimensions. Check  against the opposite side MLW for symmetry.  

4.	 If this side of the harness has a TSO or identification  label attached, carefully remove it for use on the new  assembly. If it is damaged, it may be necessary to get  a new label to replace it. Contact the manufacturer for  guidance. They may require the rigger to return the  old label in exchange for a new one.  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Note that this configuration consists primarily of two  main pieces of webbing. The front MLW is Type-7  webbing and the rear is Type-8.  

2.	 Measure the new webbing for the main lift webs. Add  5 inches for the riser end fold back and allow at least 6  inches extra for shrinkage. While this may sound like  a lot, nothing is more discouraging than to get to the  end of the project and find that the webbing is short  by an inch or two. A couple inches of scrap is a small  price to pay at this point.  

3.	 Starting at one end of the webbing, measure the riser  end configuration. Fold back and glue in place. If there  is a toggle stow loop on the old harness, do not forget  to glue in place before sewing.  [Figure  $D J$   Mark the 4  point W-W pattern and sew with the harness machine  and 5-cord nylon thread.  

![](images/118178bd811dbff46e0680c89358cafa0aeecbbacf58c3a87ff2cbee05e23a17.jpg)  

4.	 Install the steering line guide ring with a duplicate  stitch pattern as per the original.  [Figure E]  In some  instances, the manufacturer may have used a special  bar tack or other stitch pattern to attach the ring. If the  rigger does not have the same machine, it is necessary  to contact the manufacturer for an acceptable  alternative. This should have been identified in  phase one. Check the distance from the end of the  riser to the top of the ring. The industry standard is  4 inches, but there may be special dimensions for  some applications.  

![](images/58b307c1fba6612ffbc95807907c98b2ea77a753804b7a75b99da3058147e4ea.jpg)  

5.	 Install the toggle Velcro ®  keepers as per the original.  [Figure F]  Complete any other sewing needed, such  as the end of the toggle stow loop.  

![](images/4d58017e061f206040f2438326c233d3b2dbdf1d821429e25ccd493bd7b43e77.jpg)  

6.	 If needed, reattach the TSO label at the appropriate  location. If the label is the original one and is made  from material such as Ty-vek ® , try to follow the  original needle holes to avoid perforating the material.  Too many holes cause the label to tear out.  

7.	 Working from the measurement diagram in  Figure A mark the location of the 3-ring.  

8.	 Working downward mark the location of the chest  strap, the ripcord pocket, and the bottom of the upper  leg strap.  [Figure G]  

NOTE:  It is necessary to allow for a certain amount  of shrinkage during the sewing process. There are four  areas of shrinkage to allow for:  

1.	 The harness stitching at the 3-ring. 2.	 The harness stitching at the chest strap. 3.	 The ripcord pocket. 4.	 The harness stitching at the leg strap junction.  

![](images/08720c19dac08afbb64c18bc86bbb2f7b678c5fbeb2525ed21389773b1b1c123.jpg)  

The standard rule of thumb for the sum of these  patterns is approximately .75 inch for the length. In  other words, the marked length of the MLW should be  .75 inch longer than the desired finished length. Most  of the shrinkage is in the ripcord pocket and the leg  strap junction. If the rigger has not done this operation  before, he or she may want to build a sample MLW to  check the measurements and the resultant shrinkage.  

9.	 Sew the Velcro ®  in place for the ripcord pocket.  [Figure H]  

![](images/49471083194d1a84f6ae3bb8073260b41568efbd55999359172937d5fd2305e3.jpg)  

10.	 Glue the chest strap in place. In this instance, do not  forget the housing loop.  

11.	 Using the single needle, pre-sew the front and  rear main lift webs. Use of the sewing pattern in  Figure I  accomplishes this and at the same time creates  the ripcord pocket. Sew the chest strap 3-point W-W  with the harness machine.  [Figure J]

 12.	 Reassemble the upper diagonal back strap and the  

3-ring hardware by threading the rear riser through  the large ring followed by the front riser.  

![](images/0b30068eae240a514cca5c396c42bc6843b06253a42583f37e749322c1d0916b.jpg)  

![](images/eb2523d4ce1b2297f307d0dabbf12ccafb187d2a375523e8872a54b75792a8fd.jpg)  

13.	 Position the 3-ring at the mark on the main lift web  and glue in place. Install the Type-12 confluence wrap  below the 3-ring and mark the 4-point W-W pattern.  [Figure K]

 14.	 Sew the confluence wrap with the harness machine.  [Figure L]

 15.	 Re-create the leg junction. Glue the upper leg strap in  place first and then the horizontal back strap second.  [Figure M]  

![](images/a1e6f8edcb98291684433bc8036d995ceac5aeb98ec2ce0de4c9074ffdc61929.jpg)  

16.	 Mark the 4-point W-W and then sew with the harness  machine. Start the stitch pattern at the front side of the  MLW and complete with the overstitch the full length  of the pattern.  [Figure N]  This provides additional  reinforcing at the upper leg strap/MLW location.  

17.	 Measure the length of the lower leg strap allowing  3.50 inches for the rolled stop end. Trim to length and  then install the stop end with the harness machine.  

![](images/2e904b2f5aba93d5bd98fc00dfc099abd4532e6a660c321889071bfbbfb97ef6.jpg)  

18.	 Reattach the backpad to the upper MLW using the  308 zigzag machine.

 19.	 Reinstall the leg pads using the 308 zigzag machine.

 20.	 Reinstall the ripcord and 3-ring housings and hand  tack in place.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the finished dimensions against the original  dimensions in  Figure A . If only one side has been  replaced, check the new MLW against the opposite  side for comparison. The generally accepted tolerances  for this type of construction are  $\pm\ .25$   inch. In  particular, reserve riser length and the overall MLW  length are the most important. If either of these is  mismatched to their opposites, then the flight of the  canopies may be affected.

 •	 Start inspecting from the riser end working down.  Use the inspection chart in  Figure  $O$   as a guide for the  inspection points. After the inspection, all appropriate  paperwork must be completed. This includes the  rigger’s logbook, the packing data card for the  parachute, and any shop or business forms or log.

# Main Riser Steering Toggle Velcro ®  Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most main risers with a Velcro ®   toggle installation

 •	 Description: Replacement of the Velcro ®  toggle  keeper on main risers

 •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger 

 •	 Materials: E thread, Velcro ®  of the appropriate width  and type

 •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI

 •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, and 6-inch ruler  

# Procedure  

The term “Velcro ® ” is used in a generic fashion for hook and  loop fastener. While the rigger should replace the Velcro ® to match the original configuration. This installation has  proven superior for its holding ability and the secure line  stow configuration.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Mark the location of the old Velcro ® .  [Figure A]  

![](images/e67bb2020d1d5922adc5b4aa1454cbdbd5f12035b39130d20d5a84ed19c7a10a.jpg)  

2.	 Remove the old Velcro ® .  

Reassembly  

1.	 Cut a new piece(s) of Velcro ®  to match the original. 2.	 Position the Velcro ®  to the original location. 3.	 Sew the hook Velcro ®  with a single-needle machine.  Sew an additional row of stitching down the center of  the Velcro ® .  [Figure B]  This keeps the center from  lifting during use and tearing out the edge stitching.  

![](images/56362564e851c9ad736d29d70da9c9caa9b439848af1d8262d1eec37c61796b3.jpg)  

4.	 Position the loop line stow Velcro ®  to match the  hook and sew along the edge, overstitching the ends.  [Figure C]  

![](images/a438882b368fc636cbf4a70d6a7b0edd47870283e46718afae9d0f22db6ae6ad.jpg)  

# Inspection  

•	 Check that the location of Velcro ®  is the same as the  original. •	 Check stitch patterns and center stitching.  

# Section 4, Accessory Components  

Accessory components are comprised of the reserve pilot  chute, reserve deployment bag or device, main deployment  bag, main pilot chute and bridle, main and reserve toggles,  reserve static line (RSL) lanyard, 3-ring release handle, and  reserve ripcord.  

The reserve components generally do not suffer much wear  due to their infrequent use. In addition, with their frequent  inspection during the repack cycle, any necessary repairs  become obvious and are taken care of before they become  major problems.  

1.	 Metal ripcords usually are not repairable and must be  replaced when they are damaged. 2.	 Reserve pilot chutes experience torn mesh, minor  canopy damage, broken hand tackings, and damaged  grommets in the cap.  

The reserve free bag may have the grommets in the closing  flap pull out of the material. The high-drag bridle is a critical  area and is usually not repairable. The RSL lanyard is another  critical item that is usually not repairable, except for the  replacement of a defective snap shackle.  

Main components, on the other hand, are subject to extensive  wear and tear. Most jumpers do not take time to inspect their  main components on a regular basis and generally operate  on a “repair as broken” basis. By the time the rigger sees the  components, it is easier and more cost effective to replace  than to repair them. However, there are regular wear trends  that the rigger can make their customers aware of so they  can look for them and have them taken care of.  

The following are repairs to accessory components, found in  Section 4, Accessory Components, of this chapter:  

•	 Reserve pilot chute repair—mesh, tackings, and  bad grommet •	 Reserve free bag repair—grommet pullout •	 Main pilot chute repair—top canopy reinforcing •	 Main pilot chute collapsible bridle replacement •	 Main deployment bag repair—closing flap grommet  pullout  

# Reserve Pilot Chute Repair—Mesh, Tackings, and  Bad Grommet  

•	 Applicable products: Most reserve pilot chutes •	 Description: Replacement of cap grommet •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: Nylon supertack, stainless steel sheet  grommet—same as original •	 Machines: None •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, hand  tacking needle, grommet set, and diagonal cutters  

# Procedure  

The canopy fabric portion of a reserve pilot chute would  be repaired as necessary with similar patching techniques  as used on a canopy. The mesh portion, however, may be  subject to different techniques. Another area of common  damage is the thru grommet in the top of the pilot chute.  The following procedure describes the replacement of the  grommet in the top of the pilot chute.  Figure A  shows a  damaged grommet.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove the hand tackings used to secure the base of  the pilot chute to the spring.  [Figure B] 2.	 Turn the pilot chute upside down and push the canopy  down until the grommet is exposed.  [Figure C] 3.	 Using diagonal cutters, remove the damaged grommet  being careful not to damage the fabric of the cap.  [Figure D]  

![](images/d7ae1b3132ff534cebde4fe2e87fa857f1dd09d2b76949acb0a94c3e97ac180f.jpg)  
Reassembly  

1.	 Using the handset, set a new grommet. Be careful not  to catch any fabric during the process.  [Figure E]  

2.	 Reposition the canopy over the spring. Grasp the skirt  at the bottom end of the spring. Make sure that the  radial tapes run directly from the bottom to the cap  in a straight line.  [Figure F]  If the tapes “barberpole”  around the spring, the pilot chute may not inflate  properly on launch.  

![](images/b702b2df5e2ab80ebe5ce7cdd90a6894c439abbcd6ae866dcba608f92f5cccbe.jpg)  
3.	 Hand tack the bottom of the canopy to the bottom of  the spring.  [Figure G]  

# Inspection  

•	 Verify the grommet is secure.

 •	 Tapes should be straight.

 •	 Tackings should be secure.  

![](images/4d9d1eff5b9dbddf5384654c3843ea9ef27ca2cd5b280557813a11e982f359b2.jpg)  
Disassembly: Mesh Repair  

1.	 Remove the tackings used to secure the base of the  pilot chute to the spring. 2.	 For small holes, turn the mesh inside out and zigzag  the edges together.  

Reassembly  

1.	 Reattach the bottom of the pilot chute to the spring  with hand tacking.  

# Inspection  

•	 Tapes should be straight. •	 Tackings should be secure.  

# Reserve Free Bag Repair—Grommet Pullout  

•	 Applicable products: Most reserve free bags •	 Description: General repair to the reserve free bag •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread,   $1\%$   inch Type-3 tape, and  grommets to match the original type and size •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, hot knife, grommet set, and  hole punch  

# Procedure  

Most reserve free bag designs are fairly robust. The most  common types of damage seen are the pulling out of the  grommets in the tongue of the bag and tearing out of fabric  from the binding tape due to overstressing during packing.  [Figure   $A J$    Damage to the bridle portion of the free bag is  generally not repairable nor allowed by most manufacturers.  Consequently, any damage in this area would necessitate the  replacement of the bag. The following procedure deals with  the repair of the tongue area and replacement of the grommets.  

![](images/c4781cac7d17a89551d53d955e95351e0822d6c8a8d06ed5c6794712593c1149.jpg)  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove the grommets from the tongue.  [Figure B]  

![](images/da57791357330a2d234b30b7ddc3a7d763d12cb134bdf1703c051b56a641ecaf.jpg)  

2.	 Remove the binding from the tongue area by unpicking  the stitching.  [Figure C]  

![](images/bd87ff56ea6accf018d76801cf52a5c5e802e599e67036d143ec583976fb94ce.jpg)  

Reassembly  

1.	 Cut two pieces of   $1\%$   inch Type-3 tape and overlay  them on each side of the damaged area. Sew around  the edges of the tape and down the center to secure it.  [Figure D]  

![](images/ba6718dd1233905f673de69fd4b887ee4a42290d2d7ae41d537c7947d448bcd6.jpg)  

2.	 Trim the ends of the tape to match the shape of  the tongue.  

3.	 Using the single needle machine, reapply the binding  tape around the edge of the tongue.  [Figure E]  

![](images/a4d6afdbface45590871a78d586c80aebeef6e325b3fab1f8ef39ff51133e37b.jpg)  

4.	 Punch new holes over the exact position as the original  ones.  [Figure F]  

![](images/9b7489bec0bee261353c79e196ac777c63f85114bde6e8348cddb860939453fc.jpg)  
5.	 Insert new grommets.  [Figure G]  

# Inspection  

•	 Reinforcing tape must be secure.

 •	 Binding must be re-sewn.

 •	 Grommets must be set and secure.  

![](images/4be56c37680835b839b7eba21c60ad1b26b1ff7fc89debbd44d46f74f574ef1e.jpg)  

# Main Pilot Chute Repair—Top Canopy  Reinforcing  

•	 Applicable products: Most main hand deploy pilot  chutes •	 Description: Repair of the apex area of a hand deploy  pilot chute •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread and  $\%$   inch Type-3 tape •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, and hot knife  

# Procedure  

Most repairs of the main pilot chute consist of fabric or mesh  repairs and may be repaired similar to canopy procedures.  The most common damage seen on main pilot chutes is in  the area of the apex and the hand deploy handle.  [Figure A] This area is subject to fairly severe stress and strain. The  following procedure deals with the apex area repair. It should  be noted that if the repair is too complex, it is probably more  cost effective to replace rather than repair the pilot chute.  

![](images/ae7d052b5345829ff39094b5e62a9949a3c91632a74401bdc92223218b2f37b0.jpg)  

1.	 Working through the hole in the base, turn the pilot  chute inside out. Unpick the seam at the junction of the  canopy and mesh and between two of the radial tapes.  [Figure B]  This allows good access to the apex area.  

![](images/5b084044d4a53715330f0378d5555940f98043110a35626892d6d732176a8b29.jpg)  

Reassembly  

1.	 Take a piece of   $\%$   inch Type-3 tape and overlay the  reinforcing material at the apex, covering the damaged  area.  [Figure C]  

![](images/fc33f7fcc1890e41a5857295ef1226788864ac0bb1327d92503fb15846805754.jpg)  

2.	 Re-sew the canopy and mesh panels as per the original.  Turn the pilot chute right side out.  

# Inspection  

•	 Damaged area must be covered. •	 Canopy seam must be re-stitched correctly.  

# Main Pilot Chute Collapsible Bridle Replacement  

•	 Applicable products: Most kill-line pilot chute bridle  configurations •	 Description: Replacement of the bridle of a kill-line  collapsible pilot chute  

•	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread, replacement bridle •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI  and 1 inch  $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack 308 zigzag—medium  duty 7–11 SPI (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, green  felt tip marker, 6-inch ruler, hemostats, pony clamp,  and hot glue gun  

# Procedure  

There are three basic main bridle configurations listed below:  

•	 Standard non-collapsible bridle •	 Bungee collapsible bridle •	 Centerline or “kill-line” collapsible bridle  

The standard bridle is a simple design and any damage usually  results in the replacement of the bridle. The exception to this  is if the tape attaching the curved pin is worn. The replacement  of the tape is a simple task. The most common bridle in use  today is the kill-line collapsible type. The replacement of the  bridle is described in the following procedure.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove the old bridle from the pilot chute.  [Figure A]  

![](images/6a5875b99c54a987ab7e5cadc7ff1fb2c6eff2d6c9dc00cc0c711f1ce33d945a.jpg)  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Thread the loop ends of the bridle through the bottom  support tapes of the pilot chute.  [Figure B] 2.	 Glue the ends in place with the glue gun.  [Figure C] 3.	 Bar tack the bridle along the sides. Do not capture the  centerline.  [Figure D] 4.	 Align the bridle tapes on the center of the pilot chute  attachment tapes and bar tack in place.  [Figure E]  

![](images/600350d849adcda047ad5c631ecdee87da9adb8e5c28255e161eda48c7af24ac.jpg)  

5.	 Check the trim of the pilot chute centerline. When the  centerline is taut, the apex should be even with or no  more than 1 inch below the skirt of the canopy.

 6.	 Anchor the bag end of the pilot chute at the bag stop.  Grasp the Spectra ®  centerline and pull to “cock”  the bridle.

 7.	 Route the free end of the Spectra ®  centerline up  through the center of the pilot chute and through the  loop of the pilot chute centerline at the apex. Grasp the  handle of the pilot chute and apply tension so that the  centerline of the pilot chute and the bridle are equal.  Pinch the Spectra ®  line so that the location will not  move. Secure with 2 half hitches.  [Figure F]  

![](images/33e87b9bf34297034e79aad940d304fa1c826097d62e4565735b93a156febfba.jpg)  

8.	 Change the anchor point to the end of the bridle.  Stretch the bridle so that the pilot chute is collapsed.  Lay the pilot chute out with the mesh exposed and  secure the radial tapes with the pony clamp at the  mesh/fabric seam.  [Figure G]  Pull moderate tension  on the pony clamp and check the location of the apex  of the pilot chute at the opening of the bridle.  

![](images/f903a2f529ccab543be8d6416de82a000ad0f425ad4ee635e3935d776b03e4b8.jpg)  

9.	 Again anchor the bridle at the bag stop and cock  the bridle. Check the position of the apex of the  pilot chute. It should be within 1 inch of the skirt.  [Figure H]  

![](images/1a06d6f6593247ed92921668b86c52ce5b13e95a78cffe227236e7326329fa67.jpg)  

10.	 Finger-trap the running end of the Spectra ®  centerline  for a distance of 3 inches.  [Figure I]  Bar tack or zigzag  to secure. Trim the excess line.  

![](images/2c4246d5a182d5d152df43ee809ee7112aca7a09645bc4ff916be42d835737e0.jpg)  

11.	 Cock the bridle. Take the hemostats and grasp the  Spectra ®  centerline at the eye of the bridle.  [Figure J]  

12.	 Pull the centerline out to expose approximately 3  inches each side of the hemostats. Take the green felt  tip marker and place a mark at the hemostat location  and 1 inch either side.  [Figure K]  Color the line  between the marks and on both sides.  [Figure L]  

13.	 Pull the bridle tight to reposition the centerline and  check the green color of the eye.  [Figure M]  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the bar tack at the pilot chute loops and at  the base.  

![](images/f70f129251cf164b65857fc512eaebf122e939bf39d077a0df4153feec9a7849.jpg)  

•	 Verify the Spectra ®  centerline is knotted, finger- trapped and sewn. •	 Verify the colored eye location of the centerline is  marked green.  

# Main Deployment Bag Repair—Closing Flap  Grommet Pullout  

•	 Applicable products: All main deployment bags •	 Description: Repair of main deployment bag •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread, Type-4 tape or equivalent and  grommets to match original •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 6-inch ruler, grommet set, and hole punch  

# Procedure  

The most common repair needed to a main deployment is the  repair of the closing flap in the area of the grommets. The  grommets work loose and pull out, damaging the material.  The tongue will need reinforcing and new grommets.  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove grommets from the tongue of the bag. 2.	 Unpick the binding along the edge of the grommet  reinforcing tape.  [Figure A]  

![](images/89b9810b14623db455889f43b0d328d1b3f426be673c204ce9bfffa434566dd7.jpg)  
Reassembly  

1.	 Overlay a piece of 1.5 inch Type-4 tape on the top of  the bag tongue and sew down.  [Figure B] 2.	 Punch new holes through the Type-4 from the back  side in the same location as the original location. 3.	 Overlay the back side of the tongue with a piece of 1.5  inch Type-3 tape and sew down.

•	 Verify stitching is secure. •	 Verify new grommets are secure.  

# Section 5, Alterations  

In the “old days” when military surplus equipment was  common, there were a number of alterations available to  make the surplus equipment suitable for sport use. Since then,  however, the sport has progressed and purpose-built sport  equipment is now the rule, so most equipment does not need  any specialized alterations for use. Most alterations now deal  primarily with harness size adjustments for individuals, or they  are designed to enhance the performance of the parachute.  

In the past, alterations were often done by well-intentioned  individuals who knew how to do them but in most cases  did not have the authority to perform them. The common  attitude was, “I’m a master rigger; I can do anything.” As  long as the work was done reasonably well and no one got  hurt, this was an accepted practice. While there may be a few  individuals who still adhere to that philosophy, as a whole,  the rigging profession is much more aware of limitations  in regard to alterations. Under 14 CFR part 65, section  65.129(d), “No certificated parachute rigger may – (d) Alter  a parachute in a manner that is not specifically authorized  by the Administrator or the manufacturer.” In today’s world,  manufacturers are much more concerned with the alterations  being performed on their products. With the advent of the  Internet and other means of high-speed communications,  riggers have much more access to the manufacturer and are  more likely to communicate with them as to what can be  done. Also, due to liability issues, many riggers are reluctant  to undertake alterations without the manufacturer’s approval.  

What constitutes the manufacturer’s approval for an  alteration? To be safe, the rigger should always have  something in writing that specifically addresses the alteration  the rigger wishes to perform. There should be a two way line  of communication for this. One, the rigger should specifically  request from the manufacturer the authority to perform the  alteration. This should include serial number, make, model  of the product involved, and a description of the alteration.  Two, in return, the rigger should receive written authorization  to perform the alteration. The manufacturer specifies the  form of this authorization, but it should have the date, the  rigger’s name and certificate number, and a reference to the  rigger’s original request. This fulfills the requirements of the  regulations and protects both parties involved.  

In certain cases, a rigger might want to perform an alteration  on a product for which the manufacturer is no longer in  business. This is commonly known as an orphaned product.  

If this occurs, the rigger should obtain approval from  the FAA. Refer to AC 105-2, Sport Parachute Jumping.  Alterations to approved parachutes must be performed only  by a certificated and appropriately rated Master Parachute  Rigger , a parachute manufacturer, or any other manufacturer  that the FAA considers competent. To receive approval from  the FAA, a person qualified to alter a parachute would first  contact the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) to  discuss the proposed alteration with an FAA inspector. The  inspector requires a description of the proposed alteration  along with a sample, technical data and proposed test data  to ensure that the altered parachute meets all applicable  requirements. After discussing the proposed alteration, the  two parties agree on a suitable plan of action. The individual  then drafts an application, in letter form, addressed to the  local FSDO. Along with the letter, the following information  needs to be attached:  

1.	 A clear description of the alteration 2.	 Technical information that includes drawings and  photographs, materials used, stitch patterns, and  location of altered components 3.	 A means of identifying the altered parachute, such  as model and serial number, and identification of the  person having performed the alteration  

After the inspector reviews the application, if he or she is  satisfied, he or she indicates approval by date stamping,  signing, and placing the FSDO identification stamp on the  letter of application. Upon receiving this approval, the master  rigger can then perform the alteration.  

The following are alterations found in Section 5, Alterations,  of this chapter:  

•	 \* Articulated harness main lift web resizing •	 Leg pad resizing •	 \* Automatic Activation Device (AAD) installation  

NOTE:  A \* denotes approval needed by the Administrator  or the manufacturer.  

# Articulated Harness Main Lift Web (MLW)  Resizing  

•	 Applicable products: Most articulated harness  configurations •	 Description: Resizing of an articulated harness •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread, 5-cord nylon thread, Type-7  webbing, or as original and Type-4 1 inch tape  

•	 Machines: 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI,  heavy-duty harness machine, Singer 7–33 or  equivalent 4-6 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 18-inch ruler, and hot glue gun  

# Procedure  

Resizing of a harness is usually considered an alteration.  However, because of the simplicity of the procedure, most  manufacturers do not object to a qualified master rigger  performing the procedure. It would be wise, however, for  the rigger to contact the manufacturer for permission before  undertaking the procedure. The following procedure is shown  on a Voodoo TM  system.  

# Disassembly  

1.	 Measure the MLW to check if the harness is even. 2.	 Remove the ripcord pocket/MLW cover.  [Figure A]  

![](images/e132b797490412c874ce4e4bc1bd58010850f323e7030b53dabc709c99fbc829.jpg)  

# 3.	 Measure the lower MLW.  [Figure B]  

![](images/9a21acdbc353310eeaaf60c9c1fea00d0f1110140f3e5bae1d965e40a2bc0855.jpg)  

4.	 Remove the lower MLW.  [Figure C]  

![](images/201ed8b84641b039efb296213b60435ad70e66e967909a67b85d384bceb3be34.jpg)  

Reassembly  

1.	 Measure the webbing for the lower main lift web.  [Figure D] 2.	 Zigzag the bowtie folds as marked including the Type- 4 buffers.  [Figure E] 3.	 Glue the MLW in place. Make sure that the open end  of the webbing is on the rear and oriented up towards  the chest strap. 4.	 Mark the stitch pattern on the MLW and sew with the  harness machine. Use a 3 inch W-W pattern at the top  as shown in  Figure   $F$  . Include a box pattern on the  lower section of the MLW. 5.	 Reattach the ripcord pocket/MLW cover.  [Figure G]  

# Inspection

# Automatic Activation Device (AAD) Installation  

•	 Applicable products: Most 1-pin sport piggyback  systems •	 Description: Installation of a CYPRES ®  AAD to a  1-pin sport piggyback harness and container system •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Master Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread—color to match, CYPRES ®   installation kit, and Spandex ®  fabric (optional) •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11 SPI  and 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 12-inch ruler, hot knife, and wallpaper roller  

# Procedure  

The following procedure is representative of a typical  installation of the   $\mathbf{C Y P R E S^{\mathfrak{G}}}$   AAD into a modern 1-pin  reserve container system. While providing guidance for this  operation, it is imperative that the rigger possesses the proper  instructions from both the harness-container manufacturer  and the AAD manufacturer.  

# Disassembly  

Open the right side corner of the reserve container.  [Figure A]  While this might not be needed on some size  containers, it generally makes the installation of the pocket  easier and it is not that hard to close the corner back up.  

![](images/c4498451618aaddfcf9bd5d7e1cae4ee5d33dbca829927ebe4ccd166615b06b9.jpg)  

# Reassembly  

1.	 Mark the center of the container wall at the bottom.  [Figure B]  

![](images/d6f3eca26a20ade2861cf50171a6a53619bc880a05e924e75b188fc1423489d9.jpg)  

2.	 Mark the center of the Spandex ®  portion of the  CYPRES ®  pocket.  [Figure  $C J$   Do not mark the center  of the entire pocket. The Spandex ®  must be centered  on the wall to allow for the correct positioning of the  CYPRES ®  processing unit.  

![](images/054fcecd173761dcfe9b89b6316f712d526908f8d903ed74443a7363c3c99aeb.jpg)  
3.	 Align the marks and the pocket as close to the bottom  of the wall as possible.  [Figure D]  

![](images/b5af8daa34333177254ea868ed188258f309296432c16039018351a8cd5db6fb.jpg)  

4.	 Sew around the pocket with the single needle  machine. Backstitch .5 inch at each of the corners  for reinforcing.  

5.	 Next, install or create a cable channel for the control  cable. Some systems, such as the one shown in  Figure   $F$  , can be modified to provide the channel.  Others need to use the adhesive backed channel  provided with the CYPRES ®  kit.  

# Built-In Channel Modification Configuration  

1.	 Mark the bottom and top of the pack tray cover as  shown.  [Figure E]  Place a hand tack at the A position.  Unpick the stitching between the corner bar tack and  the hand tack at the A position. Also, unpick the  stitching between the B bar tacks.  

![](images/122050a2b2f52c1efeac21237dc22f25edcbb61a71b805feca09a8c6521bc7f9.jpg)  

2.	 There is now a built-in channel to slide the control  cable thru and stow the excess cable as well.  [Figure F]  

![](images/9c636d5eeae0e896d6748c8a6aa59c735ba697325689b7a718d5f995e7d09b94.jpg)  

# Adhesive Channel Installation  

1.	 Measure the distance along the long axis of the reserve  container from the bottom of the pocket location to  the top of the container near the planned location for  the control unit.  [Figure G]  

![](images/0795d54226bbfb8222efcbade8e6f776ddb9c813209b3b1ab7d30b8511a9a050.jpg)  

2.	 Cut a piece of the adhesive backed channel to the same  length. Remove the adhesive covering and position the  channel in place. Roll the channel with the wallpaper  roller to secure the adhesive.

 3.	 Locate the position for the control pocket. Unpick the  stitching that holds the main container to the backpad.  [Figure H]  

![](images/23cadb653ee3ba0546bcc5ee4b2365447fcf753cda3b7f7d415f2d407471a012.jpg)  

4.	 Insert the pocket with the mouth towards the channel  opening and restitch the container to the backpad.  [Figure I]  Make sure the control head fits into  the pocket.  

![](images/3aa5f49fd111bb1e5c8f9b4509b364c9dbee70e0163bc9f7e08e5f2ce6070216.jpg)  

# Cutter Channel and Elastic Installation  

The location of the cutter is specified by the container  manufacturer’s instructions and should be strictly adhered  to. The following location is specified for the Talon system.  

1.	 Lay the CYPRES ®  unit on the pocket and route the  cutter/cable assembly out the top of the pocket and  in as direct a line to the side flap as possible. It is  necessary to cut a hole in the bottom launching flap  to access the side flap.  

2.	 Where the cable passes through the bottom launching  flap as close to the wall as possible, place a line  approximately .5 inch long.  [Figure J]  Take the hot  knife and cut a single slit the length of the mark. DO  NOT CUT ANY OTHER MATERIAL.  

![](images/20ffa1668538a3ad4ccae9415555f6c5eea2056d5445df5ae885e7ecc9124fb8.jpg)  

3.	 Route the cable through the slit and then along the  side flap as shown.  [Figure K]  

4.	 Place marks along the binding showing the start and  finish locations for the cable channel. Again, the rigger  can use the adhesive backed channel or make a channel  out of the Spandex ®  material as shown.  [Figure L]  

![](images/812bf1da2cfbe2221219aa452920e9686bcd122279bf9a113a69006326a9c22e.jpg)

5.	 Route the cutter thru the channel and out the end  nearest the side flap grommet.  

6.	 Slide the cutter elastic over the cutter and position the  cutter over the grommet with the hole to the outside of  the grommet and the elastic facing inwards on the flap.  Mark the corners of the cutter as shown.  [Figure M]  

![](images/8c8f62ae289cec17943ee7ed2d70bdc814dd842d468c731f0ab37a903bd49d7d.jpg)  

7.	 Remove the CYPRES ®  from the container completely.  Position the elastic sleeve to the marks and sew in  place with the zigzag machine.  [Figure N]  

![](images/5a9e8cfbff4d5e8000eb490d6d24fd721257c8526d3ab6e29cb9a727ec3407a6.jpg)  

8.	 Re-close the corner of the reserve container as per  the original.  

# Inspection  

•	 Verify the CYPRES ®  pocket is sewn with the  Spandex ®  pocket centered on the wall. •	 Control cable channel must be installed. •	 Control unit pocket must be installed. •	 Cutter cable channel must be installed. •	 Cutter elastic must be installed. •	 Verify the reserve container corner is closed,  as necessary. •	 Check the fit of CYPRES ®  in the entire installation. •	 Log installation data on the packing data card.  Remember, this is an alteration.  

# Section 6, Manufacturing  

There might come times when it is more practical for the  rigger to manufacture replacement parts in order to return a  system to operation. The items listed in this section are those  that are either main component parts or the reserve closing  loop, which is simple to make and usually within the purview  of the senior rigger to do so. It is important for the rigger to  recognize just what parts are legal to make. One item some  riggers make, but one in which they are not usually approved  to do so, is the Safety Stow™ for the reserve free bag. As  part of the TSO-C23d component, it is manufactured from  approved materials and under an approved Quality Control  system. As simple as this item is, if it is not manufactured  according to the original configuration. There is a very good  chance for a failure of the reserve deployment system. The  best rule of thumb to follow is this: If the component is part  of the approved assembly, then it is probably not something  that may be manufactured in the field. The common exception  to this rule is the reserve closing loop.  

The rigger who is undertaking the manufacture of these  components needs to have, at the minimum, the following  sewing machines: medium duty, single-needle, double needle  machine with a binding attachment and a zigzag machine. In  addition, the rigger needs grommet setting tools and a basic  selection of webbings, materials, and fabrics.  

The following are outlines of construction procedures for  the manufacture of the listed items found in Section 6,  Manufacturing:  

•	 Main and reserve closing loop manufacture •	 Main deployment bag •	 Bottom of Container (BOC) pocket  

# Main and Reserve Closing Loop Manufacture  

•	 Applicable products: All harness and containers that  utilize a fabric closing loop configuration •	 Description: Fabrication of fabric closing loops •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: E thread, loop material—725# Spectra ® •	 Machines: 301 straight stitch—medium duty 7–11  SPI, 308 zigzag—medium duty 7–11 SPI, and 1 inch   $\times\,42$   stitch bar tack (optional) •	 Equipment: Scissors, seam ripper or scalpel, marking  pencil, 18-inch ruler, hot knife, finger-trapping needle  or fid, and finger-trapping wire  

# Procedure  

The terms “locking loops” and “closing loops” are  synonymous and used interchangeably. Fabric locking  loops have become the preferred method of closing most  modern parachute containers. Dating from the mid 1970s,  the most common material was Type-III suspension line. It  was soon recognized that other materials, such as Dacron ® were superior for this use. Today, Spectra ®  is widely used for  reserve locking loops while Dacron ®  has remained preferred  for main loops due to its durability. The following technique  demonstrates the fabrication of a 1-pin and a 2-pin loop.  

Preparation: 1-Pin Loop  

1.	 Measure the length of the original loop. If the stop  knot is too tight to untie, allow extra length (you can  always cut it down, but you cannot glue it back on).  

2.	 Cut an appropriate length of material and hot knife  one end on an angle.  

# Fabrication  

1.	 Fold the line in half and mark the center.  [Figure A]  

![](images/40b5cce607ed5b1c785039c8ca03d8b343c102ef1808336390fd45c1172dac50.jpg)  

2.	 Place a mark at 1 inch from the center on the hot  knifed end.

 3.	 Take the finger-trapping fid and screw it onto the hot  knifed end.  [Figure B]  

![](images/7bec729772bd9c132ddfe883984b815edfd540a963ae2d94fbae3dfb0efb9516.jpg)  

4.	 Insert the pointed end of the fid into the line at the  farthest mark by separating the weave of the material  so that the fid then passes through the length of the  braided line and out the scissor cut end.  [Figure C]

 5.	 Draw the line through until the two marks are aligned.  This results in a loop eye of approximately .5 inch.  [Figure D]

 6.	 Pinch the eye of the loop with one hand and smooth  the material from the eye to the end. Hot knife the  running end.  

![](images/d92587c646ca10e686a48e5e00c5a61b86992a83b5e7d98e0ed6bdde29c534da.jpg)  

7.	 For short loops used with a main container, simply tie  an overhand knot in the loop for the required length.  A metal washer is used to keep the loop from pulling  through the grommet.  [Figure E]  

![](images/c1b95a4beffc7cfd673cc9c27fbfb1d08426b60fbf0327699fc750cef3a59e58.jpg)  

8.	 If the loop is to be used with a reserve container, it  may be required to sew the finger-trapped part of the  loop for security. If this is the case, simply sew the  length of the finger-trapped portion of the loop with  a single-needle machine before hot knifing the end.  Start at the running end and sew towards the eye of the  loop. Stop sewing approximately .12 inch from the eye  and then backstitch a minimum of 1 inch.  [Figure F] Trim the end with the hot knife.  

Fabrication: 2-Pin Loop  

1.	 Measure and mark the line according to  Figure G . Cut  both ends with the scissors. 2.	 Using the finger-trapping wire, finger-trap one end  to form the loop and have the running end exit  approximately 1 inch past the center mark.  [Figure H] 3.	 Repeat with the opposite end. Exit again past the center  so that the two lines overlap at the center.  [Figure I] 4.	 Pull the loop tight to remove any slack. 5.	 Bar tack or zigzag the loop ends.  [Figure J] 6.	 Trim the running ends.  [Figure K] 7.	 Bar tack or zigzag the center overlap junction.  [Figure L] 8.	 Measure the finished loop.  

# Inspection  

•	 Check the loop length. •	 Verify stitching is secure and backstitched.

# Section 7, Manufacturing  

The following are miscellaneous procedures used in repairs  and alterations found in Section 7, Manufacturing, of this  chapter:  

•	 Hand tacking techniques •	 Cleaning and washing procedures  

# Hand Tacking Techniques  

•	 Applicable products: Any systems requiring hand  tacking •	 Description: Securing housings, hardware, etc., with  hand tackings •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: Nylon supertack tacking thread •	 Machines: None  

•	 Equipment: Scissors, assorted hand tacking needles,  and modified navy end tab  

# Procedure  

Hand tacking is an integral part of rigging skills. There are  numerous places where components or parts are joined.  Hardware, housings, cones, and other parts require hand  tacking to secure them to their positions. The following  figures show typical tacking techniques.  

# Pilot Chute  

1.	 Take the needle and supertack and pass it through the  reinforcing tape at the bottom of the pilot chute mesh  capturing the spring coil.  [Figure A]  

![](images/744c18e9cc16e83ab33567addee89b35fc17c8527f9d237a4b783c6e7e18a8c5.jpg)  

2.	 Cross over the radial seam reinforcing tape and again  pass the needle through the reinforcing tape and  capturing the spring coil as before.  [Figure B]  

![](images/39601201abdf57ce538b1ba9e23a9a7f84a720992c01406cc7df8d58a73b7de7.jpg)  
3.	 Secure the ends of the supertack with a surgeon’s knot  and locking knot.  [Figure   $C J$   Trim to a  $\%$   inch tail.  

![](images/bfbcd7dcab1bfe8894046fbf1376fad2bab1b768effe88a03f7f25d118a6694f.jpg)  

# Housing  

1.	 Position the housing end flush with the end of the  housing channel.

 2.	 Take the needle and supertack and tie an overhand  knot approximately 1 inch from the end.

 3.	 Pass the needle through the inside of the housing  channel and then around the outside below the housing  end.  [Figure D]  The purpose is to choke the end of  the channel so that the housing does not protrude from  the end.

# Cleaning and Washing Procedures  

•	 Applicable products: Most harness and container  systems •	 Description: Cleaning and washing parachute  components •	 Authorized repairmen: FAA Senior or Master  Parachute Rigger  •	 Materials: Woolite ®  or similar mild liquid soap and a  lot of clean fresh water •	 Machines: Jumbo tumbler type commercial washing  machine. It is not recommended to do this in your  home washing machine. •	 Equipment: Medium stiffness scrub brush, large  pillowcase or laundry bag, wash tub, assortment of  rags, and extra laundry  

# Background  

This procedure applies only to harness and container systems.  Most canopy manufacturers do not approve of washing their  products to clean them. Doing so may alter the performance  characteristics of the canopy. Follow the instructions in the  owner’s manual for each make and model of canopy.  

# Colorfastness  

It is important to check for colorfastness of certain types of  materials. Colored E thread and Type-3 binding tape have  shown a tendency for their colors to run when wet or damp.  Red is particularly prone to doing so. Before using the  following procedures, the rigger or owner should check for  colorfastness. Do so by wetting a small area of the container  including the binding tape and then lay a damp piece of white  cotton t-shirt on the wet area. Leave for 30 minutes. Check  to see if any color has transferred to the cotton fabric. If not,  then it is probably alright to wash the rig. Remember, this  procedure in no way guarantees that the colors will not run.  

# Procedure  

Disassembly  

1.	 Remove all canopies, AADs, and component parts,  such as toggles, RSL, ripcords, bags, and elastic  keepers, as well as the packing data card.  

# Handwashing  

1.	 Soak the rig in lukewarm water. Apply straight  Woolite ®  or soap onto the dirtiest areas and scrub with  the brush. Soak in lukewarm water for 20 minutes. 2.	 Scrub the rig vigorously all over. Soak for another  20 minutes. 3.	 Continue scrubbing vigorously and soak for another  20 minutes. For particularly dirty rigs, empty the first  batch of soapy water and wash in a fresh batch of  soapy water. 4.	 Squeeze out as much soapy water as possible. Immerse  in fresh, clean, cool water and rinse several times until  no further soap comes out. 5.	 Hang to dry out of direct sunlight. The use of a  fan directly onto the rig will greatly speed up the  drying process.  

# Machine Washing  

1.	 Wrap the hardware of the rig with the rags to pad them  so they do not beat the inside of the machine. 2.	 Soak the rig in lukewarm water and apply Woolite ®   or other soap directly onto the dirtiest parts. Scrub  these parts vigorously. Allow these parts to absorb the  Woolite ®  during the time traveling to the Laundromat. 3.	 Place the rig into the pillowcase or laundry bag and  add extra padding, such as extra laundry. Levi’  $\mathbf{S}^{(\mathbb{B})}$    work exceptionally well for this. Tie off the pillowcase  or bag to hold everything in. Place in the washing  machine adding more washing soap and Woolite ®   and wash in warm water. 4.	 Run through at least two rinse cycles or hand rinse  several times until no soap comes out. 5.	 Hang to dry out of direct sunlight. The use of a fan  onto the rig will greatly speed up the drying process.  

# Scotchgard ®  

The use of Scotchgard ®  brand fabric protector has become  commonplace in recent years. This fabric treatment seals the  pores of the fabric against dirt and other stains. Scotchgard ®  is not a magical “silver bullet” against dirt. However, it has  shown good results in keeping lighter-colored fabric cleaner  longer under normal use. Grinding in on grass or asphalt  or other heavy abuse still stains and/or damages the rig  materials. Scotchgard ®  is not harmful to today’s container  fabrics, such as para-pak and Cordura ® . There are currently  several Scotchgard ®  formulas. The standard fabric and  upholstery formula is in the red can.  [Figure A]  Do not use  the rug and carpet formula in the blue can. After the rig is  completely dry, hang it in a well ventilated location.  

![](images/57b4661624e8fe0e72b95dcd845d769e6e6736f82e3c0ae125cdafb7f89a1e00.jpg)  

Following the directions on the can, apply the protector to  the entire outer surface of the rig. For those areas, such as  the inside of the leg pads, backpad, and bottom of the main  container, and light colored panels, such as white, etc., apply  a second coat after the first has dried. Do not intentionally  spray the hardware, housings, and clear vinyl CYPRES ®  window. After the rig has dried, it may then be reassembled  and placed back into service.  

# Chapter Summary  

It is very important that any repairs or maintenance of the  parachute and its related systems are done correctly so that the  parachute is always airworthy. This chapter provides detailed  step-by-step procedures for many repairs and alterations that  can be done by both senior and master riggers. All riggers  must learn to identify conditions that may be unsafe and learn  how to undertake the necessary repairs to return the parachute  to its original, airworthy configuration.

# Standardized Nomenclature for Ram-Air Parachutes  

# Introduction  

This Technical Standard was adopted by the Parachute Industry Association (PIA) on March 27, 2015 . Input concerning revisions and additions should be submitted to:  

Parachute Industry Association, Inc.  Attention:  Technical Committee Chair  3833 West Oakton Street  Skokie, IL 60076  Telephone: 847-674-9472  Fax: 847-674-9743  Email:   TechComChair@pia.com  

# Definitions  

Airlock:   On a canopy, a valve which permits air flow more easily in one direction, and restricts airflow in  the opposite direction.  In most case, airlocks are installed in the nose of the canopy to permit air to enter  during deployment and flight, and restrict air from flowing out the nose to ensure better pressurization in  turbulent air.  

# Angle of  

Attack:   The angle formed between the flight path and the chord line.  The Greek letter alpha ( α )  is used to denote the angle of attack.  See Figure 3.  

Trim:   The angle formed between the horizontal reference line and the trim line.  The Greek letter  theta ( θ ) is used to denote the angle of trim. Used instead of the somewhat analogous aircraft  term “angle of incidence.”  See Figure 1b.  

# Area,  

Airfoil Section:   The finished cross sectional area of a given rib (airfoil) section.  When ribs are  not identical, the specific rib must be identified. Used for calculations of pack volume and internal  volume of canopy.  

Planform:   The   product of the average chord times the average span of the canopy.  

Projected:   The area of an   inflated canopy as viewed from above, perpendicular to the chord line  at the centerline of the parachute. Due to canopy curvature and cell inflation bulging the projected  area is always smaller than the planform area.  

2 Aspect Ratio:  Span /Area, which for a rectangular planform reduces to Span/Chord.  

Attachment Point:   A loop of tape, webbing, or the functional equivalent, for attaching something to the  surface of the canopy.  

Pilot Chute .   An attachment point for the pilot chute or pilot chute bridle, including any  reinforcement to reduce the effects of abrasion, and also including any additional rib- or canopy- reinforcing tapes intended to distribute the load from the pilot chute to the canopy.  

Suspension Line.    An attachment point for a suspension line or control line.   Some canopies use  extensions of rib-reinforcing or flare-reinforcing load tapes to form line attachment points.  See  also  Flare, Suspension Line Attachment .  

Cell:   The chamber formed by upper and lower surfaces and two adjacent loadbearing ribs.  

# Channel,  

Drawstring:   A fabric or tape channel that encloses a drawstring, most often found on main  canopy sliders.  

Pilot Chute Reefing:   A channel that runs through the center of the canopy, from upper surface  to the lower surface, to allow the pilot chute bridle to connect to the slider.  

Chord:  The distance from the farthest forward point to the farthest aft point on an airfoil section.  If the  canopy airfoil sections are not identical, an average chord may be specified.  Airfoil dimensions are  assumed to be finished dimensions unless otherwise specified.  See also  Span , and  Line (Design),  Chord.  

# Construction,  

Chordwise:  A construction method in which   upper and lower surfaces are assembled from  panels which run from front to rear (chordwise) and are joined to the ribs and each other using a  variety of sewn seams. The   most common type of ram-air parachute construction.  

Spanwise:   A construction method in which the upper and lower surfaces are assembled from  panels that run from side to side (spanwise) across the full width of the canopy.  Personnel  parachutes usually require three or four panels each for the upper and lower surfaces.  

Crossports:   Holes cut in the rib sections to balance the air pressure between adjacent chambers.  

Drawstring, Slider:   A length of tape or line which may be pulled to collapse or remove a slider after  deployment.  

Flare, Suspension Line Attachment:  An extension of a load bearing rib used on some canopies to  distribute suspension line loads along the lower rib seams.  A suspension line attachment flare may be  integral with the rib or may be sewn to it.  

# Line (Design),  

Chord:  A line drawn through the farthest forward point and the farthest aft point on an airfoil  section.  See Figure 3.  

Reference, Horizontal:   A line drawn at a right angle to the Vertical Reference Line.  Usage is  equivalent to the practice of using the aircraft longitudinal axis   as an aircraft reference line.  See  Figure 3.  

Reference, Vertical:   A line drawn through the links and the quarter chord point.  

Trim:  A   line drawn through the farthest forward and farthest aft line attachment points (excluding control line attachment points).  See Figure 1b.  

# Line (Rigging),  

Cascade:   A line attached with one end at the canopy and the other end to an intermediate point  of an adjacent line.  Contrast with  Continuous.  

Continuous:   A line attached with one end at the canopy and the other end at the riser of  connector link.  Contrast with  Cascade .  

Control:    A   line fastened to the trailing edge of the canopy, used to steer and modulate the  forward speed and descent rate of the parachute.  Also known as steering or brake line.  

Flare:   A control line intended primarily for flaring the canopy for landing, but which may  also for steering.  Also known as  Secondary  control lines, in which case the remaining  control lines are known as  Primary  control lines.  

Brake-Toggle:   When a control line is constructed in sections, that portion of the line  between the toggle and the deployment set eye (“cat-eye”).  

Lower:   When a control line is constructed in sections, that portion of the line between  the deployment set eye and the upper portion.  

Upper:   When a control line is constructed in sections, that portion of the line between  the canopy and where it converges with other lines attached to the canopy.  

# Identification System for:  

Suspension lines:   lettered “A,” “B,” “C,” . . . from front to rear along each load-bearing  seam.  Numbered from outboard to inboard (outboard lines numbered “1”; see Figure 2a )  or inboard to outboard (lines on center load-bearing seams numbered “1”; see Figure 2b).  

Control lines:   numbered by rib seam, including non-load-bearing ribs, from outboard to  inboard.  See Figures 2a and 2b.  

Suspension:  One of the lines that carries the load from the canopy surface to the risers.  Control  lines are usually not considered suspension lines.  

Pilot Chute Controlled Reefing (PCR):  A   parachute reefing system that use s  the drag of the pilot chute  to modulate the opening rate of the canopy.  

Planform:  The overall shape of the wing as viewed from above, perpendicular to the chord line.  

Quarter Chord Point:   a point on the  chord line one quarter of the distance from the nose to the tail of  an airfoil.  

Removable Deployment System (RDS):   A slider variation that permits the slider to be removed and  stowed separately after deployment.  “Full RDS” is a further variation that also permits the pilot chute,  bridle, and deployment bag to be removed and stowed after deployment.  

Rib:  A   section of fabric installed between the upper and lower surfaces of a canopy. Used to establish the  airfoil shaped of the canopy.  Rib numbering systems (for example, from outboard to inboard, or from  inboard to outboard) vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  

Rib, crossbrace:   A rib or partial rib installed at an angle other than a  $90^{\circ}$   angle to the upper and  lower surfaces of a canopy.  

Rib, loadbearing:   A rib to which suspension lines are attached, installed at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle to the  upper and lower surfaces of a canopy.  

Rib, non-loadbearing:   A rib without attached suspension lines, installed at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle to the  upper and lower surfaces of a canopy.  

Rib, stabilizer:  A stabilizer-end rib assembly with line attachments along the lower edge.  

# Rigging,  

Crown:   A suspension line length pattern in which all “A” lines are the same length across the  span of the canopy, all “B” lines are the same length across the span of the canopy, and similarly  all  $"{\mathbb C}"$   and “D” lines, etc.  

Flat:   A suspension line length pattern in which the lines in the center of the canopy are shorter  than the lines farther outboard.   In flight, the center part of the airfoil is flatter and creates more  vertical lift than a crown-rigged canopy, which generates lift along the radius of the spanwise arc.  

# Setting,  

Deployment:   The position of the trailing edge when the control lines are pulled down to their  deployment position.  

Full-Flight:   The position of the trailing edge when  the control lines are fully extended.  

Slider:  A parachute   reefing device usually consisting of a rectangular section of canopy cloth reinforced  on the edges with lightweight webbing or tape, and with a large grommet or D-ring installed at each  corner. Sliders may have fabric removed from the rectangular section or may have fabric edge extensions  installed to change opening characteristics.  Slider variations include:  

•   Domed, with a planform similar to a flat rectangular slider, but with fabric pleated along the edges.   •   Split,  capable of being disassembled into halves after deployment .  •   Spider, made of two lengths of webbing sewn in an “X,” and usually used with pilot chute  controlled reefing.  See  Pilot Chute Controlled Reefing (PCR).   •   Removable. See  Removable Deployment System .  

Slider Bumper:   A small device, typically made from vinyl/silicon tubing, Type-4 tape, or Type-12  webbing, installed at the lower end of the suspension lines to prevent damage to the slider grommets  caused by the slider contacting the connector links.  

Slider Stop:  A small   piece of rigid material (metal, plastic, phenolic, etc.) normally covered in tape or light  webbing, installed on the lower edge of a   stabilizer panels to prevent a slider   grommet from riding up over  the stabilizer material and damaging the stabilizers or the slider.  

Slider Stop Chafing Pad:   A tape or fabric reinforcement installed on a stabilizer at a slider stop to  reduce wear from abrasion.  

Soft link:   A connector link constructed primarily of fabric or tape.  

Span:  The distance from one side of a canopy to the opposite side.  Measurements taken at various  distances aft of the nose will yield different results, Measurements taken across the upper surface will  typically be longer than those taken across the lower.  An average span, or separate leading and trailing  edge dimensions, may be specified.  Airfoil dimensions are assumed to be finished dimensions unless  otherwise specified.  See also  Chord .  

Stabilizer :  A fabric panel   installed at the end of a canopy ,  intended primarily to reduce wingtip vortices  (much as an end plate on an aircraft wing), and to provide some directional stability. Some stabilizer  designs are ram-air pressurized for additional rigidity.  

Tapes, Reinforcement:  A tape installed in the canopy to provide additional strength or dimensional  stability. Tapes are identified by location.  

Cross Tapes:  A reinforcing tape that runs spanwise on the upper or lower surface to distribute  loads through the canopy.  With chordwise construction, a cross tape typically runs from a line  attachment point to laterally adjacent line attachment point, although some may run from a  suspension line attachment point diagonally to a control line attachment point.  With spanwise  construction, a cross tape may be rolled into a seam joining spanwise panels.  

Leading Edge Tape:  A tape applied to or rolled into the leading edge of a upper or lower panel.   May be continuous across the span of the canopy.  

Line Attachment Reinforcement Tape:   A tape sewn chordwise into a seam at a line  attachment point.  

Load Tape:  A tape applied to a rib section and used to distribute the load from a   line attachment  to   the canopy.  When applied in a “V” may also be known as a “ V-tape .”  In some canopies, load  tapes may extend through the lower seam to become line attachment points.  

Rib Leading Edge Tape:  A tape applied to or rolled into the leading edge of a rib section.  

Trailing Edge Tape:  A tape applied to or rolled into the trailing edge seam.  Usually continuous  across the span of the canopy.  

Toggle, Control:   A grip attached to the end of the control line to allow the user an adequate handhold on  the line.  Most commonly consists of a tape/webbing loop or a hard plastic dowel.  Typically supplied as  part of the container assembly.  

Trim:   The arrangement of differential line lengths to produce a desired trim angle and anhedral.  See  also  Angle of Trim .  See Figures 1a and 1b.  

Vent, Lower Surface:   An opening in the lower surface to provide an alternate path for pressurization  during deployment (“inflation vent”) or de pressurization during flight (“accuracy vent”).

# PIA Technical Standard  

# Parachute Canopy Fabric Pull Test Non-Destructive Method  

Disclaimer: Parachute canopy manufacturers may have pull test requirements that  differ in methods, procedures, and loads applied. Test procedures specified by the  canopy manufacturer takes precedence over the test procedures described in this  document. The person performing the pull tests must determine if the canopy  manufacturer has a specific method of pull testing their canopy fabric.  

Background:  The purpose of this test method is to provide a simple, standardized, non- destructive method of verifying the strength of parachute canopy fabric.  This test method may be used when no other procedure is specified by the manufacturer.  Although this test is intended to be non-destructive, caution should be exercised as this test could damage the fabric,  if the fabric is not positioned correctly or is not secured tightly. It may also affect the fabric permeability.  

This method is designed to replace the old "Riggers' Thumb Test", first devised in response to  the "canopy acid-mesh" discovery in the mid-1980's. It is now the accepted method for all parachutes requiring canopy fabric strength tests. Reasons for testing may include:  Manufacturer’s Service Bulletins (SBs), Airworthiness Directives (AD’s), aging material, chemical contamination, UV exposure or discoloration of a suspicious origin, such as grease.

1 ea. Calibrated Spring Scale, 50 lb.   $(23\;\mathrm{kg}.$  ) minimum capacity  

This scale should be calibrated at least once a year to an accuracy of  $+/-3$   lbs. It should be identified with a serial number and written verification of calibration must be kept on file. An  adhesive label (or similar) should be affixed to the scale showing the date calibrated and the date next calibration is due. If the scale is damaged in any manner, such as dropping, it must be pulled from service and tagged as unserviceable until its recalibration.  

Test Procedures:  The following procedures do not take precedence over a manufacturer’s test procedures for their products. Before testing make sure you have the  manufacturer’s most current test procedures.  

A minimum of 2 areas should be tested on a canopy, but not less than 2 pull tests on each  separate color (1 in the warp direction and 1 in the fill direction). When testing look for areas of contamination and/or discoloration. If possible remain approximately 6 inches   $.150\mathrm{mm})$   from any seam.  

# Proceed as follows:  

# NOTE: Steps 1 and 2 apply to cases involving acid-mesh pull testing.  

1. Locate the mesh vents in the canopy and determine the fabric areas which are in contact with the mesh when the canopy is packed. These areas are shown as the diagonally shaded lines in typical tri-vent canopies (see FIGURE 2).  

2. Perform one 40 lb.   $(18~\mathrm{kg}.)$  ) pull test on each panel of material that comes in contact with the mesh when the canopy is packed. Alternate tests from the warp to fill direction on the panels. This could be as few as four tests or as many as twelve tests on some bias constructed canopies.  

CAUTION: Never attach fabric clamps or perform pull tests on the mesh covered areas of any canopy. Extensive damage will result.  

# NOTE: Steps 3 through 6 apply to all pull tests (not just acid-mesh).  

3. The area to be tested must be visibly marked for future reference. Refer to FIGURE 3 for examples of how to mark the parachute to be tested.  

4. After the marking ink has dried, attach the locking fabric clamps to the ripstop fabric as shown in FIGURE 4. The distance between the clamps should be 3 inches   $(76.2\mathrm{mm})$   plus or minus  $\%$  

# PIA-TS-108.1  

inch   $(6.35\mathrm{mm})$   and the clamps must be aligned so that the ripstop pattern is parallel (not on bias) to the edge of the jaws. Lock the clamps  VERY SECURELY .  This will prevent slippage and possible damage to the fabric.  

NOTE:  If the area to be tested is too small to allow 3 inches   $76.2\mathrm{mm})$   plus or minus  $\%$   inch  $(6.35\mathrm{mm})$  ) between the jaws of the fabric clamps (such as the apex area of a round canopy), the distance between the jaws may be reduced to 2 inches   $(50.8\mathrm{mm})$   plus or minus  $\%$   inch   $(6.35\mathrm{mm})$  .  

5. Secure one clamp to the packing table or other object which will allow a sufficient load to be applied without movement of the fabric clamp. Attach the spring scale hook to the other fabric  clamp and apply the load very smoothly and steadily. Hold the load for 3 seconds.  

6. Record test results on the tested areas in contrasting ink as shown in FIGURE 5. Information should include the following:  

• The amount of loading pulled to in pounds or kilograms • The date tested • The word PASS or FAIL • The name and certificate number of the individual performing the test.  

After completing the tests record the information in your rigger logbook and on the packing data card.

# APPENDIX 1.  MINIMUM PERFORMANCE STANDARD FOR PERSONNEL  PARACHUTE ASSEMBLIES AND COMPONENTS  

This appendix prescribes the MPS for a personnel parachute assembly and component.  The  applicable standard is PIA TS-135 Revision 1.4 issued April 22, 2010  Performance Standards for  Personnel Parachute Assemblies and Components,  as modified for this TSO:  

1.   Page 2, replace Para, 2.1.i. to read as follows:  “Cognizant Agency”  - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or civil aviation  authorities recognized in bilateral agreements by the FAA,  2.   Page 5, Para. 4.1.2.  delete: “generally” . Stitching should not ravel when broken .  “Generally” reduces the requirement for stitch  choice, and adversely impacts the current standard.    3.   Page 5 ,  Para. 4.1.3. delete: “Ref: Table  $2^{\circ}$  . Table 2 is not relevant to this requirement. Testing of a packed assy will show if the main  parachute will interfere with the proper function of the reserve parachute.  4.   Page 9 ,  Para. 4.3.7. in first sentence  delete: “a weight not more than”.   The worst case is the maximum operating weight.  5.   Page 11 ,  disregard paragraph 4.3.9.1., Rate of Descent Tests (Method 2).  

We omitted the Method (2) testing, for not providing an equivalent level of safety to            current standard. This method is directed at high performance and experience parachutists in  sport and skydiving activities.  Novice or less experienced parachutists in emergency conditions  due to incapacitation, panic, etc., may not be able to safely deploy and land.  

We have to consider the safety of all jumpers, not just the highly skilled, highly experienced.                             It is argued that the risks the experienced jumpers are exposing themselves to, are mitigated by           their skill and experience.  

To allow the increased velocity may improve the safety of highly skilled, highly experienced   jumpers, but it erodes the safety for the beginner, incapacitated, panicked, or a jumper who has  gotten himself into a treacherous landing area.  

We do not agree that a canopy manufacturer can demonstrate that a jumper can safely land with  an appropriate control manipulation while performing a flare before touchdown. This approach  relies on jumper’s experience to meet the MOPS that parachutes have been certified to.  This  approach does not provide an equivalent level of safety.  

6.  Page 14, Table 1, under Marking Data Requirements, replace:
