# Introduction  

D ee p Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a con- dit ion in which a clot, or thrombus,  ty pically forms in a deep vein in a  leg. Peopl e with a DVT may notice pain and  swelling in the leg where the clot has formed,  though smaller clots may not cause any symp- toms. The major problem occurs when a part of  the clot breaks off and flows to the lungs. This  condition, called a Pulmonary Embolus (PE),  can cause severe injury or death. DVTs are  known to occur in about 1 out of 1000 people  in the general population from all causes.  

# Traveler’s Thrombosis  

The condition has been erroneously dubbed  Economy Class Syndrome  by some people be- cause of the perception that passengers in the  more restrictive coach or economy class of  the aircraft are more likely to develop DVTs.  Recent research, however, has found that  passengers in any seating class of the aircraft  may develop a DVT. Research indicates that  any situation where one’s activity is limited  for long periods – a long automobile drive  or train ride, for instance – may contribute  to a DVT. For this reason, the term  Traveler’s  Thrombosis  is more appropriate.  

# Cause  

The precise cause of Traveler’s Thrombo- sis, while currently not clear, appears to be  related, in part, to long periods of sitting and  inactivity. The decrease in activity may lead  to inadequate circulation of the blood in the  legs. In addition, the veins may be slightly  constricted, which could also impair circula- tion in the legs.

Other conditions that alter blood flow or  normal clotting mechanisms may make some  people more likely to develop a DVT. Some of  these risk factors include a prior DVT, certain  heart diseases, cancer, pregnancy, smoking,  older age, and some blood clotting disorders.  Recent major surgery or trauma is also a risk  factor.  

Certain medications may also contribute to  formation of the thrombus. Birth control pills  and related hormones have been found to  make some people slightly more susceptible  to forming DVTs.  

# Symptoms  

Not all DVTs cause noticeable symptoms,  but the most common are swelling and redness  in the affected leg, often associated with some  pain in the same area. Severe chest pain or  problems breathing may indicate a pulmonary  embolus and should be evaluated immediately.leg image

# Treatment  

If you suspect that you may have developed  a DVT, you should immediately contact your  physician or go to an emergency room. Be  sure to mention that you have recently com- pleted a long journey, as that information may  aid in making the correct diagnosis. Different  procedures will be used to check for the pres- ence of a DVT and to evaluate a possible pul- monary embolus, if indicated. If a DVT or PE  is found, then you will usually be started on  a blood thinner to help prevent the clot from  becoming larger while it slowly resolves.  

# Prevention  

Since it has not been scientifically estab- lished that there is a direct relationship be- tween DVT and flying, there may be no need  for specific preventive methods. However,  some practices may be found to be beneficial:  

• Increasing leg muscle activity during  long periods of sitting improves blood  flow in the legs. This may include walk- ing around the cabin or exercising your  lower legs and ankles while seated. • Drinking adequate fluids, and avoiding  alcohol and caffeine, may also help by  preventing dehydration. • Loose-fitting clothing may be beneficial  in avoiding constriction of veins. • Some recommend taking short naps,  instead of long ones, to avoid prolonged  inactivity.  

If you have any of the risk factors for DVT,  consult your physician before long trips. If in- dicated by a physician, special support socks  or stockings can reduce blood pooling in the  legs and blood thinning medications may be  prescribed.

# Summary  

1. A Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a  clot that forms in a leg vein. 2. A DVT can cause harm by obstructing  blood flow to a limb or if a part of the  clot flows to the heart or lungs. 3. A DVT can be caused by some medical  problems, medications, and long periods  of inactivity. 4. The risk of developing a DVT can be  reduced by:   • Occasional muscular activity   • Maintaining hydration   • Limiting alcohol and caffeine intake   • And, if indicated by a physician:   — Support socks or stockings   — Blood-thinning medications
