Practical Risk Management for Local VFR Flying  

# PURPOSE  

Day VFR conditions are a great time to fly for fun and prac- tice. There may not appear to be much risk involved in fly- ing a known air-

craft in familiar surroundings, but com- placency can be the biggest hazard of all. This guide focuses on teaching ways to manage risk common to recreational flying.  

# PROFILE  

Accidents that occur with local flying in day VFR conditions often involve poor planning, decision-making, and risk management in areas such as:  

Operatingrules&procedures  

.Checklist use  

·Basic airplane control  

lnadequate preflight inspection  

·Fuel management  

·No weather briefing  

Poor traffic scan  

"Just thisonce"mentality  

·Fear of disappointing passengers  

# PRACTICES  

If the pilot you are training is mostly a local flyer, you might structure the flight reviewasa  $"\varsigma_{100}$  hamburger"trip to a nearby airport.  

SampleScenarios:  

1.Assigning a familiar destination offers insight into how the pilot prepares for an"easy"flight:  

·Does the pilot get a weather briefing? ·Is there a VFR flight plan? ·Are the charts current? ·How much fuel is "enough?" ·Did the pilot calculate performance? ·lsterrain a factor? ·Does the pilot recognize hazards?

2. Asking the pilot tc file aVFR flight plan or to request flight following will let you evaluate competence  

in ATC procedures. It is also a good risk management habit.  

3。 . Use a reduced throttle setting to simulate partial power and divert the flight to an unfamiliar airport. Look for a field that highlights the importance of good planning and current charts (e.g., a shorter or narrower runway, or a dif- ferent traffic pattern. Thesescenarios will provide a number of"teachable mo- ments" on abnormal procedures, sys- tems knowledge, situational awareness, For each scenario that you encounter or create, ask the pilottouse the Perceive- Process-Perform decision path to think it through. For instance:  

erceive:  

·Partial power loss is a hazard. ·What additional hazards arise with re- spect to pilot (stress); environment (ter- rain); and external pressures (concern about cost of off-field landing).  

rocess:  

·What are the consequences of continu ing to the planned destination? ·What are the available alternatives? ·Howserious is theproblem?  

erform:  

·How can you mitigate the risk of total enginefailure? ·What might let you accept the risk of continuing to the nearest airport?  

# POSTFLIGHT  

While you are enjoying the \$1oo ham- burger, start the postflight discussion by asking for the pilot's view of the flight. Letting the pilot in training speak first will give you insight on his or her deci- sion-making skills. Also, asking quesi- tons will help the pilot learn by reflect- ing on his or her actions. For example:  

·What went well? ·What would you do differently if you have a similar problem in the future?
