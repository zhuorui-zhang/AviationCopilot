# Balloon Flying Handbook  

2008  

# Preface  

This Balloon Flying Handbook introduces the basic pilot knowledge and skills that are essential for piloting balloons.  It introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot training. This  handbook is for student pilots, as well as those pursuing more advanced pilot certificates.  

Student pilots learning to fly balloons, certificated pilots preparing for additional balloon ratings or who desire to improve  their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge, and commercial balloon pilots teaching balloon students how to fly  should find this handbook helpful. This book introduces the prospective pilot to the realm of balloon flight and provides  information and guidance to all balloon pilots in the performance of various balloon maneuvers and procedures.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA). There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations  in the explanations of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept to flying  balloons. The discussions and explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally, the word  “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to  add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook also to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of  $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   and  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Performance standards for demonstrating competence required for pilot  certification are prescribed in the appropriate balloon practical test standard.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-11, Balloon Flying Handbook, dated 2001.  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from the FAA website, www.faa.gov.

# Introduction to  Balloon Flight  Training  

Purpose of Balloon Flight Training  

As outlined in this handbook, the purpose of balloon training  is to learn, develop, and refine basic balloon flight skills.  These skills include:  

•   Knowledge of the principles of flight; •   The ability to launch, operate, and land a balloon with  competence and precision; and  •   The use of good judgment that leads to optimal  operational safety and efficiency.  

Learning to fly a balloon requires a specific set of motor  skills:  

•  Coordination—the ability to take physical action in the  proper sequence to produce the desired results while  launching, flying, and landing the balloon.  •  Timing—the application of muscle coordination at  the proper time to make the flight, and all maneuvers  incident to it, a constant smooth process.  •  Control touch—the ability to interpret, evaluate, and  predict the actions and reactions of the balloon with  regard to attitude and speed variations, by interpreting  and evaluating varying visual cues and instrument  readings. •  Situational awareness—the ability to sense instantly  any reasonable variation of altitude, airspeed, and  directional change, as well as a constant perception  of relative position to ground-based structures and  planned flight track.  

A skilled pilot becomes one with the balloon and learns to  assess a situation quickly and accurately. He or she also  develops the ability to select the proper procedure to follow  in a situation, to predict the probable results of the selected  procedure, and to exercise safe practices. In addition, a skilled  pilot learns to gauge the performance of the balloon being  flown and to recognize not only personal limitations, but also  the limitations of the balloon. This knowledge helps the pilot  to avoid reaching personal or machine critical points.  

Developing the skills needed to fly a balloon requires time  and dedication on the part of the student pilot, as well as the  flight instructor. Each balloon has its own particular flight  characteristics, and it is not the purpose of balloon flight  training to learn how to fly a particular model balloon. The  purpose of balloon flight training is to develop skills and  safety habits that can be transferred to any balloon. The pilot  who acquires the necessary flight skills during training, and  demonstrates these skills by flying with precision and safe  flying habits, easily transitions to different model balloons.  Student pilots should also remember that the goal of flight  training is to develop a safe and competent pilot. To that end,  it is important for the flight instructor to insure the student  pilot forms the proper flying habits by introducing him or her  to good operating practices from the first training flight.  

# Role of the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA)  

The United States Congress has empowered the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) to promote aviation safety  by establishing safety standards for civil aviation. The  FAA accomplishes this goal through the Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR). Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 61 pertains to the certification  of pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors. 14 CFR  part 61 defines the eligibility, aeronautical knowledge, flight  proficiency, as well as training and testing requirements for  each type of pilot certificate issued.  

14 CFR part 91 contains general operating and flight rules.  The section is broad in scope and provides general guidance  in the areas of general flight rules, visual flight rules (VFR),  instrument flight rules (IFR), aircraft maintenance, and  preventive maintenance and alterations.  

Within the FAA, the Flight Standards Service promotes safe  air transportation by setting the standards for certification  and oversight of airmen, air operators, air agencies, and  designees. It also promotes safety of flight of civil aircraft  and air commerce by:  

•   Accomplishing certification, inspection, surveillance,  investigation, and enforcement; •   Setting regulations and standards; and •   Managing the system for registration of civil aircraft  and all airmen records.  

The focus of interaction between the FAA Flight Standards  Service and the aviation community and general public is  the Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  [Figure 1-1]   The FAA has approximately 130 FSDOs. These offices  provide information and services for the aviation community.  FSDO phone numbers are listed in the blue pages of the  telephone directory under United States Government  Offices, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation  Administration. Another convenient method of finding a local  office is to use the FSDO locator available on the Regulatory  Support Division’s website: http://www.faa.gov/about/ office_org/headquarters offices/avs/offices/afs/afs600.  

In addition to accident investigation and the enforcement of  aviation regulations, the FSDO is also responsible for the

Figure 1-1.  Atlanta Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  

certification and surveillance of air carriers, air operators,  flight schools and/or training centers, and airmen including  pilots and flight instructors. Each FSDO is staffed by aviation  safety inspectors (ASIs) who play a key role in making the  United States aviation system safe. They administer and  enforce safety regulations and standards for the production,  operation, maintenance, and/or modification of aircraft  used in civil aviation. They also specialize in conducting  inspections of various aspects of the aviation system, such  as aircraft and parts manufacturing, aircraft operation,  aircraft airworthiness, and cabin safety. ASIs must complete  a training program at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City  which includes airman evaluation and pilot testing techniques  and procedures. Inspectors also receive extensive on-the-job  training and they receive recurrent training on a regular basis.  The FAA has approximately 3,700 inspectors located in its  FSDO offices. All questions concerning pilot certification  (and/or requests for other aviation information or services)  should be directed to the local FSDO.  

# Role of the Designated Pilot Examiner  (DPE)  

Among other duties, ASIs are responsible for administering  FAA practical tests for pilot and flight instructor certificates  and associated ratings. The administration of these tests is  normally carried out at the FSDO level, but the agency’s  highest priority is making air travel safer by inspecting  aircraft that fly in the United States. To satisfy the need for  pilot testing and certification services, the FAA delegates  certain responsibilities to private individuals who are not FAA  employees, but designated pilot examiners (DPEs).  

A DPE is an individual, appointed in accordance with 14  CFR part 183, section 183.23, who meets the qualification  requirements of FAA Order 8710.3, Pilot Examiner’s  Handbook, and who:  

•  Is technically qualified; •  Holds all pertinent category, class, and type ratings  for each aircraft related to their designation; •  Meets the requirements of 14 CFR part 61, sections  61.56, 61.57, and 61.58, as appropriate; •  Is current and qualified to act as pilot-in-command  (PIC) of each aircraft for which they are authorized; •  Maintains at least a third-class medical certificate, if  required; and •  Maintains a current flight instructor certificate, if  required.  

Designated as a representative of the FAA Administrator  to perform specific pilot certification tasks on behalf of  the FAA, a DPE may charge a reasonable fee. Generally,  a DPE’s authority is limited to accepting applications and  conducting practical tests leading to the issuance of specific  pilot certificates and/or ratings. The majority of FAA  practical tests at the private and commercial pilot level  are administered by FAA DPEs, following FAA-provided  practical test standards (PTSs).  

Only highly qualified individuals are accepted as DPEs.  DPE candidates must have good industry reputations for  professionalism, integrity, a demonstrated willingness  to serve the public, and adhere to FAA policies and  procedures in certification matters. The FAA expects the  DPE to administer practical tests with the same degree of  professionalism, using the same methods, procedures, and  standards as an FAA ASI.  

Since there are few DPEs for balloon pilot certification, it is  important to determine early in flight training the availability  of a DPE in a particular area. It may be necessary to make  arrangements through the local FSDO for an appropriately  rated FAA ASI to administer the test for a pilot certificate.  

# Role of the Flight Instructor  

Unlike the rest of the aviation community, ballooning  has no certificated flight instructor. This role is filled by  commercially rated balloon pilots who choose to instruct  and meet the provisions of 14 CFR part 61, Commercial  Pilot Privileges and Limitations for a Balloon. In this  discussion, the term “flight instructor” is understood to mean  a commercial balloon pilot who provides instruction.  

The flight instructor is the cornerstone of aviation safety  and the FAA places full responsibility for student training  on the authorized flight instructor. It is the job of the  instructor to train the student pilot in all the knowledge  areas and teach the skills necessary for the student pilot  to operate safely and competently as a certificated pilot in  the National Airspace System (NAS). The training includes  airmanship skills, pilot judgment and decision-making, and  good operating practices.  

A pilot training program depends on the quality of the  ground and flight instruction the student pilot receives. The  flight instructor must possess a thorough understanding of  the learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of  teaching, and the ability to communicate effectively with the  student pilot. He or she uses a syllabus and teaching style  that embodies the “building block” method of instruction. In  this method, the student progresses from the known to the  unknown via a course of instruction laid out in such a way  that each new maneuver embodies the principles involved  in the performance of maneuvers previously learned. Thus,  with the introduction of each new subject, the student not only  learns a new principle or technique, but also broadens his or  her application of those principles or techniques previously  learned. Insistence on correct techniques and procedures from  the beginning of training by the flight instructor ensures that  the student pilot develops proper flying habit patterns. Any  deficiencies in the maneuvers or techniques must immediately  be emphasized and corrected.  

A flight instructor serves as a role model for the student pilot  who observes the flying habits of his or her flight instructor  during flight instruction, as well as when the instructor  conducts other pilot operations. Thus, the flight instructor  becomes a model of flying proficiency for the student who,  consciously or subconsciously, attempts to imitate the  instructor. For this reason, a flight instructor should observe  recognized safety practices, as well as regulations during all  flight operations.  

The student pilot who enrolls in a pilot training program  commits considerable time, effort, and expense to achieve a  pilot certificate. Many times a student judges the effectiveness  of the flight instructor and the success of the pilot training  program based on his or her ability to pass the requisite  FAA practical test. A competent flight instructor stresses to  the student that practical tests are a sampling of pilot ability  compressed into a short period of time. The goal of a flight  instructor is to train the “total” pilot.  

# Sources of Flight Training  

Flight training in the United States is conducted by FAA- approved pilot schools and training centers, non-certificated  (14 CFR part 61) flying schools, and independent flight  instructors. There are a limited number of part 141 balloon  training programs in the United States with most balloon  flight training being conducted by certificated commercial  balloon pilots authorized to instruct under the authority of  14 CFR section 61.133 (a)(2)(ii)(a).  

FAA-approved schools are flight schools certificated  by the FAA as pilot schools under 14 CFR part 141.  [Figure 1-2]  Application for certification is voluntary  and the school must meet stringent requirements for  personnel, equipment, maintenance, and facilities; and  teach an established curriculum which includes a training  course outline (TCO) approved by the FAA. A list of FAA  certificated pilot schools and their training courses can be  found in Advisory Circular (AC) 140-2, FAA Certificated  Pilot School Directory.  

As noted above, the major source of balloon flight training  in the United States is conducted by certificated commercial  balloon pilots. Many of these individuals offer excellent  training and meet or exceed the standards required of FAA- approved pilot schools, but not all flight instructors are equal.  It is important for a student pilot to choose a flight instructor  wisely, because a balloon flight training program is dependent  upon the quality of the ground and flight instruction the  student pilot receives.  

# Practical Test Standards (PTS)  

The FAA has developed Practical T est Standards  [Figure 1-3] for FAA pilot certificates and associated ratings. These  practical tests are administered by FAA ASIs and DPEs.  14 CFR part 61 specifies the areas of operation in which  knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the applicant.  Since the FAA requires that all practical tests be conducted  in accordance with the appropriate PTSs and the policies set  forth in the introduction section of the PTS book, the pilot  applicant should become familiar with this book during  training.  

The PTS book is a testing document and not intended to be  a training syllabus. An appropriately rated flight instructor  is responsible for training the pilot applicant to acceptable  standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and  maneuvers. Descriptions of tasks and information on how to  perform maneuvers and procedures are contained in reference  and teaching documents, such as this handbook. A list of  reference documents is contained in the introduction section  of each PTS book.

# Flight Safety Practices  

In the interest of safety and the development of good flight  habits, the flight instructor and student pilot should follow  certain basic flight safety practices and procedures in every  flight operation. These include, but are not limited to,  collision avoidance procedures including proper scanning  techniques, use of checklists, runway incursion avoidance  and other airspace operations, positive transfer of controls,  and workload management.  

# Collision Avoidance  

All pilots must be alert to the potential for midair collision and  near midair collisions. The general operating and flight rules  in 14 CFR part 91 set forth the concept of “See and Avoid.”  This concept requires that vigilance shall be maintained at all  times, by each person operating an aircraft. Pilots should also  keep in mind their responsibility for continuously maintaining  a vigilant lookout regardless of the type of balloon being flown  and the purpose of the flight. Most midair collision accidents  and reported near midair collision incidents occur in good  VFR weather conditions and during the hours of daylight.  

With regards to balloon operations, the argument can be  made that any discussion of collision avoidance applies when  dealing with operations close to the ground. When contour  flying, or during an approach to a landing site, the potential  of collision with trees, power lines, and other obstacles is  increased.  [Figure 1-4]  The techniques used in collision  avoidance can be extremely valuable, particularly in the  evolution of a balloon flight, as the pilot is perhaps exposed  more to the dangers of collision than any other aircraft.  

The “See and Avoid” concept relies on knowledge of the  limitations of the human eye, and the use of proper visual  scanning techniques to help compensate for these limitations.  The importance of, and the proper techniques for, visual  scanning should be taught to a student pilot at the very  beginning of flight training. The competent flight instructor  should be familiar with the visual scanning and collision  

![](images/f54cb062017fe400e535d9b94a008379043c1730c5f254509c59f872db308ebd.jpg)

avoidance information contained in AC 90-48, Pilot’s Role  in Collision Avoidance, and the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM).  

# Runway Incursion Avoidance  

A runway incursion is any occurrence at an airport involving  an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that  creates a collision hazard with an aircraft taking off, landing,  or intending to land.  

Most balloon flight operations are conducted away from an  airport or at airports without an operating control tower. There  may be circumstances that require the use of airport property,  either for launch or landing and recovery of the balloon.  These activities can be safely conducted at an airport, if the  balloon pilot remains aware of the movement and location  of other aircraft and ground vehicles, and also complies with  standard operating procedures and practices. The absence of  an operating airport control tower creates a need for increased  vigilance on the part of any pilot operating at those airports.  

Planning, clear communications, and enhanced situational  awareness during airport surface operations reduces the  potential for surface incidents. Safe balloon operations can  be accomplished and incidents eliminated if the pilot is  properly trained early on and, throughout his or her flying  career, complies with standard operating procedures and  practices when operating on airport property. This requires  the development of the formalized teaching of safe operating  practices during ground operations. The flight instructor is the  key to this teaching. The flight instructor should instill in the  student an awareness of the potential for runway incursion.  

# Use of Checklists  

Checklists are the foundation of pilot standardization and  safety. Checklists aid the memory and help ensure that critical  items necessary for the safe operation of the balloon are not  overlooked or forgotten. Checklists have no value if they are  not used. Pilots who fail to use checklists at the appropriate  times are relying instead on memory, become complacent,  and increase the odds of making a mistake.  

The consistent use of checklists in primary flight training  establishes habit patterns that will serve the pilot well  throughout his or her flying career. It is important that the  flight instructor promote a positive attitude toward the use  of checklists so the student pilot recognizes their importance.  At a minimum, prepared checklists should be used for the  following phases of flight:  

•  Crew Briefing and Preparation •  Layout and Assembly •  Preflight Inspection  •  Inflation  •  Passenger Briefing  •  Prelaunch Check  •  Emergency Procedures  •  Postlanding •  Recovery, Deflation, and Packing  

Checklists are covered in greater detail in Chapter 6, Layout  to Launch.  

# Positive Transfer of Controls  

It is imperative that a clear understanding exists between  the student and flight instructor of who has control of the  balloon during flight training. The flight instructor should  conduct a briefing prior to any dual training flight that  includes the procedure for the exchange of flight controls.  The following three-step process for the exchange of flight  controls is highly recommended.  

1.  When a flight instructor wishes the student to take  control of the balloon, he or she should say “You have  the flight controls.”  

2.  The student acknowledges immediately by saying, “I  have the flight controls.”  

3.  The flight instructor confirms transfer of controls by  saying, “You have the flight controls.”  

Both the flight instructor and student pilot should make a  visual check to ensure the designated person actually has the  flight controls. When the student pilot wishes to return the  controls to the flight instructor, he or she follows the same  procedure and stays on the controls until the flight instructor  says, “I have the flight controls.” There should never be any  doubt as to who is in control of the balloon. The establishment  of positive transfer of control during initial training ensures  the formation of a good flying habit.  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making  

Aeronautical decision-making (ADM) is a systematic  approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently  determine the best course of action in response to a given set  of circumstances. Learning effective ADM skills can help a  pilot offset the one unchanging factor that remains despite all  the changes in improved flight safety—the human factor. It  is estimated that 90 percent of balloon accidents are human  factors related.  

ADM builds on the foundation of conventional decision- making, but enhances the process to decrease the probability  of pilot error. ADM provides a structure to analyze changes  that occur during a flight and determine how these changes  might affect a flight’s safe outcome. This process includes  identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight,  learning to recognize and cope with stress, developing risk  assessment skills, and evaluating the effectiveness of one’s  ADM skills.  

# Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes  

A hazardous attitude, which contribute to poor pilot judgment,  can be effectively counteracted by redirecting that hazardous  attitude so that correct action can be taken. Recognition of a  hazardous thought is the first step toward neutralizing it. After  recognizing a thought as hazardous, the pilot should label  it as hazardous, then state the corresponding antidote. The  antidotes for each hazardous attitude should be memorized so  it automatically comes to mind when needed. Each hazardous  attitude with its appropriate antidote or learning modification  is shown in  Figure 1-5.  

# Learning How To Recognize and Cope With  Stress  

An important component of the ADM system is the ability to  recognize stress. Stress is a term used to describe the body’s  nonspecific response to demands placed on it. Stress can be  emotional, physical, or behavioral, and it is important for  a pilot to become knowledgeable about stress and how to  cope with it.  

# Developing Risk Assessment Skills  

An examination of the National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) reports and other accident research can help a pilot  to assess risk more effectively. For example, studies indicate  the types of flight activities that are most likely to result in  the most serious accidents. For balloons, landing accidents  consistently account for over 90 percent of the total number  of accidents in any given year.  

These accidents consistently account for the majority of  injury to pilots and damage to balloons. Accidents are more  likely during landing because the tolerance for error is greatly  diminished and opportunities for pilots to overcome errors  

![](images/92874119855a628236f67a941999535bf2f44c4e45f51d68942f23a5c5be4ba7.jpg)  
Figure 1-5.   A pilot must be able to identify hazardous attitudes and  apply the appropriate antidote when needed.  

in judgment and decision-making become increasingly  limited, particularly in high wind conditions. The most  common causal factors for landing accidents include collision  with obstructions in the intended landing area. Prior to a  flight, a pilot should assess personal fitness. The “I’m Safe  Checklist” helps a pilot determine his or her ability to fly.  [Figure 1-6]  

![](images/cd00a6f6af897fd76732f8d79d9a4f2e352f5a22303359ef064d8db88ac391de.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.  Prior to flight, a pilot should assess personal fitness,  just as he or she evaluates the balloon’s airworthiness.  

# Evaluating ADM Skills  

The “What If” discussions an instructor pilot has with a  student pilot are designed to accelerate development of  decision-making skills by posing situations for the trainee to  ponder. Research has shown that these types of discussions  help build judgment and offset low experience. Once a  student pilot has obtained his or her certification, it is  important that he or she continue to evaluate flight decisions.  To self-evaluate:  

•  Pose an open-ended question about the situation  encountered during flight, •  Examine the decision made, •  Explore other ways to solve the problem, and •  Evaluate whether or not the best solution was used.  

# Crew Resource Management  

ADM originated with the airline industry in an attempt  to reduce human factors in aircraft accidents. The airlines  developed a training program for flight crews called Crew  Resource Management (CRM). It focuses on the effective use  of all available resources to prevent accidents. While CRM  focuses on pilots operating in crew environments, many of  the concepts apply to single-pilot operations, but are not a  “best fit” for balloon operations.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management  

A variant of the CRM model that may be of more practical  application to the balloon pilot is Single-Pilot Resource  Management (SRM), which may be defined as “the art and  science of managing all resources (both from on-board and  external sources) available to the single-pilot (prior to and  during flight) to ensure the successful outcome of the flight.”  Virtually all ballooning is done as a single-pilot operation;  there is no “crew resource” available from the perspective of  having a co-pilot to assist in workload management.  

For any single pilot, the primary emphasis of SRM is to  integrate the underlying thinking skills needed by the pilot  to consistently determine the best course of action to take  in response to a given set of circumstances. SRM integrates  the following concepts:  

•  Human Resources •  Risk Management •  Situational Awareness •  Training •  Decision-Making Process  

# Human Resources  

Balloons differ from general aviation aircraft in the balloon  pilot’s reliance on diverse human resources for flight.  Human resources include all groups working with pilots  to ensure flight safety. A safe balloon flight includes, but  is not limited to, a crew chief and ground crew, weather  briefers, volunteers, spectators, “locals” with current  and often unpublished information on roads and landing  sites, landowners, and others who contribute assistance or  information. Balloons differ from airplanes in their reliance  on unlicensed, non-FAA-certified/recognized, and even first  time volunteers to assemble and support ground handling  of the balloon. Crew action—or inaction—at any stage of  flight can contribute as much or more to flight safety than  pilot input. Balloon flight safety often relies on many people  beyond those onboard.  

For example, a routine inflation on most balloons requires  several sets of hands; moderate winds can quickly mean more  help is needed. Having someone to handle a drop line offers  a pilot landing site options inaccessible through onboard  maneuvering. Added weight or “hands on” allows a pilot to  choose a smaller landing site than when landing unassisted, or  it can mean avoiding trees, power lines, or other obstacles.  

Crew members make important information contributions to  flight safety because crew can access real time flight related  information before a pilot. For example, precipitation is often  visible on the chase vehicles long before it compromises a  balloon’s inflight performance or gains a pilot’s attention.  The crew can also warn a pilot who is contour flying into  the sun of power lines downwind or of livestock behind trees  or buildings. A crew report on the current state of variable  surface conditions can alert a pilot who is descending or  landing into winds different from those of launch or flight.  Crew action can easily mean the difference between a safe  flight and an accident.  

The essential and decisive roles crew and other human  resources play in ballooning also create an ironic dilemma/ dynamic between legal and operational realities. 14 CFR  part 91 requires a pilot to act as the sole and final authority  regarding operation of the balloon, yet every pilot must rely  on crew who are not trained, certified, or even recognized  by any governing body for a flight to occur. Each pilot thus  requires and leads this integral, yet legally invisible team  on each flight. Overlooking, minimizing, or dismissing the  crew’s role opens the door to mishaps. Safety often lies in  recognizing how the crew’s skill, knowledge, and experience  complement and enhance the pilot’s own. While all final  decisions and the responsibility for safety still rest with the  pilot, this broader than usual SRM model recognizes the  human resources upon which every pilot relies for safe flight  planning and decision-making.  

# Risk Management  

Flying involves risk. To stay safe, a pilot needs to know  how to judge the level of risk, how to minimize it, and  when to accept it. The risk management decision path is  best seen through the Perceive-Process-Perform model  [Figure 1-7]  which offers a structured way to manage risk.  

Perceive hazards by looking at:  

•  Pilot experience, currency, condition; •  Aircraft performance, fuel; •  Environment (weather, terrain); and •  External factors.  

Process risk level by considering:  

•  Consequences posed by each hazard, •  Alternatives that eliminate hazards, •  Reality (avoid wishful thinking), and •  External factors (get-home-itus).  

Perform risk management:  

•  Transfer—can someone be consulted? •  Eliminate—can hazards be removed?  

![](images/4580ced035d673a9adeaac61d38c9b4a96926395730322fbaae0a1119f8a446e.jpg)  
Figure 1-7.  The Perceive-Process-Perform model.  

•  Accept—do benefits outweigh risk? •  Mitigate—can the risk be reduced?  

During each flight, decisions must be made regarding events  that involve interactions between the four risk elements—the  pilot in command, the aircraft, the environment, and the  operation.  [Figure 1-8]  One of the most important decisions a  pilot in command makes is the go/no-go decision. Evaluating  each of these risk elements can help a pilot decide whether a  flight should be conducted or continued. Below is a review of  the four risk elements and how they affect decision-making.  

•  Pilot—a pilot must continually make decisions about  his or her competency, condition of health, mental  and emotional state, level of fatigue, etc. For example,  a pilot may plan for an early morning flight after an  all night drive, which means little sleep. Tired, achy,  congested from the beginnings of a cold, is that pilot  safe to fly?  

•  Balloon—a pilot frequently bases decisions on the  evaluations of the balloon, such as performance,  equipment, or airworthiness. A pilot is on an afternoon  flight in a rural area. Landing areas are becoming sparse  because the terrain is mostly swampland. The wind  is decreasing and sunset is only half and hour away.  Should he or she continue to fly over this terrain?  

•  Environment—this encompasses many elements not  pilot or balloon related. It includes, but is not limited  to, such factors as weather, terrain, launch and landing  areas, and surrounding obstacles. Weather is one  element that can change drastically over time and  

![](images/55e6f4130e4190e30d97db88fc5e5b240e0439bd0093637a0dc6d108d6d59084.jpg)  
Figure 1-8.  When situationally aware, a pilot has an overview of the total operation and is not fixated on one perceived significant  factor.  

distance. During an afternoon flight with an indefinite  ceiling, slight precipitation and the rumble of thunder  is encountered. Should the pilot stay aloft, trusting  the weather briefing’s assertion that “there is no  precipitation in the area,” or land at the first available  site as soon as possible?  

•  Operation—the interaction between the pilot, the  balloon, and the environment is greatly influenced  by the purpose of each flight operation. The pilot  must evaluate the three previous elements to decide  on the desirability of undertaking or continuing the  flight as planned. It is worth asking why the flight is  being made, how critical it is to maintain the original  intent, and if the continuation of the flight is worth  the risks?  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception and  understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four  fundamental risk elements that affect safety before, during,  and after the flight. To maintain situational awareness, a  pilot needs to understand the relative significance of these  factors and their future impact on the flight. When a pilot  is situationally aware, he or she has an overview of the  total operation.  

Some obstacles to maintaining situational awareness include  (but are not limited to) fatigue, stress, and work overload;  complacency; and classic behavioral traps such as the  drive to meet or exceed flight goals. Situational awareness  depends on the ability to switch rapidly between a number of  different, and possibly competing, information sources and  tasks while maintaining a collective view of the environment.  Experienced pilots are better able to interpret a situation  because of their base of experience, but newer pilots can  compensate for lack of experience with the appropriate  fundamental core competencies acquired during initial  and recurrent flight training. SRM training helps the pilot  maintain situational awareness, which enables the pilot  to assess and manage risk and make accurate and timely  decisions. To maintain situational awareness, all of the skills  involved in ADM are used.  

# The Decision-Making Process  

Understanding the decision-making process provides a  foundation for developing the necessary ADM skills. Some  situations, such as an extinguished pilot light, require an  immediate response using established procedures. While  pilots are well trained to react to emergencies, they are not  as prepared to make decisions that require a more reflective  response. The ability to examine any changes that occur  during a flight, gather information, and assess risk before  reaching a decision constitutes the steps of the decision- making process.  

# Deﬁning the Problem  

Problem definition is the first step in the decision-making  process. Defining the problem begins with recognizing a  change has occurred or an expected change did not occur.  A problem is perceived first by the senses and then is  distinguished through insight and experience. This “gut”  reaction, coupled with an objective analysis of all available  information, determines the exact nature and severity of  the problem.  

# Choosing a Course of Action  

After the problem has been identified, the pilot must evaluate  the need to react to it and determine the actions that need  to be taken to resolve the situation in the time available.  The expected outcome of each possible action should be  considered and the risks assessed before deciding on a  response to the situation.  

# Implementing Decisions and Evaluating the  Outcomes  

Although a decision may be reached and a course of action  implemented, the decision-making process is not complete.  It is important to think ahead and determine how the decision  could affect other phases of the flight. As the flight progresses,  a pilot must continue to evaluate the outcome of the decision  to ensure that it is producing the desired result.  

# The DECIDE Model  

A common approach to decision-making for the last decade  has been the rational choice model. This concept holds that  good decisions result when a pilot gathers all the information  related to a particular scenario, reviews it, analyzes the options  available, and decides on the best course of action to follow.  

The DECIDE Model, a six-step process intended to provide  the pilot with a logical way of approaching decision-making,  is an example of this concept. The six elements of the  DECIDE Model represent a continuous loop process to  assist a pilot in decision-making. If a pilot uses the DECIDE  Model in all decision-making, it becomes natural and results  in better decisions being made under all types of situations.  [Figure 1-9]  

![Figure 1-9.   The DECIDE Model can provide a framework for  effective decision-making. ](images/4b01b069159e709bcbe17fd2e9ac47ce65dd50711324502b8feab98dbdeee17e.jpg)  

# The OODA Loop  

Colonel John Boyd, USAF (Retired), coined the term and  developed the concept of the “OODA Loop” (Observation,  Orientation, Decision, Action).  [Figure 1-11]  The ideas,  words, and phrases contained in Boyd’s briefings have  penetrated not only the United States military services, but  the business community and academia around the world.  The OODA Loop is now used as a standard description of  decision-making cycles.  

The OODA Loop is an interlaced decision model which  provides immediate feedback throughout the decision- making process. For SRM purposes, an abbreviated version  of the concept  [Figure 1-10]  provides an easily understood  

![](images/ad5f89699739219fe4bf01872d8c9a5b8326ce245de8b2cb9f11e8811bb0bbba.jpg)  
Figure 1-10.   The four nodes of OODA Loop decision-making.  

tool for the balloon pilot.  

The first node of the OODA Loop,  Observe,  reflects the need  for situational awareness. A balloon pilot must be aware of  those things around him or her that may impact the flight.  Continuous monitoring of wind, weather, ground track, balloon  responses, and so forth provide a constant reference point by  which the pilot knows his or her starting point on the loop. This  permits the ability to immediately move to the next step.  

Orient,  the second node of the OODA Loop, focuses the  pilot’s attention on one or more discrepancies in the flight.  For example, while contour flying over trees, the balloon  passes the edge of the tree line and begins a gradual descent.  The pilot is aware of this deviation and considers available  options in view of potential hazards to continued flight.  

The pilot then moves to the third node,  Decide,  in which he  or she determines the action to create a specific desired effect.  That decision is made based on experience and knowledge of  potential results of a particular action. The pilot then  Acts  on  that decision, making a physical input to cause the balloon  to react in the desired fashion.  

Once the OODA Loop has been completed, the pilot is once  again in the Observe position. Assessment of the resulting  action is added to the previously perceived aspects of the  

Twenty minutes into the flight, Dave notices  frost forming on the outside of the fuel fitting  leading to the burner. Since he cannot  tighten the fitting (it is a fixed fitting), he  decides to shut off the fuel on that side, vent  the line, and land as soon as practicable in  accordance with the established “emer- gency” procedure.  

Dave has received his weather information  for an afternoon flight, and finds the winds  are forecast to stay above 7 mph until just  before sunset. He goes ahead with planning  the flight, believing the winds will decrease,  and will soon be going out to the launch site  to start preparations for launch.  

In this example, Dave is in the  Observe   part of the decision cycle. He will continue  to  Observe  until he detects a condition that  would cause him to cancel the flight. Dave  has completed a full cycle of the OODA  Loop, but has returned to the  Observe   node to continue to monitor the weather.  

Here, Dave has completed an entire  Decision  cycle in a very short time due to  the circumstances of the situation. He will  now move to the  Act  node, and will take  action to resolve the issue before it causes  danger to him or his passenger.  

Upon reaching the launch site, Dave checks  the winds using a pibal and finds that winds  are decreasing. He believes a flight can be  safely conducted, and goes ahead with his  launch plans. After launch, Dave finds that  the winds are in a direction that is not quite  what was forecast, and are taking him into  an area with few good landing areas. He  continues the flight, and watches the  direction closely to detect any  further  change of direction.  

While making an approach to land, Dave’s  passenger, Pat, alerts him to powerlines  running across the near side of the small  field. Dave evaluates his approach and  Acts  to land accordingly, knowing that  winds may shift somewhat as he descends.  He touches down well past the powerlines,  never having put him or his passenger at  risk, and has an uneventful deflation.  

Dave again completed an OODA Loop  decision-making cycle. Had there been an  indication that the approach could not be  safely completed, Dave could have made a  decision to abort the landing  (Decide),  and  then performed an  Act  to effect a change.  

In this example, Dave has completed an  OODA decision-making cycle, and has  returned to the  Orient  node. He will  continue to monitor the situation, being  aware of changes, and is prepared to make  a decision when the situation warrants.  

flight to further define the flight’s progress. The advantage  of the OODA Loop Model is that it may be cumulative.  Also, multiple cycles in different stages of completion may  be occurring at any given point in the flight.  

# Balloon Certiﬁcate Eligibility  Requirements  

To be eligible to fly a balloon solo, an applicant must be at  least 14 years of age and demonstrate satisfactory aeronautical  knowledge on a test developed by a flight instructor. Flight  training must be received and logged for the maneuvers and  procedures in 14 CFR part 61 that are appropriate to the  make and model of aircraft to be flown. Only after all of  these requirements are met can a flight instructor endorse a  student's certificate and logbook for solo flight.  

To be eligible for a sport pilot certificate with a balloon  endorsement, an applicant must be at least 16 years of age,  complete the specific training and flight time requirements  described in 14 CFR part 61, pass a knowledge test,  and successfully complete a practical test. A sport pilot  certificate with balloon endorsement authorizes piloting  a balloon with a maximum takeoff gross weight of 1,320  pounds or less. Satisfactory proficiency and safety must  also be demonstrated.  

To be eligible for a private pilot certificate with a balloon  rating, an applicant must be at least 16 years of age, complete  the specific training and flight time requirements described  in 14 CFR part 61, pass a knowledge test, and successfully  complete a practical test.

NOTE: A commercial pilot with a balloon category and  class rating may instruct, and is authorized to do so under  the provisions of his or her certificate.  

If a pilot currently holds a pilot certificate for a powered  aircraft and wants to add a balloon category rating on that  certificate, he or she is exempt from the knowledge test,  but must satisfactorily complete the flight training and  practical test. Certificated balloon pilots are not required  to hold an airman medical certificate to operate a balloon  within the United States. Flights in foreign countries fall  under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  regulations, and a medical certificate is generally required.  

For private pilots working toward the commercial pilot  certificate, the regulatory requirement is ten additional hours  of flight training, per the provisions of 14 CFR part 61.  Flight time logged as instructional time towards the initial  certification may not, under most circumstances, be counted  towards that time which must be accumulated toward the  commercial rating.  

# Introduction to Integrated Airman  Certiﬁcation and/or Rating Application  (IACRA)  

The Integrated Airman Certification and/or Rating  Application (IACRA) is an online application system that  allows for the issuance of student, private, and commercial  certificates without generating paperwork; all certificate  application and approval is done through the use of electronic  signatures. IACRA interfaces with multiple databases to  validate data and verify specific fields of information, and  upon completion of the approval process, forwards the data  automatically to the Airman Certification Branch.  

In order to utilize the system, an applicant must first register  at http://acra.faa.gov/iacra/. This registration process results  in the issuance of an FAA Tracking Number (FTN). This  number becomes the applicant’s registration number for all  future utilization of the system, so it is important to keep it  for future reference and action.  

Upon completion of all training requirements, the student  pilot (which refers to both the student applying for a private  certificate, as well as the private pilot upgrading to the  commercial certificate) makes application through the IACRA  web site. The FAA Form 8710-1 is completed online in several  steps. When complete, the form is submitted to the central  server at the FAA Airman Certification Branch in Oklahoma  City. If the form is accepted at the server, the applicant is issued  an application ID number for future reference.  

The instructor, who has previously enrolled in the IACRA  system as a recommending instructor, uses the applicant’s  FTN to retrieve the application for review. It is also the  responsibility of the instructor to attach the results of the  student’s written test to the IACRA file, using the Exam  ID, which is usually found in the upper right portion of  the printed results. Once the recommending instructor has  reviewed the application, and the results are attached, the  application is again sent to the central server at the Airman  Certification Branch.  

At the appropriate time, the examiner retrieves the applicant’s  application from the central server, verifies the individual’s  identification, and administers the practical test. IACRA has  provisions for the issuance of a temporary airman certificate,  notice of discontinuance, or notice of disapproval. When the  evaluation is completed, and the examiner has completed  the appropriate processing, the file is again returned to the  Airman Certification Branch. Upon successful completion, the  permanent certificate is prepared and forwarded to the pilot.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provides an overview of the FAA, the flight  instructor, and DPE’s roles in the qualification and licensing  of lighter-than-air pilots. Additionally, the regulatory  requirements for both ground and aeronautical training have  been outlined.  

The reader has also been given some basic information and  techniques concerning flight safety practices and aeronautical  decision-making. This information is not exhaustive; the  student pilot would be well advised to avail himself or  herself of other materials published by the FAA and other  organizations.  

# Hot Air Balloon Design,  Systems, and Theory  

# Introduction  

This chapter presents an introduction to the history of flying  balloons, the physics of balloon flight, balloon components, balloon  terminology, support equipment, and how to choose a balloon.  

# History  

Hot air balloons are the oldest successful human flight  technology. The first recorded manned balloon flight was made  on November 21, 1783 in a hot air balloon developed by the  Montgolfier brothers of France.  [Figure 2-1]  Flown by Pilatre de  Rozier and the Marquis d’Arlandes, the flight lasted 23 minutes  and covered 5.5 miles. Although the Montgolfiers are given credit  for the first documented flight, there are some earlier claims. The  Chinese are credited with using manned kites, and perhaps hot  air balloons, some 2,000 years ago, and the Nazcas of Peru may  have used smoke-filled balloons.  

![](images/45a13fba06b4b3d82b0da8e908ebc64b43dd749665131f3bd22a8bbd44b898be.jpg)  

![](images/6a88711cd071da0d40b8440d4efa00ae3b6ea4f2961611f7a1c5f242897589f2.jpg)  
Figure 2-1.  Model of the Montgolfier brothers balloon.  

T en days after the successful flight of the Montgolfier balloon,  a young physicist, Professor Jacques Charles flew the first  gas balloon made of a varnished silk envelope filled with  hydrogen. His flight lasted two hours and covered 27 miles,  reaching an altitude of 9,000 feet. Begun as an attempt to  duplicate and validate the achievements of the Montgolfier  brothers, Charles based his experiment on misinformation. He  mistakenly believed the Montgolfier brothers used hydrogen  to inflate their balloon, so he used hydrogen. Thus, the two  kinds of balloons flown today—hot air and gas—were  developed in the same year.  

Gas ballooning became a sport for the affluent and flourished  on a small scale in Europe and the United States. Since  ballooning drew crowds, one way to offset the cost of a  flight was to charge admission. Ballooning was a perilous  undertaking that drew male and female daredevils eager to  court danger. The parachute, invented by balloonist Andre  Garnerin in 1797 as the means of performing a daring stunt,  is probably ballooning’s most significant contribution to  flight.  

At the turn of the century, the smoke balloon (a canvas  envelope heated by fire on the ground) was a common county  fair opening event. As the smoke balloon ascended, a man or  woman rider balanced on a trapeze attached to the balloon.  

After the initial climb (about 3,000 feet per minute (fpm))  the hot air cooled and the rider separated from the balloon,  deploying a parachute to return to earth.  

Balloons also found a home with the military. Napoleon  used anchored observation balloons in some of his battles  and considered using balloons to ferry troops in his proposed  invasion of England. During the American Civil War, both  the North and South used tethered observation balloons. In  Europe, balloons were used during the 1870 siege of Paris  (Franco-Prussian War) to carry messages and important  people out of Paris. World War I saw balloons used by  both sides for artillery spotting. By World War II, airplanes  had replaced balloons for observation and reconnaissance  purposes although barrage balloons (several large balloons  tethered close together) were often used to discourage low  level bombers or dive bombers. The United States Navy  contracted with the General Mills Company in the 1950s to  develop a small hot air balloon for military purposes. The  Navy never used the balloon, but the project created the  basis for the modern hot air balloon. With the use of modern  materials and technology, hot air ballooning has become an  increasingly popular sport.  

# Physics  

In concept, the balloon is the simplest of all flying machines.  It consists of a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is lighter  than the surrounding atmosphere. Since air in the envelope  is less dense than its surroundings, it rises, taking the basket  filled with passengers or payload with it. A balloon is distinct  from other aircraft in that it travels by moving with the  wind and cannot be propelled through the air in a controlled  manner.  

There are two main types of balloons, hot air and gas, but  other specialty type balloons are also flown. The Rozier  balloon is an example of a less common balloon. A hybrid  balloon that utilizes both heated and unheated lifting gases  for long distance record flights, a Rozier was flown by Steve  Fossett in his record-setting first solo circumnavigation in  2002. A recent addition to the hot air balloon field is the solar  balloon, which uses heat radiation from the sun to provide  lift. This handbook primarily covers hot air balloons.  

# Why Do Balloons Fly?  

The physics of balloon flight is based on the principles of  fluid dynamics and associated theorems. Therefore, it is  helpful to think of the air, the medium of balloon flight, as a  fluid when discussing the concept of “buoyancy” as applied  to balloon flight. In physics, buoyancy is the upward force  of an object produced by the surrounding fluid (i.e., liquid  or gas) in which it is fully or partially immersed, due to the  pressure difference of the fluid between the top and bottom  

![](images/2300ff833e8cd0471a720fd700a66faa73827ba477b565a519b6563d29da2e1f.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.   The air inside the balloon envelope is heated to create  buoyancy.  

of the object. The net upward buoyancy force is equal to the  magnitude of the weight of fluid displaced by the object. This  force enables the object to float or at least to appear lighter.  An object must make room for its own volume by pushing  aside, or displacing, an equal volume of liquid. For example,  an aircraft carrier exerts downward force on the water and  the water exerts upward force on the aircraft carrier. A solid  object floats when it has displaced just enough water, or air  in the case of a balloon, to equal its own original weight.  

To create the necessary buoyancy for flight, the air inside the  balloon envelope is heated which causes the air to expand,  making it less dense.  [Figure 2-2]  Once the interior air weighs  less than the non-heated ambient air (air that surrounds an  object), the balloon becomes lighter in weight and rises in an  effort to find a level where the interior air density matches  that of the exterior air density. The envelope is carried along  “for the ride,” as it does little more than contain the heated  air mass. The balloon rises to a point where the lift created  by the action of heating the air is equal or greater than that of  the balloon itself. The balloon rises because it has reached a  state of “positive buoyancy” and the amount of lift is greater  than the weight of the balloon.  

The greater the heat differential between the air inside the  envelope and the ambient air, the faster the balloon rises. Hot  air is constantly being lost from the top of the envelope by  leaking through the fabric, seams, and deflation port. Heat is  also lost by radiation. Only the best and newest fabrics are  nearly airtight. Some fabrics become increasingly porous  with age and some colors radiate heat faster than others  do. Under certain conditions, some dark colored envelopes  may gain heat from the sun. To compensate for heat loss,  prolonged flight is possible only if fuel is carried on board  to make heat.  

The internal temperature of the air in the envelope is raised  or lowered to change altitude. To climb, the temperature in  the envelope is raised by heating the air which creates more  lift. To descend, the air in the envelope is allowed to cool.  Cooling of the envelope is also possible by allowing hot air  to escape through a vent. This temporary opening closes  and seals automatically, due to the upward pressure, when  it is not in use.  

A balloon’s weight when in flight is not only the figure as  stated in the flight manual, but also includes the weight of  the air within the inflated envelope, the balloon components  and equipment, as well as the pilot and passengers. The  average 77,000 cubic foot hot air balloon contains an air mass  that weighs over 3,000 pounds. By adding all these factors  together, it is easy to understand how weight influences the  balloon’s response to pilot actions during flight maneuvers.  The weight and sheer momentum of a balloon in flight make  it difficult for a pilot to effect rapid changes.  

# Balloon Components  

A hot air balloon consists of three main components:  envelope, heater system, and basket. In addition, flight  instruments, fuel tanks, and other support equipment are  needed for a safe balloon flight.  [Figure 2-3]  The most  common ballooning terms are used in the following text, in  

![](images/8be0535e3e7f2b5995dee51ce970da9ae7fa1303ff23d1f410bea3eb3fa078a1.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Basic balloon terms.  

the generic illustrations ,  and are also listed in the glossary  which contains balloon and aeronautical terminology. Some  terms and names used by manufacturers are also included.  

# Envelope  

The envelope is usually made of light-weight and strong  synthetic fabrics such as ripstop nylon or Dacron ® . The  material is cut into panels which are sewn together in vertical  rows that are called gores due to their triangular shape.  The traditional envelope shape is a teardrop. The gores  are reinforced with sewn-in webbing called horizontal and  vertical structural load tapes which are continuous to the  top center of the balloon where they are sewn into a load  ring. Galvanized, stainless steel, or Kevlar ®  cables transfer  basket loads to load tapes which in turn support the load.  The nylon “skirt” at the base of the envelope is coated with  special fire resistant material to keep the flame from igniting  the balloon.  

The deflation port is located at the top of the envelope and  allows for the controlled release of hot air. It is covered by  the deflation panel sometimes called a top cap, parachute  top, or spring top.  [Figure 2-4]  In a balloon with a parachute  top, partial opening of the parachute valve is the normal way  to cool the balloon. Balloons with other types of deflation  panels may have a cooling vent in the side or the top. Many  balloons are also equipped with turning vents, which allow  for the pilot to turn the balloon on its vertical axis while in  

![](images/4e0247d165be9b705df71c1e040e0ec14ec910371f29300712ab806304d0c6cc.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.  Deflation system.  

flight. Turning vents help a pilot align the basket for landing,  or in the case of commercial balloons, align the balloon’s  logo toward the crowd.  

# Special Shape Balloons  

Balloons that do not have a traditional “teardrop” shape are  called special shape balloons.  [Figure 2-5]  They may be  completely engineered systems which have been designed to  resemble cans, sports balls, cartoon characters, cars, etc.  

![](images/ef25f4da3184072733a11d769dc6e9adfa9039639e5edf7433112dad44953090.jpg)  
Figure 2-5.  Special shape balloons.  

Some balloons have appendages added to the envelope.  Appendages are pieces added to a balloon envelope in order  to create a particular shape or rendition, not necessarily  keeping with a standard shape balloon. To be designated  an appendaged envelope, less than 10 percent of the total  capacity of the balloon is contained within the appendage.  While the appendaged envelope has the same general flight  characteristics as a standard balloon shape, there are some  differences. For example, the added weight of the appendage  may cause the overall envelope to weigh significantly more  than teardrop balloons of equal size. Appendage balloons  also have the tendency to rotate during aggressive climbs  and descents.  

A special shape envelope requires a substantial amount of  engineering to ensure the envelope is properly stressed,  and the balloon has no undesirable flight characteristics  due to the shape. Special shape balloons built in the United  States or the United Kingdom are normally issued Standard  Airworthiness Certificates, but special shape balloons  imported from other manufacturers in other countries may  be issued an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate. A  balloon with an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate  usually may not be flown for compensation or hire, which  negates the marketability of such a balloon. Additionally, an  experimental balloon may not be flown over congested areas,  per Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 91, section 91.319. Experimental balloons also require  specific documentation when flown outside of an area of 50  miles from its home port. Pilots of special shape balloons with  an Experimental Airworthiness Certificate should coordinate  their activities with their local Flight Service District Office  to avoid problems.  

# Thermal Airships  

A thermal airship combines the characteristics of a hot air  balloon, with respect to lifting force, and an airship, with  respect to its capacity of being steered while in flight. To  develop proficiency in this aircraft, knowledge is required  of not only hot air balloon operations and physics, but also  of airship operations. It is estimated that there are currently  less than 10 of these aircraft in the United States, and there  is no specific pilot certificate for thermal airships. These  aircraft are extremely expensive to purchase, and have some  significant operating limitations with reference to winds. Any  further discussion is outside the scope of this handbook.  

# Heater System  

The heater system consists of propane burners (one or more),  fuel tanks that store liquid propane, and fuel lines that carry  the propane from the tanks to the burners. The burners convert  ambient air into hot air, which in turn provides the lift required  for flight.  [Figures 2-6  and  2-7]  

![](images/f5163c4bf11e0c0008950a8cd92bd903b5b48074a72071bbd7ac10e2350fda59.jpg)

Figure 2-7.  Typical double heater (burner).  

Propane fuel is used to heat the air which generates buoyancy  for flight. The propane is stored in one or more fuel tanks  located in the basket. A withdrawal tube attached to the liquid  tank valve permits liquid propane to be drawn from the bottom  of the fuel tanks. The liquid propane is supplied to the burner  assembly through the fuel hoses that connect the fuel tanks to  the heater assembly (commonly referred to as the burner). The  fuel system also provides propane to the pilot light.  

There are two types of pilot light systems: liquid and vapor.  In a liquid pilot light system, liquid propane is diverted from  the main supply line at the heater via a pilot shut-off valve.  The fuel goes through a vapor converter and regulator, and  is distributed through a pilot head. A piezo-electric system  ignites the vapor at inflation for most heaters, but many  balloonists choose to use a striker.  

In a vapor pilot light, a second fuel hose is used to supply  vapor to the heater assembly pilot light from the pilot light  tank valve located on top of the fuel tank. A regulator is used  to decrease the pressure of the propane vapor for proper pilot  operation. A pilot light valve located on the heater controls  the flow of propane vapor to the pilot light.  

The main liquid tank valve controls the flow of liquid propane  to the burner, while the blast valve controls fuel flow at the  heater. With the liquid tank valve open, opening the burner  blast permits liquid propane to enter the heat exchange coil  where it is either completely or partially vaporized. After  exiting the heat exchange coil through the orifices in the  lower portion of the coil, the propane is ignited by the pilot  light.  [Figure 2-8]  

T o meet redundancy requirements, heaters have a secondary  system which allows for operation at a reduced efficiency  should a problem develop with the main blast valve. These  backup, or bypass systems generally have proprietary names  unique to the individual manufacturers. Pilots should consult  individual flight manuals for an explanation of their use.  

The heaters typically have an output of approximately 20  million British thermal units (BTU) in use. There is a power  loss associated with altitude, generally considered to be four  percent per thousand feet of altitude. This is particularly  important when dealing with higher density altitudes.  Pilots accustomed to flying at lower altitudes are frequently  surprised by the decreased performance of their balloon upon  their first flight at a higher altitude.  

# Basket  

Wicker is the preferred material for the passenger compartment  basket of a hot air balloon because it is sturdy, flexible, and  relatively lightweight.  [Figure 2-9]  The flexibility of wicker  

![](images/067c2dd4227e094de70a6cb7c882fbd6d37e5519bbcdcf5c5614d0160950488c.jpg)

Figure 2-9.  Representative sport basket configuration.  

helps with balloon landings and cushions some of the  impact force at landing. The basket contains the fuel tanks,  instruments, pilot, and passengers.  

Aluminum, stainless steel, or flexible nylon poles (in  conjunction with stainless steel cables) located on the upper  portion of the structure transfer the basket load to the envelope  attachment points and support the burner assembly. Quick  pins or aircraft bolts connect the support tubes, with nylon  rods usually inserted into the sockets, and the cables attached  around them. Lower frame tubes support the floor, permitting  the floor load to be transferred to the lower frames. Oak  skids, usually affixed to the floor, add rigidity and provide a  point of abrasive resistance to the floor. Rattan sidewalls of  varying thickness, design, and color surround and protect the  passengers, equipment, and fuel tanks. Larger baskets, usually  found on large ride balloons, may have padded basket dividers  to form passenger compartments.  

# Instruments  

As required by 14 CFR part 31, balloons are equipped with  an altimeter, a rate of climb indicator, fuel quantity gauges,  and an envelope temperature gauge. Many newer balloons use  some type of electronic instrument system, but older balloons  may still be equipped with traditional, pressure driven analog  instruments.  

The most common arrangement of instruments is a small  pod or package which includes the altimeter, rate of climb  indicator (variometer or vertical speed indicator), and the  envelope temperature gauge (pyrometer). A cable is plugged  into the instrument package during the preflight or layout  process which connects to a sensor located in the top of the  balloon and operates the envelope temperature gauge. Fuel  quantity gauges, located on the top portion of each fuel tank,  provide a reference for the quantity of fuel remaining in the  tank. As these gauges are mechanical, they are sometimes  inaccurate, and in most configurations do not read from 0 to  100 percent. This needs to be taken into consideration during  the flight planning process.  

In recent years, many manufacturers have added a wireless  system that transmits the temperature signal to a receiver in  the basket via a radio or infrared signal. This eliminates the  necessity of a wire being located in the balloon envelope.  These instrument systems are popular, but have reliability  issues because radio interference or the thermal “plume” from  the burner can degrade the signal transmission.  

# Fuel Tanks  

Balloons generate heat through the use of propane. The  propane is contained in aluminum or stainless steel tanks  mounted inside the basket. These tanks may be either  vertical or horizontal, and contain 10, 15, or 18 gallons of  propane. Larger tanks are available for larger ride balloons.  [Figure 2-10]  

The tanks, sometimes referred to as pressure vessels, are  commonly equipped with a service valve (or main liquid  valve), a fixed maximum liquid level gauge (or “spit valve”),  a float gauge, and a pressure relief valve. The service valve  regulates the flow of the liquid propane to the heater. The fixed  maximum liquid level gauge provides an indication that the  tank is filled to its maximum design quantity, or 80 percent  of the total capacity of the tank. The float gauge provides a  reading of the remaining capacity of the tank in a percentage.  The pressure relief valve allows for the release of propane  from the tank should the tank exceed the maximum design  pressure. A pressure relief valve normally releases at 375  pounds per square inch (psi).  Figure 2-11  provides additional  information on propane management.

# Propane Primer  

Propane is a liquefied petroleum gas. Propane is preferred over butane and other hydrocarbons in balloon design  because propane has a lower boiling point (propane  ${\it44}\ ^{\circ}F_{\circ}$   butane  $32\ ^{\circ}\!F_{\!\circ}$  ), and, therefore, a consistently higher vapor  pressure for a given temperature. Under ideal circumstances, a gallon of propane produces 91,600 BTU of heat.  

In its gaseous form, propane is odorless. However, an odorant (a strong smelling chemical compound) is added to  propane to indicate the leakage of even small quantities of gas. The odorant normally added to propane, ethyl mercaptan,  loses its odor when burned. Tanks should never be stored in an enclosed area, or near a heater and/or a device with  a pilot light. Propane vapor is heavier than air, and will collect in low areas. Concentrated propane vapor constitutes  an explosive hazard.  

There is a popular misconception that propane is always at -44   $^{\circ}\!F$   when stored. This is incorrect—the propane, in the  tank, is the same temperature as the ambient air. Propane turns cold when vaporizing, due to heat exchange.  

The combustion of propane yields carbon dioxide and water.  

The balloonist should be aware of the large volume of combustible mixture that will result from the escape of a small  amount of liquid propane. As a rough approximation, a given volume of liquid propane produces a combustible mixture  6,800 times the original liquid propane volume.  

The propane cylinder raises the boiling point of propane by trapping the pressure built up by the vaporized propane.  Any given temperature will produce a specific pressure within the propane cylinder. This balance between temperature  and pressure is referred to as the point of equilibrium. As long as the propane cylinder is neither completely full nor  completely empty of the liquefied fuel, and no foreign substance such as air is present, the pressure within the cylinder  is dependent upon the prevailing temperature of the liquid, and not upon the amount of liquid propane within the  cylinder. Therefore, maintaining a proper propane temperature is necessary to supply sufficient fuel pressure to the  burner. The temperature-pressure point of equilibrium is only applicable to containers containing vapor over the liquid.  While propane vapor is easily compressible, propane liquid is practically incompressible.  

Butane-propane mixtures can be a problem. At certain times of the year in certain areas, butane will be mixed with  propane to increase its boiling point. A butane-propane mixture will produce a more yellow, sooty flame, may tend to  go out when the blast valve is pulled, and the pressure available for a given temperature will be less.  

Burners commonly used in hot air balloons are vaporizer burners. A vaporizer burner combines a vaporizer with  a burner into a single unit where burner heat is used to vaporize the liquid propane being fed into the burner. The  vaporizer normally consists of a coil in direct contact with the burner flame. If there is no fuel flow through one of the  coils during burner operation, the coil may be damaged as a result of overheating.  

The heat output of a burner is one of the parameters that indicate how a given balloon will perform in flight. A long  sustained burn will produce a lower rating that the same time increment broken up into short burns. The lower output  for a sustained burn is due to the inertia of the fuel, the friction hindering fuel flow, and pressure decay due to the  withdrawal of liquid propane from the cylinder.  

Periodic inspections of the airborne heating system should include a visual inspection of the hoses and fittings, and a  high pressure leak check with a test gauge adaptor.

# Support Equipment  

Standard support equipment for ballooning includes an inflation  fan, transport/chase vehicle, and small miscellaneous items,  such as igniters, drop lines, gloves, spare parts, and helmets.  

# Inflation Fans  

The inflation fan is one of the most dangerous pieces of  equipment in ballooning.  [Figure 2-12]  Keep this fact in mind  when purchasing and operating any inflation fan. Fan blades  have been known to shatter or break, throw rocks at high  velocity, and inadequate cages or guards fail to protect fingers  and hands. Any fan considered for purchase by a prospective  pilot should be evaluated for potential safety hazards. Also,  remember that the blade spinning at high revolutions per  minute (rpm) generates a significant gyroscopic effect. Fans  should not be moved while running. If the fan must be moved,  it should be shut off, repositioned, and restarted.  

Fans come in different styles and sizes. Personal finances,  style of inflation, and size of the balloon determines the best  fan. Points to consider in selecting a fan are:  

•   Weight—someone has to lift the fan into and out of  the transport vehicle. Wheels help one person move  the fan, but they add to the weight and are not helpful  on soft ground. One person can carry a small fan, but  a larger fan may require two people.  •   Safety—fan blades today can be wood, aluminum,  fiberglass, or composite, with wood being the  most popular. Wood or aluminum blades designed  specifically for balloon fan use are best. The fan should  

![](images/2391126d9161d1e6512a1bfe04a23e484806a46bc611eefe7717d8fa05b190b1.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.  Balloon inflation using a typical inflation fan.  

have a cowling of fiberglass or metal because a cage  or grill alone is not sufficient to stop rocks or pieces  of blade from being thrown.  

•   Transport—available space in a pickup truck, the back  of a van, or on a trailer may determine the size of the  fan.  •   Cubic feet per minute (CFM)—fan blade design, duct  design, and engine speed determine the amount of air  moved in a given time. Do not confuse engine size with  CFM. Larger engines do not necessarily push more  air. The volume of air moved is primarily a function  of blade design and performance. Moving a high  volume of air is not necessarily the ultimate goal in fan  performance. Some people prefer a slower cold inflation  to accommodate a thorough preflight inspection.  •   Fuel—gasoline degrades in storage. Do not store  gasoline in the fan due to fire hazard and the formation  of varnish, which can clog fuel passages.  •   Fan maintenance—a good fan requires little maintenance  and should be easy to maintain. Check the oil  periodically and change it once a year. Check hub bolts  and grill screws for tightness on a regular basis.  

# Transport/Chase Vehicle  

Balloon ground transportation varies.  [Figure 2-13]  The most  common vehicles are a van with the balloon carried inside, a  pickup truck with the balloon carried in the bed, or a van or  pickup truck with a small trailer (flatbed or covered). Some  considerations in selecting a transport/chase vehicle are:  

•   Finances—if costs are an issue, a trailer hitch on the  family sedan and a small flatbed trailer may work  just fine.  •   Convenience—for ease of handling the balloon, a small  flatbed trailer low to the ground makes the least lifting  demands on the pilot and crew. One consideration is  that volunteer crew members may have little or no  experience in backing a small trailer.  •   Number of crew members—if the number of crew  members is small, handling the balloon should be  made as easy as possible. If the number of crew  members is large, the size of the chase vehicle and  other factors may be more important.  •   Storage—some balloonists, who do not have room for  inside storage and want security on the road, choose  an enclosed trailer. If an enclosed trailer is used for  storage of the balloon, the trailer should be a light color  to help reduce the heat inside. Keeping the trailer cool  keeps the tank pressure within reasonable limits (so  as not to aggravate a potential fuel leak), and reduces  the vaporization of gasoline in the fan tank (the fumes  

![](images/42fa6611b3c89be8331c0332ba4b4a187abe1de974aa0a5c1e04d578093fa60b.jpg)  
Figure 2-13.   This is an example of a transport vehicle which carries  a small balloon, three adults, a 20-inch inflation fan, and all other  necessary equipment.  

can attack the composition of the balloon’s fabric and  render it unairworthy).  •   Vehicle suitability—terrain, vehicle road clearance,  and number of chase crew members are factors that  determine the suitability of a transport/chase vehicle.  

# Quick/Safety Release  

Safety restraints, referred to as “quick releases” or “safety  tie downs,” are used in balloon inflations. They are designed  to restrain the balloon from movement in breezy or windy  conditions.  

There are several different types of safety restraints available,  but none are part of the aircraft certification process. This  lack of aircraft certification has led to controversy over the  use of safety restraints among ballooning enthusiasts. Since  event participation often requires their use for safety reasons,  the use of safety restraints is now recommended for balloon  launches. Each type of restraint has its own advantages and  disadvantages which a pilot can learn via observation and  discussion with an instructor and/or other balloon pilots.  When a pilot decides to utilize a safety restraint, it is important  to follow the balloon manufacturer’s recommendations on  how to attach it to the balloon superstructure. Many balloons  have been seriously damaged by using an improperly attached  restraint in excessive winds.  

It is also important to insure that all personnel involved with  the inflation, whether pilot, crew or spectator, be aware of  the dangers of a safety restraint. The quick release rates  with the inflation fans as one of the most hazardous pieces  of equipment on the launch field. Early release under load,  or breaking of the safety restraint may cause serious injury.  All personnel involved should be briefed and made aware  of the potential hazards.  

# Miscellaneous Items  

•   Radios—most pilots use some kind of two-way radio  for air to ground communication. There are many  choices available, ranging from Family Radio Service  (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)  radios, which are relatively low cost, to the more  sophisticated FM business band systems, which can  be expensive.    The GMRS and FM radios require licensing by  the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  FRS radios do not. Using cell phones for air-ground  communications is a violation of FCC rules.  •   Igniters—most manufacturers provide at least two  sources of ignition on board. The best igniter is the  simple welding striker. Nearly all balloons have built- in piezo ignition systems.  •   Fueling adapter—adapters are required to connect  the balloon fuel tanks to the propane source. Pilots  should carry their own adapters to ensure the adapters  are clean and not worn. Dirty and worn adapters may  damage a fuel system.  •   Compass—compasses are used to track pibals, check  map orientations, and navigate the balloon. While  almost any good quality compass will do, the best  kind to use is probably the sighting compass.  •   Fire extinguisher—most balloons now come equipped  with small fire extinguishers affixed to the basket. If  one is present, it will be inspected during the annual  inspection. These fire extinguishers are often too small  to extinguish grass fires or serious basket fires caused  by a propane leak. In the case of a propane-leak fire,  turning off a valve usually extinguishes the fire. This  is a better use of pilot time than fumbling for a fire  extinguisher that might not extinguish the fire.  •   First aid kit—the location and contents of first aid kits  vary. Some pilots keep a small first aid kit in their  balloon; some keep one in the chase vehicle. A frequent  topic at Safety Seminars, the contents of the kit often  depend on the area of the country in which the balloon  is flown.  

•   Drop line—drop lines allow ground crew to assist the  pilot in landing in a confined area, or to move the balloon  to an area better suited for deflation and retrieving. A  good drop line has a quick release provision; is easy to  deploy, recover and store; and is easy for a person on  the ground to handle. Webbing is a popular drop line  material because it is strong. Webbing is hard to roll  up, but easy to store. Half-inch nylon braid is strong  and is easily rolled into a ball and put in a bag.  

•   Gloves—pilots and crew members should develop  the habit of wearing gloves anytime they handle the  balloon and associated equipment. A well fitting pair  of gloves can reduce the injuries that occur while  handling balloon equipment, such as rope, cables,  bag handles, etc. In the case of a small fuel leak at  a burner fitting, gloves can minimize a potentially  disastrous situation.  

Gloves should be made of light colored smooth leather  to reflect/deflect propane, and gauntlet style to cover  the wrist. Avoid synthetic material which melts in  heat and ventilated gloves which let in flame or gas.  A second pair of gloves, of appropriate rubberized  material and looser fit, can be used to conduct  refueling operations.  

•   Helmets—balloon manufacturers usually mandate  protective headgear be worn, especially in high wind  conditions to protect heads from impact injury. Store  helmets in a bag that can be carried inside or outside  the basket, depending on number of passengers and  available room.  

•   Spares—the following are recommended spares to carry  in the chase vehicle or to have on hand:  

\*   Local and aeronautical maps \*   Helium tank and pibals (pilot balloons) \*   Quick pins and carabiners \*   Gloves and helmets \*   Envelope fabric and/or patches \*   Refueling adapters \*   Spare tire for the trailer \*   Extra fuel for the fan \*   Extra strikers/igniters  

# Aircraft Documents  

# Airworthiness Certiﬁcate  

An Airworthiness Certificate is issued by a representative  of the FAA after the balloon has been inspected, is found to  meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 31, and is in condition  for safe operation. The Airworthiness Certificate must be  displayed in the aircraft so it is legible to the passengers  and crew whenever it is operated.  [Figure 2-14]  The  Airworthiness Certificate is transferred with the aircraft  except when it is sold to a foreign purchaser.  

A Standard Airworthiness Certificate is issued for aircraft type  certificated in the normal category for manned free balloons.  A Standard Airworthiness Certificate remains in effect as  long as the aircraft receives the required maintenance and is  properly registered in the United States. Flight safety relies,  

![](images/bbc2fa0bdf7061bd35df91b87847a8c971364a2b677575692ea7436009d456c1.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  Standard Airworthiness Certificate.  

in part, on the condition of the aircraft, which is determined  by inspections performed by mechanics, approved repair  stations, or manufacturers who meet specific requirements.  A Special Airworthiness Certificate is issued for all aircraft  certificated in other than the Standard classifications, such  as Experimental or Restricted. When purchasing an aircraft  classified as other than Standard, it is recommended that  the local FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) be  contacted for an explanation of the pertinent airworthiness  requirements and the limitations of such a certificate.  

# Certiﬁcate of Aircraft Registration  

Before an aircraft can be flown legally, it must be registered  with the FAA Civil Aviation Registry. The Certificate of  Aircraft Registration, which is issued to the owner as evidence  of the registration, must be carried in the aircraft at all times.  [Figure 2-15]  The Certificate of Aircraft Registration cannot  be used for operations when:  

•  The aircraft is registered under the laws of a foreign  country. •  The aircraft’s registration is canceled at the written  request of the holder of the certificate. •  The aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped. •  The ownership of the aircraft is transferred. •  The holder of the certificate loses United States  citizenship.  

When one of the events listed in   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   part 47, section  47.41 occurs, the previous owner must notify the FAA by  filling in the back of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration,  and mailing it to:  

Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aviation Registry, AFS-750 P .O. Box 25504 Oklahoma City, OK 73125  

After compliance with 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41, the  pink copy of the application for a Certificate of Aircraft  Registration is authorization to operate an unregistered  aircraft for a period not to exceed 90 days. Since the aircraft  is unregistered, it cannot be operated outside the United  States until a permanent Certificate of Aircraft Registration  is received and placed in the aircraft.  

NOTE: For additional information concerning the Aircraft  Registration Application or the Aircraft Bill of Sale, contact  the nearest FSDO.  

# Aircraft Owner/Operator Responsibilities  

The registered owner/operator of an aircraft is responsible  for certain items, such as: •  Having a current Airworthiness Certificate and a  Certificate of Aircraft Registration in the aircraft.  

![](images/95f0ad3b76bc8d7d70ac877431cdf68335388464e362733276fc7572fab5effd.jpg)  
Figure 2-15.  Certificate of Aircraft Registration.  

•  Maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition,  including compliance with all applicable Airworthiness  Directives. •  Assuring that maintenance is properly recorded. •  Keeping abreast of current regulations concerning the  operation and maintenance of the aircraft. •  Notifying the FAA Civil Aviation Registry immediately  of any change of permanent mailing address, or  the sale or export of the aircraft, or the loss of the  eligibility to register an aircraft. (Refer to   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$    part 47, section 47.41.)  

# Aircraft Maintenance  

Maintenance is defined as the preservation, inspection,  overhaul, and repair of an aircraft, including the replacement  of parts. A properly maintained aircraft is a safe aircraft.  In addition, regular and proper maintenance ensures that  an aircraft meets an acceptable standard of airworthiness  throughout its operational life. Although maintenance  requirements vary for different types of aircraft, experience  shows that aircraft need some type of preventive maintenance  every 25 hours of flying time or less, and minor maintenance  at least every 100 hours. This is influenced by the kind  of operation, climatic conditions, storage facilities, age,  and construction of the aircraft. Manufacturers provide  maintenance manuals, parts catalogs, and other service  information that should be used in maintaining the aircraft.  

# Balloon Inspections  

14 CFR part 91 places primary responsibility on the owner or  operator for maintaining a balloon in an airworthy condition.  Certain inspections must be performed on the balloon, and  the owner must maintain the airworthiness of the balloon  during the time between required inspections by having any  defects corrected. This typically means that fabric damage  outside the maximum allowable damage limits specified by  the manufacturer must be repaired before the envelope can  be deemed airworthy and returned to service.  

# Annual Inspection  

Any balloon flown for business or pleasure and not flown  for compensation or hire is required to be inspected at least  annually. The inspection must be performed by a certificated  and appropriately rated repair station, by the manufacturer, or  by a certificated airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic  who holds an Inspection Authorization (IA). The aircraft  may not be operated unless the annual inspection has been  performed within the preceding 12 calendar months. A period  of 12 calendar months extends from any day of a month to  the last day of the same month the following year.  

# 100-Hour Inspection  

All balloons used to carry passengers for hire must have  received a 100-hour inspection within the preceding 100  hours of time in service and have been approved for return  to service. Additionally, an aircraft used for flight instruction  for hire, when provided by the person giving the flight  instruction, must also have received a 100-hour inspection.  This inspection must be performed by an appropriately rated  FAA certificated repair station, the aircraft manufacturer, or by  an FAA certificated A&P mechanic. An annual inspection, or  an inspection for the issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate,  may be substituted for a required 100-hour inspection.  

# Preflight Inspections  

The preflight inspection is a thorough and systematic means  by which a pilot determines if the aircraft is airworthy  and in condition for safe operation. The balloon’s Flight  Manual contains a section devoted to a systematic method  of performing a preflight inspection. For balloons, this  inspection is usually a part of the layout and inflation process,  and is greatly aided by the use of a checklist. Again, the  pilot must also be aware of maximum damage limitations  as published by the manufacturer.  

# Preventative Maintenance  

Preventive maintenance is considered to be simple or  minor preservation operations and the replacement of small  standard parts, not involving complex assembly operations.  Certificated pilots may perform preventive maintenance on  any balloon that is owned or operated by them. According to  14 CFR part 43, appendix A, preventive maintenance may be  performed by the owner/operator of an aircraft who holds at  least an FAA Private Pilot Certificate with a balloon rating.  

The following is a partial list of preventive maintenance that  may be performed by the owner/operator of a balloon:  

•   Replacing defective safety wiring or cotter keys. •   Lubrication not requiring disassembly. •   The making of small fabric repairs to envelopes  (as defined in, and in accordance with, the balloon  manufacturers’ instructions) not requiring load tape  repair or replacement. •   Refinishing decorative coating of the basket when  removal or disassembly of any primary structure or  operating system is not required. •   Applying preservative or protective material to  components where no disassembly of any primary  structure or operating system is involved and where  such coating is not prohibited or is not contrary to  good practices.  

•   Repairing upholstery and decorative furnishings of  the balloon basket interior when the repairing does  not require disassembly of any primary structure or  operating system or interfere with an operating system  or affect primary structure of the aircraft. •   Replacing seats or seat parts with replacement parts  approved for the aircraft, not involving disassembly  of any primary structure or operating system. •   Replacing prefabricated fuel lines. •   Replacing and servicing batteries. •   Cleaning of balloon burner pilots and main nozzles in  accordance with balloon manufacturers’ instructions. •   Replacement or adjustment of nonstructural standard  fasteners incidental to operations. •   The interchange of balloon baskets and burners on  envelopes when the basket or burner is designated  as interchangeable in the balloon Type Certificate  Data Sheet (TCDS), and the baskets and burners  are specifically designed for quick removal and  installation.  

# Repairs and Alterations  

Repairs and alterations are classified as either major or minor.  14 CFR part 43, appendix A, describes the alterations and  repairs considered major. Major repairs or alterations shall  be approved for return to service on FAA Form 337, Major  Repair and Alteration, by an appropriately rated certificated  repair station, an FAA certificated A&P mechanic holding  an Inspection Authorization, or a representative of the  Administrator. Minor repairs and minor alterations may  be approved for return to service with a proper entry in the  maintenance records by an appropriately certificated repair  station or FAA certificated A&P mechanic.  

For modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the  operating limitations issued to that aircraft. Modifications  in accordance with FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness  Certification of Aircraft and Related Products, may require  the notification of the issuing authority.  

# Airworthiness Directives (ADs)  

A primary safety function of the FAA is to require correction  of unsafe conditions found in an aircraft, aircraft engine,  propeller, or appliance when such conditions exist and are  likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.  The unsafe condition may exist because of a design defect,  maintenance, or other causes. 14 CFR part 39, Airworthiness  Directives (ADs), define the authority and responsibility  of the Administrator for requiring the necessary corrective  action. ADs are the means used to notify aircraft owners and  other interested persons of unsafe conditions and to specify  the conditions under which the product may continue to be  operated. ADs may be divided into two categories:  

1.  Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate  compliance prior to further flight. 2.  Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance  within a specified period of time.  

ADs are regulatory and shall be complied with unless a  specific exemption is granted. It is the aircraft owner or  operator’s responsibility to ensure compliance with all  pertinent ADs. 14 CFR part 91, section 91.417 requires  a record to be maintained that shows the current status of  applicable ADs, including the method of compliance; the AD  number and revision date, if recurring; the time and date when  due again; the signature; kind of certificate; and certificate  number of the repair station or mechanic who performed  the work. For ready reference, many aircraft owners have a  chronological listing of the pertinent ADs in the back of their  aircraft maintenance records.  

# Choosing a Balloon  

Many companies manufacture balloons that are type- certificated by the FAA. A type-certificated balloon has passed  many tests, has been approved by the FAA, and conforms to  the manufacturer’s TCDS. Balloon size is rated by envelope  volume with categories defined in metric units.  Figure 2-16   illustrates the most popular size ranges in use today (volumes  are provided in cubic meters, as well as cubic feet).  

![Figure 2-16.  Popular balloon size ranges. ](images/ec35c2b7fc7089f7efcf29fefac769b488cd0ba229cab301e1a1f76ffef5c8bd.jpg)  

# Advantages of Balloon Sizes  

Different balloon sizes offer different advantages. The size  of the balloon purchased should be determined according to  planned use(s). Most pilots think smaller balloons are easier to  handle, fly, and pack up. Bigger balloons use less fuel, operate  cooler, and last longer. Higher elevations or hotter climates or  passengers indicate a larger balloon. Balloon competitions and  sport flying require a smaller balloon.  [Figure 2-17]  

![](images/85e719e66e80586754d21ea5bf8add6c5e058904ca60c5475f5d211a724e8019.jpg)  
Figure 2-17.  Comparison of balloon sizes.  

# Selecting a New or Used Balloon  

The cost is the most obvious difference between new and  used balloons. Some new pilots buy a used balloon to gain  proficiency, and then purchase a new balloon when they have  a better idea of what they want or need.  

Prior to purchasing any used balloon, it is important to  ensure that the balloon is airworthy, to avoid purchasing an  aircraft which may be nearing, or perhaps past, its useful life.  Most balloon envelopes are constructed of fabrics that last  well into the 300–400 hour range, with some newer fabrics  exceeding that life span. It would be prudent to have the  balloon inspected by a reputable repair station or qualified  inspector prior to purchase.  

# Balloon Brands  

The level of after sales service available—locally and from  the manufacturer—is an important criterion in deciding which  brand of balloon to purchase. Talk to local pilots and ask  questions. How does the local balloon repair station feel about  different brands? Do they stock parts for only one brand?  Does the manufacturer ship parts and fabric for balloons  already in the field, or do they reserve these parts and fabric  for new production? Do they ground older model balloons  for lack of materials while new balloons are being built?  

There are other criteria that could be considered, such as  altitude at which the balloon will be flying, climate, and  interchange ability of components, to give some examples.  Before making the final decision, talk to people with different  kinds of balloons who do different kinds of flying. Crewing  for different balloons is an excellent way to learn about  balloons and can help in the decision on what first balloon  to purchase.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter gives the reader common terminology for use  in the ballooning community.  Many times, confusion exists  between the student pilot and the instructor, due to differences  in terminology used, and it is hoped that the discussions  here resolve those issues.  The reader also should have an  understanding of the physics of hot-air ballooning, as well  as a good understanding of the support equipment involved  with ballooning activities.  

Propane information has also been included in this chapter,  and it is recommended that all pilots review this on a recurring  basis, perhaps as part of a yearly safety seminar.  Additionally,  proper documentation, and inspection requirements have  been covered. Each pilot should become knowledgeable in  these areas.  

# Preﬂight Planning  

Flight planning starts long in advance of the few hours before  the launch. Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 91, section 91.103 states: “Each pilot in command (PIC)  shall, before beginning a flight, become familiar with all available  information concerning that flight…(to include) weather reports  and forecasts, fuel requirements…(and) other reliable information  appropriate to the aircraft, relating to aircraft performance under  expected values of airport elevation,…aircraft gross weight, and  wind and temperature.”  

The practical test standards (PTS), for both Private and  Commercial certificates, indicate a number of items that must  be considered, evaluated, and planned in the execution of a  safe flight. Some of these items are the use and interpretation  of weather data to plan a flight, the use and interpretation of  aeronautical charts and local area maps, and performance and  limitation of the balloon.  

Weather Theory and Reports will be covered in some detail  in Chapter 4 and The National Airspace System (NAS) will  be reviewed in Chapter 5. The following discussions assume  familiarity with both subjects, and will introduce a number  of other new subjects.  

# Purpose of Flight  

Preflight planning will vary according to the flight’s  purpose. For example, if a training flight is planned, more  detailed attention to map work and performance planning  may be appropriate. If a passenger-carrying flight is being  undertaken, a meeting point for the passengers and crew  will need to be designated, and refreshments will need to be  planned. If the flight is to participate in an organized rally,  particular attention must be paid to weather trends and wind  plotting, to ensure the pilot is able to reach the intended target  and score points. These type of considerations are part of the  initial balloon preflight planning process.  

# Weather  

A good balloon pilot studies the weather several days before  the day of the flight in order to understand the weather trends,  cycles, and the correlation of weather report information with  the actual weather in a particular flying area. Most, if not  all, weather reporting information is computed for a large  regional area, whereas balloon flying is generally conducted  in an area about 15 square miles. When a balloon pilot makes  the correlation between the weather outlooks and forecasts,  and how that will impact winds and environment in the local  flying area, he or she is well on the way to understanding  the effects of weather on preflight planning, as well as the  balloon flight.  

Particular attention should be paid to the location and  movement of pressure systems and the jet stream, frontal  activity, temperatures in front of and behind frontal zones,  and winds. As the proposed flight date draws closer, a  reasonable prediction of possible weather can be forecast, but  a pilot must remember that a weather forecast more than 72  hours prior to a flight is not an absolute. It is also worthwhile  to watch local and nationally televised weather broadcasts to  gain insights on the weather systems that may be affecting  the desired flying area at the time of the flight.  

Unofficial sources of weather information can also prove  helpful for obtaining weather information about a particular  area. It is beneficial to contact balloon pilots who fly in the  area of intended flight to learn of nuances in the weather  patterns, especially during initial training or when flying in  a new area. Another source of information for weather is  pilots who fly other types of aircraft in the proposed flight  area. They can be located through the local airport’s fixed  base operator (FBO). People who make their living outside,  particularly farmers, have a unique perspective on local  weather. They often offer weather information on local  weather that is unavailable through a commercial source.  

When possible, it is valuable for a balloon pilot to  visit the local National Weather Service (NWS) office.  [Figure 3-1]  NWS provides information and sources for a  number of weather products, which must be considered in  the weather planning process. A visit to the NWS office also  gives a balloonist the opportunity to talk with the individuals  who provide the weather information used in the briefings.  NWS can provide the balloonist with a clear explanation  of what products and information are required to make an  intelligent flight decision.

The night before a flight is anticipated (or in the morning, in  the event of an afternoon flight), a call should be made to the  Flight Service Station (FSS) for an outlook briefing. These  are generally available 6 hours or more before a specific  flight period. (There are three different types of briefings  available: standard, abbreviated, and outlook. They will be  discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, Weather Theory and  Reports). This briefing information is used to make tentative  decisions regarding the flight, such as go/no-go, and potential  directions of travel. Additionally, a pilot should pay particular  attention to local and regional forecasts in the media, as they  may provide information specific to the area of flight.  

Prior to flight, a standard briefing should be obtained  from the FSS. This briefing will contain the most recent  weather information and data, and will serve either to verify  information obtained through other sources, or validate the  possibility of a go/no-go decision. It is also helpful to check  one or more automated weather reporting sites, such as the  Automatic T erminal Information Service (ATIS) or Automatic  Weather Observing System (AWOS) that are close to the  intended flying area. ATIS and AWOS provide the advantage  of a real-time, immediate information source. They may  be contacted by telephone, or often monitored by aviation  radio. Phone numbers for the ATIS and AWOS systems may  be found in the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD). Radio  frequencies for the ATIS and AWOS are shown on aviation  sectional charts.  

Gathering weather information en route to the launch site  can be done by searching for indications of current winds.  For example, observe how the leaves on a tree move, track  the smoke from a factory smokestack, or notice the direction  a flag blows. All of these signs give good indications of the  current winds, both on the ground and at low altitude. Once  at the launch site, or possible launch site, most experienced  pilots inflate and release a pibal (pilot balloon) to assess on  site wind speeds and direction.  [Figure 3-2]  

![](images/3ce4c6d678f1af4d3da7440189bd438e2dbec56084fc3db31b04586bf1a58a62.jpg)  
Figure 3-2.   Preparing to release a pibal.  

Many pilots develop historical data on weather conditions in  their home flying areas. When shared with the beginning pilot,  this weather data provides a wealth of information on trends  and cycles. The comparison of individual predictions with  actual weather experienced offers understanding and insight  into micro-area weather conditions. Comparison of weather  reports from nearby weather reporting stations with the actual  weather experienced is also be an excellent learning tool. This  exercise provides insight into the weather patterns common in  a particular flying area. See Appendix A for a sample weather  briefing checklist that may be used as a guide to develop  personal forms for recording weather briefings.  

There are numerous sources of weather information available  on the Internet. These include but are not limited to web sites  operated by the NWS (www.nws.noaa.gov), Intellicast (www. intellicast.com), and Unisys (www.weather.unisys.com). Web  sites devoted to weather and ballooning include but are not  limited to Blastvalve.com (www.blastvalve.com/weather), US  Airnet.com (www.usairnet.com), and the Balloon Federation  of America (BFA) at www.bfa.net. Ballooning enthusiast  Ryan Carlton has developed a wind forecasting site that is  located at ryancarlton.com/wind.php. All of these sites provide  resources and reference information on weather.  

It should be remembered that none of these web sites provide  an official weather briefing. It is necessary to call the FSS,  or use an on-line briefing service such as Direct User Access  Terminal System (DUATS) to receive an official briefing.  Failure to receive a proper briefing may create a liability issue  for a pilot in the event of an incident or accident.  

# Some weather related tips are:  

•  Forecasts are a good place to start, but are not the  end of weather planning. Unforecast events happen  continuously. Proficiency in understanding small area  weather is necessary, and can only be developed with  practice and experience.  •  Balloons generally fly early in the morning, within  the first two hours after sunrise, to avoid unstable  conditions, which may prove to be hazardous to  balloon flights and operations. It may be possible  to fly in the late afternoon, within an hour or two of  sunset, when thermal effects are calming down and  winds are usually decreasing.  •  Almost all balloon flying is done in relatively benign  weather conditions and mild winds. Most pilots prefer  to launch and fly in winds less than 7 knots. While  balloon flying is performed in higher winds, pilots  accept that the faster the winds, the more they are  exposed to risk and injury. Balloon flight manuals list  the maximum launch winds for a particular balloon;  this information, as well as personal limitations, are  considerations for any pilot. •  Balloons do not fly in significant (or unstable) weather.  A balloon should not be launched in the face of a squall  line, or during a tornado warning or watch.  •  Flying in precipitation is a bad practice. Rainwater  (or any frozen precipitation) on the balloon causes it  

to get wet and become heavier, often to the point of  being unable to maintain altitude without exceeding  temperature limitations of the envelope. A wet  envelope heated to flight temperatures can be seriously  damaged because the heat often causes fabric coatings  and treatments to degrade, decreasing the life of the  fabric. If a balloon gets wet, it should never be dried out  by the application of heat to the point of equilibrium,  or neutral buoyancy.  

•  Precipitation also often causes the atmosphere to  become increasingly unstable. Downdrafts, wind  gusts, and the possibility of hail and lightning follow.  The pilot may be the last one to know that it is raining  because the balloon will shield him or her from the  precipitation. Ground crew can detect the slightest  trace of precipitation before a pilot does, and need  to communicate this information immediately to the  pilot. In the face of possible precipitation, cancellation  of the flight is the best plan.  

# Navigation  

Navigation of a balloon is unlike that of any other aircraft  because it cannot be steered in the conventional sense.  Directional control is achieved through the use of differing  wind directions at different altitudes. With effort, study, and  some practice, it is possible for a balloon pilot to determine  a point on the ground at some distance, and fly to it with  relative ease and accuracy.  

The first step in learning balloon navigation is understanding  the maps used in balloon flight. Two types of maps are  used: sectional aeronautical charts and local topographical  maps. Both have their uses and each has advantages and  disadvantages. Another type of map may be available to  the balloon pilot. This is a local area map developed by  the local balloon club which shows prohibited zones and  sensitive areas.  

Sectional aeronautical charts (or sectionals) are published on  a routine basis by the National Aeronautical Charting Office 

 (NACO), a division of the Federal Aviation Administration 

 (FAA).  [Figure 3-3]  These charts are at a scale of 1:500,000 

 (one inch representing 500,000 inches on the ground, or  about 7.9 miles), are similar to an automobile road map,  and provide useful information to a balloon pilot flying  under visual flight rules (VFR). Charts are generally named  for the most prominent city contained within the area of the  sectional chart.  

There are also sectional charts with a smaller scale,  1:250,000, to represent the areas immediately surrounding  Class B airspace, which is the airspace surrounding major air  traffic facilities in the United States. Airspace is discussed  in detail in Chapter 5, The National Airspace System. These  charts (commonly referred to as terminal area charts) show a  significantly increased level of detail, and, if available, may  be of more value than a standard sectional.  

![](images/c016cb22ec85ace3758e0dc744471c79723e4724da27018eae97a82bd06bc350.jpg)  
Figure 3-3.   Sectional chart depicting the Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Class B airspace.  

Sectionals depict many different things, including controlled  and uncontrolled airspace, airports, major roads and highways,  cities and small towns, etc. They also indicate obstacles to  flight, such as major transmission lines, radio, TV , and water  towers, smokestacks, and other items. The legend of the  sectional provides a means to identify these landmarks. A  more detailed explanation of sectionals and the information  they contain, is found in the FAA Aeronautical Chart User’s  Guide, a publication of the NACO. This publication may be  found at many pilot supply stores where sectionals are sold,  or may be purchased online, along with the maps themselves,  at www.naco.faa.gov.  

Pilots review the sectional chart and familiarize themselves  with the airspace they may be using when flying in a new  area or refreshing their memory of a frequently flown area.  The sectional helps a pilot determine obstacles to flight  (towers, powerlines, etc), as well as locating landmarks for  use during the flight. While sectionals offer much valuable  information on an area, their lack of resolution on a small  scale means they do not provide enough information for a  balloon flight. The length of the average balloon flight is  6 to 8 miles. On the sectional, this equates to the distance  between the first joint and tip of one’s thumb. This lack of  significant detail is a disadvantage for navigation in a balloon,  but sectionals are useful as a source of general information  about a given area.  

A good topographic chart, such as the commercially available  United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps offer more  value to the balloon pilot. These maps depict information on  a relatively small scale and are more useful to the balloon  pilot. They show individual terrain features such as roads  and road networks, built up areas, schools and churches,  and will indicate wooded areas, as well as open pastureland.  [Figure 3-4]  

With any map, it is important to insure the map is current and  has an accurate depiction of north. To check the orientation  of a map, select one particular road or feature with a specific  directional orientation. Then orient the map to that feature,  matching the direction of the road with the map. Place a  compass (preferably a sighting compass) on the map to  determine the azimuth. Use the same compass that will be  used for computing the flight path. Ensure that nothing is  affecting the compass reading. It is important to distinguish  “true north,” used by most cartographers, and “magnetic  north,” as indicated on the compass. Once the azimuth is  established, sketch a compass rose, or place a “stick-on” type  compass rose on the map.  

Once the map is oriented and aligned to north, fill in other  information as necessary as reminders. For example, airspace  

![](images/1d0c029eefbf7187041bb1abdb53d4d072713437783e85a294e80e1472506b28.jpg)

that may preclude balloon operations, local no-fly areas, or  areas with potential landowner relations problems should be  marked. If the pilot is flying competitively, he or she may elect  to mark designated “targets” on the map for ease in identifying  them at a later time.  

Perhaps the most underutilized use of maps is predicting  likely flight paths, landmarks, and potential landing sites.  Using the simple technique outlined below, this field  technique allows pilots accurate real time and on-site weather  data for flight planning information. A pilot needs to know  where he or she is going in order to plan how to get there.  This is a necessary part of flight planning, and learning the  basic skills and knowledge required to plot this information  improves the flight experience.  

Pat Cannon, a former BFA National Champion and  competitive pilot, developed a technique derived from a NWS  procedure (that was later modified) to plot the information  obtained from a pibal reading. This procedure requires a  pencil, large square graph paper, an aviation plotter, pibals,  the compass used to calibrate the map, and a watch with a  sweep second hand. Two assumptions are made with this  procedure. First, most pibals rise at an average rate of 300  feet per minute (fpm). (A chart of pibal climb rates can be  found in Appendix B.) Therefore, after 30 seconds, a pibal  will be approximately 150 feet above ground level (AGL).  

Second, for the purposes of this exercise, the winds do not  have any significant speed changes.  

Prior to starting the plot, a scale depicting the wind speed  must be established. In this example illustrated, two squares  on the graph paper will represent a wind speed of 5 miles per  hour (mph). In the absence of a wind meter, or other accurate  wind reading, a rough estimate of the wind speed may be  made using the technique shown in  Figure 3-5 .  

![](images/f9800f89282b24eb6dada2040af902b1d5cc5f7b9af471077a8186ee4da21533.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.  A  method for determining wind speed.  

To begin plotting the pibal recording information, release the  pibal and track it with the compass. After 30 seconds, take  a reading and make a mark on the graph paper to represent  the start point. Make a second mark to represent the direction  plotted. In  Figure 3-6,  a track of   $300^{\circ}$   at 5 mph is depicted.  Label the first two points “ A ” and “B.”  [Figure 3-6]  

At 1 minute, take a second reading. The pibal will be at  approximately 300 feet AGL. In this example, the reading  taken is   $310^{\circ}$  . Using the plotter, draw a line   $10^{\circ}$   off the  original azimuth (the A-B line), and make another mark  approximately two squares away from the mark labeled  “B.” For clarity, this is be labeled “C”. See the example in  Figure 3-7.  (NOTE: The angles in the successive graphics  are exaggerated for clarity.)  

![](images/55cc782a0616ab2367fa90705aa15b8dc924532aeec55f63337fb1573e6c25d1.jpg)  
Figure 3-7.  Second pibal plot showing  $310^{\circ}$   at 1 minute.  

At 1:30 minutes, take another reading. The pibal will be at  approximately 450 feet. Using the plotter, draw a line  $30^{\circ}$   off  the original azimuth (the A-B line), and make another mark  approximately two squares away from the mark labeled “C.”  This mark may be labeled “D” for clarity.  [Figure 3-8]  

![](images/e9302f9212b8b32a64f469f93587ddb44e5b7cc6ddcbf02f6a82e7c400da004a.jpg)  
Figure 3-8.  Third pibal plot showing  $330^{\circ}$   at 1:30 minutes.  

Although plotting can be continued as long as the pibal remains in  sight, only the three points marked will be used for this exercise.  Figure 3-9  illustrates the results of the above sequence.  

![](images/211fb87c5671ec9953bbe1732c2522fc5f3343fda6e05f582c01a80e9223985f.jpg)  
Figure 3-9.   A line drawn through the last two plots provides a basis  to measure the angle and determine the wind at that altitude. In  this case, it is 450 feet.  

T o determine the wind directions at different altitudes, extend  lines between the plotted points as shown in  Figure 3-9  back  through the initial azimuth. Using the plotter, measure the  angle between the lines (the angle between the A-B line  and the C-D line). That angle, added to the original azimuth  heading, gives a good approximation of the winds at that  altitude. For the example shown in this sequence, the true  track at 450 feet AGL is  $005^{\circ}$  . A grid appropriate for this  computation is located in Appendix B.  

This exercise demonstrates a practical method for determining  approximate wind directions using items readily available  to most pilots. It does not require expensive handheld  calculators, laptop computers, or a theolodite that costs  thousands of dollars. There is some error inherent in this  process that can be lessened with experience and practice,  but the readings obtained by this method can offer real  time, on site weather data no forecast or briefer can provide.  [Figures 3-10  and  3-11]  

The information on basic surface winds and winds aloft  readings gathered by this method can be used by a pilot  to project a flight path and anticipated landing sites with  a sectional or topographic map. This plot will form a “V ,”  with the cone beginning at the launch site. The two legs will  represent the extremes of the plotted measurements. The  difference between these two extremes is called steerage.  Flying higher will track the flight path closer to the winds  

aloft reading, while contour flying will put the balloon closer  to the ground track leg. Varying altitude will allow the pilot  to fly down the middle of the “v.” Accuracy will depend  on the consistency of the conditions, but flight paths and  landing sites may be predicted, after practice, with a high  degree of reliability.  

The balloon pilot, more than pilots who fly other types of  aircraft, must have the capability of visualizing the winds  aloft in three dimensions. Continued spatial awareness  (how the balloon is moving through the air), is important  for maintaining control of the balloon and navigating to the  desired point on the ground. Every other safety measure  taken is compromised by inflating a balloon and taking off  without proper planning and an understanding of the winds  and terrain to be navigated.  [Figure 3-12]  

![](images/3239658999f376b17ed8cfc4ebc1041945bd47d08dfd518ebd4b37b2fa0aef09.jpg)  
Figure 3-12.   As the balloon ascends, the flightpath inclines to the  right. Correlate this visualization to a map to determine the ground  track of the balloon during flight.  

# Performance Planning  

Prior to a discussion of performance planning, a number of  terms must be defined.  

Maximum Allowable Gross Weight is that maximum amount  of weight that the balloon may lift, under standard conditions.  This figure is usually stipulated in design criteria, and  addressed in the Type Certificate Data Sheet pertaining to that  balloon. It can also be found on the weight and balance page  of the flight manual for that particular balloon. An average of  1,000 cubic feet of air, when heated, will lift 20 pounds.  

Useful lift (load) in aviation is the potential weight of the pilot,  passengers, equipment, and fuel. It is the basic empty weight  of the aircraft (found in the flight manual for each balloon)  subtracted from the maximum allowable gross weight. This  term is frequently confused with payload, which in aviation is  defined as the weight of occupants, cargo, and baggage.  

Density altitude is defined in the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25) as “pressure  altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature.” Density  altitude is determined by first finding pressure altitude, and  then correcting this altitude for nonstandard temperature  variations. For example, when set at 29.92, the altimeter may  indicate a pressure altitude of 5,000 feet. Under standard  temperature conditions   $(59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  , this may allow for a useful  load of 1,050 pounds. However, if the temperature is   $20^{\circ}$    above standard, the expansion of the air raises the density  altitude level (the air is less dense, thereby mimicking the  density of the air at a higher altitude). Using temperature  correction data from tables or graphs, it may be found that  the density level is above 8,000 feet, and the useful load is  then reduced to 755 pounds. This definition, however, has a  tendency to confuse many new (and some not-so-new) pilots,  so a more thorough explanation is justified.  

The AIM explains density altitude as being nothing more  than a way to comparatively measure aircraft performance.  Paragraph 7-5-6 states, in part, “Density altitude is a measure  of air density. It is not to be confused with pressure altitude,  true altitude or absolute altitude. It is not to be used as a height  reference, but as a determining criteria [sic] in the performance  capability of an aircraft.” With respect to ballooning, this is a  more useful definition of the term.  

How does density altitude affect balloon performance?  Density altitude affects balloon performance in two ways.  First and more important, as a balloon gains altitude, it loses  capacity, insofar as its lifting capability is concerned. This  means a balloon capable of lifting 1,400 pounds at sea level  may only be able to lift 1,150 pounds or less at 4,000 feet. For  a pilot who seldom leaves the local area, this rarely causes a  problem. For the pilot who travels from the low area of the  Southeast to fly in the mile-high altitudes of Albuquerque,  

New Mexico, the changes in balloon capability and decrease  in burner performance are important considerations while  planning for the flight.  

Second, heater performance is degraded at a rate of 4  percent per 1,000 feet of altitude. This means on a standard  reference day, a particular heater will have lost 12 percent of  its efficiency at 3,000 feet, or be performing at 88 percent of  its capability. This is due to the loss of the partial pressure of  oxygen, a necessary component of combustion.  

Preflight planning requires consideration of balloon loading  and performance with respect to altitude and expected  temperatures. Balloon manufacturers have provided the  information necessary to determine these factors in the  form of a performance chart in the flight manual. Referred  to as nomographs or nomograms, performance charts are  simple to use and provide excellent planning information.  [Figure 3-13]  

If three of the above factors are known, a fourth may be  determined. The performance charts may be used in many  ways to determine performance of the balloon on a given day.  This process does not have to be computed at the beginning of  each flight. Many pilots develop a listing of possible weights,  temperatures, and altitudes, depending on the average flying  conditions for their home area. This is an acceptable practice  

![](images/db1aa684a9c23441c9cb0273b8b7d4d0c1f6bf6ca5700a60e8cb58ffc24036ba.jpg)  
Figure 3-13.    Typical performance chart for a 77,000 cubic foot balloon.  

as long as the information is available and consulted when  appropriate.  

Using the chart in  Figure 3-13 , determine the maximum  gross lift that may be expected on a  $60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   day, with decisions  not to exceed   $190~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   envelope temperature and 1,500 feet  pressure altitude. In this example, the established parameters  equate what many pilots consider when doing performance  planning. They decide they do not want to exceed a given  altitude or envelope temperature.) T o determine the maximum  gross lift available, the nomograph should be entered at point  A, at the ambient temperature of   $60\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   Move right, to the  line indicating an envelope temperature of  $190\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   (point B).  Then, move down vertically to a point equidistant between  the lines denoting altitude of 1,000 and 2,000 feet (point C).  Then, move horizontally to the left to the gross lift axis of  the chart and read the result (point D). In the illustrated  example, this computation results in a maximum gross lift  of 1,120 pounds.  

Using the chart again in  Figure 3-13 , determine the maximum  altitude to which the balloon may climb, given the same  maximum gross lift figure of 1,150 pounds. In this example,  it is simply a matter of extending the lines appropriately. The  A-B line would be extended to the diagonal line indicating  a maximum temperature of  $250~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   (which is the maximum  continuous operating temperature for most balloons). Then,  a perpendicular line would be drawn from that intersection  point. After that line is drawn, extend the C-D line to the  right, and the intersection of those two lines will indicate the  maximum altitude. In this example, this computation results  in a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet.  

# Special Conditions  

Most balloon flying is done in non-hostile terrain and benign  weather. There are, some instances in which the terrain may  be more difficult, both for the pilot and the chase crew, and the  weather may become a significant factor. With proper preflight  planning, the problems inherent in mountain flying and cold  weather flying can be resolved. While somewhat riskier than  normal flying, this type of flying can be safely conducted.  

# Cold Weather Flying  

Some pilots prefer flying in cold weather, which offers the  advantages of more stable air and less fuel consumption to  maintain flight. This means long, gentle flights for the pilot.  There are two main disadvantages to cold weather flying:  the need to maintain adequate pressure in the balloon’s fuel  system and the difficulty of keeping the pilot, crew, and  passengers warm.  

As propane gets colder, it has less vapor pressure. (See chart of  propane and butane partial pressures, Appendix C). T o ensure  adequate pressure in cold weather, follow the manufacturer’s  recommended method, which will be described in the flight  manual. Many manufacturers recommend the use of nitrogen,  an inert gas that may be added to the fuel tanks by means of a  regulator. This is perhaps the easiest way to pressurize tanks,  as it may be done on site, and with little or no prior planning.  It does require the use of a nitrogen tank and a two-stage  regulator. These items must be available to the pilot before  the flight. If the flight is cancelled after pressurization, and  the anticipated rise in temperature is expected to be more than   $30^{\circ}$  , the pressure will need to be bled off by using the fixed  liquid level gauge.  

Balloon systems using a vapor feed pilot system may not  be able to use nitrogen as it can result in an unreliable pilot  light. Those systems commonly use heat tapes or heated tank  covers in order to warm the propane. Heat tapes, similar to  those used to prevent water pipes from freezing, are reliable.  They do require frequent inspection, as normal wear and  tear may cause an electrical short, with potential danger of  damage to the fuel tanks. Among the aftermarket types of heat  tapes, the ones with an internal thermostat will cycle once a  particular temperature is reached, reducing the possibility of  overheating the tanks.  

Use tank heaters and heat tapes with extra caution. Tanks must  not be heated in an area within 50 feet of an open flame, near  an appliance with a pilot light, or in a closed area without  natural ventilation.  

Pilots, as well as crew, should be dressed appropriately  for the environment. Layered clothing that entraps warm  air is standard cold weather gear. Note that cold weather  environments commonly promote static electricity. It is  important that clothing of natural fibers be used, rather  than synthetics. A hat is important, as significant body heat  escapes from the head. Warm gloves and footwear are a must.  Remember that certain types of hypoxia, or lack of oxygen  to the brain (discussed in Chapter 9, Aeromedical Factors),  may be aggravated by exposure to continued cold. Pilots and  crew should be aware of the symptoms of hypothermia and  frostbite, guard against them, and have a plan in place to deal  with potential medical emergencies.  

From an equipment standpoint, the balloon requires no special  preparation, other than insuring proper pressure in the fuel  system. Pilots should be aware that seals and O-rings may  shrink somewhat or become brittle in cold weather. This may  cause a propane leak, and special caution should be taken  during the equipment preflight process to ensure that this  will not be an issue. The pilot and chase crew should also be  careful not to pack snow in the envelope, particularly if the  balloon will be stored for a long period of time before the  next flight. With respect to the chase vehicle, remember to  have antifreeze in the cooling system. It is advisable to carry  chains, a shovel, and a windshield wiper/scraper if there is a  possibility of snow.  

# Mountain Flying  

Flying in mountainous terrain can provide one of the most  exhilarating flights imaginable, but there are numerous  planning factors that must be considered.  [Figure 3-14]  

![](images/1cc4932068ad6feabc24aa0af42eddbb85bd0d3e1d7bf48ca1052616b81e1664.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.  Mountain flying.  

Weather, with its associated phenomena, is perhaps the most  important to understand of the many factors involved in  mountain flying. When inflating a balloon, drainage winds  (a form of orographic wind) may cause the envelope to move  from its planned position, and may even roll back over the  basket, pilot, and crew. As most weather forecasts do not  address this issue, consult with local pilots regarding these  wind’s formation, strength, and onset. In flight, winds flowing  across mountain terrain set up features, such as rotors and  standing waves (discussed in Chapter 4, Weather) which may  cause a complete loss of control of the balloon. Other less  violent winds may cause the balloon to proceed in unplanned  directions, and require adjustments to landing and retrieval  plans. It is important that any pilot contemplating flight in  mountainous terrain be aware of these potential conditions,  and plan to minimize their effects.  

Communications in mountainous terrain can be a significant  factor because most radios used by balloonists are line of  sight, and will not work well, if at all, in particularly hilly or  mountainous terrain. Cell phones may be used after landing,  but again may be limited by the lack of cell towers and general  reception problems. A good communications plan between  pilot and ground crew includes a “lost balloon” contact with  a common phone number that both parties call in order to find  where the other is. This could possibly be a person at home,  willing to relay the information as necessary, or perhaps an  answering machine from which both the pilot and crew may  retrieve messages.  

Mountain flying that involves long distances requires  appropriate clothing. Refer to the earlier paragraph on dressing  for cold weather flying, which also applies to mountain  flying. Good preflight planning will ensure that the pilot  and passengers are prepared for a cold weather flight. It also  prepares for the possibility of remaining out in the cold while  the ground crew locates the balloon, since following a balloon  can be difficult in mountainous terrain. Some pilots carry  additional equipment in the balloon that they do not carry  on flatland flights. Suggested provisions and equipment are  water, additional warm clothing or a sleeping bag, a strobe,  a radio, a compass, a lightweight shelter (a Mylar ®  sheet can  be made into a simple tent, for example), and a good map or  maps of the area.  

# The Ground Crew  

As ground crew have no legal status or authority within  14 CFR, it is easy to overlook or downplay their role in  the preflight process, as well as flight safety. Ground crew  knowledge and skill bring both the brains and brawn necessary  at every stage of a flight—from equipment set-up and flight  path plotting to taking inflight wind readings and assisting  challenging landings. Without sufficient crew, a pilot becomes  rushed, distracted, uninformed, or in the midst of hazardous  conditions. Ground crews serve not only as physical help and  assistance, but also serve as a form of redundancy for a pilot’s  eyes, muscles, and mind.  [Figure 3-15]  

While crew requirements may vary from flight to flight,  consider the following during the preflight process:  

•  Two crew members to assist is a good starting point.  During the chase phase, one may drive while the other  navigates; two may handle emergencies better than  one. Words of caution: more is not always better. In  some cases, passengers on board the balloon may be  able and willing to help pack and unpack equipment.  Another factor may be the capacity of the chase  vehicle.

Figure 3-15.  Equipment set-up with a ground crew.  

•  At least one crew member should be familiar with  the balloon, the pilot’s flight planning and routines,  emergency procedures, vehicle operations (liftgate  operations, trailer backing, etc.) and the local area. If  out of town, a local person who knows the area and  roads can prove to be invaluable. •  A crew chief should be designated early in the preflight  planning process to avoid conflicts or communications  breakdowns later. This person oversees all ground  operations, under the direction of the pilot, directs  other crew members, and speaks on behalf of the pilot  when meeting landowners. •  The crew should be free of major disabilities  (pre-existing back conditions, severe allergies/ respiratory conditions), capable of lifting/moving  heavy equipment, and in good physical shape. •  A meeting place should be designated well in advance  of the launch time. It is prudent to err on the early  side, as being late causes all other facets of the flight  process to be rushed, increasing the potential for risks.  If the meeting site is to serve also as the launch site,  there should be a secondary location available in case  of relocation. •  Crew members who are healthy, rested, and focused  perform best. Minimize conditions or distractions that  compromise these items.  

While most crew members participate in ballooning for the  fun and friendship it offers, it is essential they are committed  to their ongoing role in flight safety. Preflight planning  requires that a pilot consider how crew will help each flight  unfold safely.  

# Flying in New Territory  

When planning a flight in a new or unfamiliar area, it is  important to insure that balloonists are welcome. If possible,  talk to local balloonists who may be familiar with the area,  and who may be able to point out local no-fly areas, potential  launch and landing sites, and potential landowner problem  areas. T o locate local balloonists:  

•  Call the nearest Flight Standards District Office  (FSDO) and ask for the name of a balloon pilot  examiner or FAA Safety team member. •  Look in the local telephone book under “Balloons— Manned.” •  Check for local balloon clubs in the area. •  Check the BFA membership roster online at www.bfa. net.  

If there are no balloonists in the local area, talk to other aircraft  pilots or local law enforcement offices. Let them know that a  balloon flight is being planned and ask for advice.  

# Equipment  

Pack all equipment; have it ready and double checked the  night before a flight. New pilots should create and follow a  checklist that covers all of the home station preparations for the  chase vehicle and equipment. Simple tasks, such as ensuring  that radios and cell phones are properly charged, can easily  be overlooked. Check to see that the balloon, fan, and vehicle  are fueled; vehicle tires are inflated; required documentation  is in the balloon; and all necessary maps, radios, and other  equipment are loaded in the chase vehicle.  [Figure 3-16]  

![](images/7c5bd4f989a83078981be8ca708158e1459bde51f167a03ee40c8046f8c6fc0d.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.   It is important to check that all equipment is in proper  working condition prior to flight.  

# Personal Preparation  

The most important single element in preflight preparation is  the pilot. A pilot anticipating a flight should do a quick self- analysis to ensure that he or she is mentally and physically  capable and competent to perform. It is not uncommon to see  pilots and crews drive all night to get to an event, and, without  sleep or perhaps suffering from a cold or other ailment, go  ahead and fly. Allow enough time and resources to remain  healthy, rested, and focused enough to make wise flight  preparations and decisions that maximize flight safety.  

It is a good policy to do an individual “preflight,” using the  “I’M SAFE” evaluation checklist as illustrated in Chapter 1,  Introduction to Balloon Flight Training,  Figure 1-5 .  

# Chapter Summary  

Flying a hot air balloon requires extensive preflight planning  which depends upon a knowledge of meteorology applied to  local weather conditions, the ability to navigate using charts  and maps, familiarity with the equipment used in ballooning, a  good support ground crew, and a dash of common sense. Safe  flight experiences for a pilot in ballooning or any other aircraft  depend upon continuing education and experience.  

# Chapter 4 Weather Theory and Reports  

# Introduction  

Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time  and place, with respect to temperature, moisture content,  turbulence, and cloudiness. These factors interact to form  the following five major meteorological elements:  

•  Atmospheric pressure (high or low), •  Air temperature (heat or cold), •  Wind (calm or storm), •  Clouds (clearness or cloudiness), and •  Precipitation (rain, sleet, snow).  

A solid understanding of weather theory provides the tools  necessary to understand the reports and forecasts obtained  from a Flight Service Station (FSS) weather specialist and  other aviation weather services. No other means of aviation  relies more heavily on knowledge and understanding of  weather for its safety than ballooning. It is important to note,  however, that there is no substitute for experience.  

There are many excellent texts and online sources available  for learning more about weather that are referenced  at the appropriate point in this chapter. Much of the  following information can be found in the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 00-06A,  Aviation Weather For Pilots and Flight Operations Personnel,  and AC 00-45E, Aviation Weather Services, both of which  may be found at the FAA ’s Regulatory and Guidance Library  (RGL) located online at rgl.faa.gov.  

Other online sources for weather information are also helpful.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) offers a weather tutorial at www.srh.noaa.gov/srh/ jetstream/. Developed to meet the needs of educators, weather  professionals, and others interested in learning more about  weather, it provides a number of concise explanations of  weather theory. Additionally, ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/ home.rxml is a site developed as part of the Weather World  2010 project by the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at  the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  

This chapter is designed to give balloon pilots a basic  knowledge of weather principles, acquaint them with the  weather information available for flight planning, and help  them develop sound decision-making skills as they prepare  for and execute a safe flight.  

# The Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is the envelope of air that surrounds the  Earth. Approximately one-half of the air, by weight, is within  the lower 18,000 feet. The remainder of the air is spread over  a vertical distance in excess of 1,000 miles. No definite outer  atmospheric boundary exists, but the air particles become  less numerous with increasing altitude until they gradually  overcome Earth’s gravity and escape into space. In addition  to the rotation of the air with the rotation of the Earth, another  type of air movement occurs within the atmosphere. This  movement of air around the surface of the Earth is called  atmospheric circulation.  

# Composition  

The atmosphere is a blanket of air composed of a mixture  of gases that surrounds the Earth and reaches over 560  kilometers (km), 348 miles, from the surface. This blanket  of gases provides protection from ultraviolet rays, as well as  supporting human, animal, and plant life. Nitrogen accounts  for 78 percent of the gases comprising the atmosphere,  while oxygen makes up 21 percent.  [Figure 4-1]  Argon,  carbon dioxide, and traces of other gases make up the  remaining 1 percent. Within this envelope of gases, there  are several recognizable layers of the atmosphere as defined  by altitude.  

![](images/591589fc8612ebc0531f746d1c85b504d9c70842d375e1e1cbacae19e73740ee.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.  Composition of the atmosphere.  

The first layer, known as the troposphere, extends from sea  level up to 20,000 feet   $(8\,\mathrm{km})$   over the northern and southern  poles and up to 48,000 feet   $(14.5\ \mathrm{km})$   over the equatorial  regions. The vast majority of weather, clouds, storms, and  temperature variances occur within this first layer of the  atmosphere.  

At the top of the troposphere is a boundary known as the  tropopause, which traps moisture and the associated weather  in the troposphere. The altitude of the tropopause varies with  latitude and with the season of the year which causes it to  take on an elliptical shape, as opposed to round. Location  of the tropopause is important because it is commonly  associated with the location of the jet stream and possible  clear air turbulence.  

# The Standard Atmosphere  

To provide a common reference when discussing weather,  the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) has been  established. To arrive at the standard atmosphere, conditions  throughout the atmosphere with respect to latitudes, seasons,  and altitudes were averaged. The standard reference point is   $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , and 29.92 inches of mercury  $("\mathrm{Hg})$   or 1013.2  millibars (mb). Pressure does not decrease linearly with  altitude, but for the first 10,000 feet,   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   for each 1,000  feet approximates the rate of pressure change. There is also  a standard temperature lapse rate of  $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000  feet of altitude, up to 36,000 feet.  

At sea level, the atmosphere exerts pressure on the Earth at  a force of 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). This means a  column of air one inch square, extending from the surface up  to the upper atmospheric limit, weighs about 14.7 pounds.  

A person standing at sea level also experiences the pressure  of the atmosphere, but the pressure is a force of pressure  over the entire surface of the skin. The actual pressure at a  given place and time will differ with altitude, temperature,  and density of the air. These conditions also affect balloon  performance, especially with regard to useful load and burner  performance.  

# Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure  

Constant pressure charts and hurricane pressure reports  are written using millibars (mb). Since weather stations  are located around the globe, all local barometric pressure  readings are converted to a sea level pressure to provide a  standard for records and reports. To achieve this, each station  converts its barometric pressure by adding approximately   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain. For example,  a station at 5,000 feet above sea level, with a reading of 

  $24.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , reports a sea level pressure reading of 29.92 

 "Hg. Using common sea level pressure readings helps ensure  aircraft altimeters are set correctly, based on the current  pressure readings. In order to compensate for pressure  variations due to different station elevations, all observations  are mathematically corrected to mean sea level (MSL).  Altimeter settings are obtained by mathematically reducing  station pressure to MSL. This enables the pilot to read MSL  altitudes on the altimeter.  

When charting atmospheric pressures over various areas of the  Earth, the meteorologist is primarily interested in the pressure  difference per unit of distance—the pressure gradient.  

The MSL pressure is plotted in mb at each reporting station  on a surface weather map. The isobars outline pressure areas  in somewhat the same manner that contour lines outline  terrain features on contour maps. Standard procedure on  surface weather maps in North America is to draw isobars  spaced at four mb of pressure apart, with intermediate two  mb spacing when appropriate. Although the isobar patterns  are never the same on any two weather maps, they do show  patterns of similarity.  

By tracking barometric pressure trends across a large area,  weather forecasters can more accurately predict movement  of pressure systems and the associated weather. For example,  tracking a pattern of rising pressure at a single weather station  generally indicates the approach of fair weather. Conversely,  decreasing or rapidly falling pressure usually indicates  approaching bad weather and possibly severe storms.  

# Temperature  

Temperature is a measurement of the amount of heat and  expresses a degree of molecular activity. Since different  substances have different molecular structures, equal amounts  of heat applied to equal volumes of two different substances  will result in unequal heating. Every substance has its own  unique specific heat. For example, a land surface becomes  hotter than a water surface when equal amounts of heat are  added to each. The degree of “hotness” or “coldness” of a  substance is known as its temperature, and is measured with  a thermometer.  

The Earth’s surface is heated during the day by the sun.  This incoming solar radiation is called insolation, while  heat radiated from the Earth by outgoing radiation is called  terrestrial radiation. The cooling that occurs at night is  terrestrial radiation.  

# Temperature Scales  

Two temperature scales are important to the balloon pilot:  Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C). On the Fahrenheit scale,  the freezing point is   $32^{\circ}$   and the boiling point is   $212^{\circ}$  , a  difference of  $180^{\circ}$  . On the Celsius scale, the freezing point is   $0^{\circ}$   and the boiling point is  $100^{\circ}$  . For many years, the Celsius  scale was the choice for technicians and those countries and  organizations utilizing the metric system. In recent years,  the United States has transitioned to almost exclusive use of  the Celsius scale in weather reports, primarily because of the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convention  agreements.  [Figure 4-2]  

![](images/636175db70509168275768495dfbe3fe3a81fe7043e39748548ae5ae54b790bc.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.   Comparison of Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature  scales.  

A quick and easy way to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius is to  subtract 30, and divide the number by two. T o convert Celsius  to Fahrenheit, double the number, and add 30. These formulas  give a good approximation for most calculations in ballooning.  Conversion charts are also available on the Internet.  

# Temperature Variations  

The amount of solar radiation (insolation) received by any  region varies with the time of day, with seasons, and with  latitude. These differences in insolation create temperature  variations. Temperatures also vary with differences in  topographical surface and with altitude. These temperature  variations create forces that drive the atmosphere in its  motion. Simply stated, heat and, therefore, temperature  differences cause weather.  

Diurnal variation is the change in temperature from day  to night brought about by the daily rotation of the Earth.  The Earth receives heat during the day by insolation, but  continually loses heat by terrestrial radiation. Warming  and cooling depend on an imbalance of insolation and  terrestrial radiation. During the day, insolation exceeds  terrestrial radiation and the surface becomes warmer. At  night, insolation ceases, but terrestrial radiation continues  and cools the surface. Cooling continues after sunrise until  insolation again exceeds terrestrial radiation. Minimum  temperature usually occurs after sunrise, sometimes as much  as one hour after. The continued cooling after sunrise is one  reason that fog sometimes forms shortly after the sun is  above the horizon.  

# Temperature Variations with Topography  

T emperature variations are also induced by water and terrain.  Water absorbs and radiates heat energy with less temperature  change than does land. Large, deep water bodies tend to  minimize temperature changes, while large land masses  induce major temperature changes. Wet soil, such as that  found in swamps and marshes, is almost as effective as  water in suppressing temperature changes. Thick vegetation  tends to control temperature changes since it contains some  water and also insulates against heat transfer between the  ground and the atmosphere. Arid, barren surfaces generate  the greatest temperature changes.  

These topographical influences are both diurnal and seasonal.  For example, the difference between a daily maximum and  minimum may be   $10^{\circ}$   or less over water, near a shore line,  or over a swamp or marsh, while a difference of  $50^{\circ}$   or more  is common over rocky or sandy deserts.  

Abrupt temperature differences develop along lake and ocean  shores. These variations generate pressure differences and  local air flows or winds, which may become a consideration  in the balloon pilot’s study of the air mass.  

Prevailing wind is also a factor in temperature control. In  an area where prevailing winds are from large water bodies,  temperature changes are rather small. Most islands enjoy  fairly constant temperatures. On the other hand, temperature  changes are more pronounced where prevailing wind is from  dry, barren regions.  

# Temperature Variation with Altitude  

Temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude  throughout the troposphere. This decrease of temperature  with altitude is defined as lapse rate. The standard lapse rate  seldom exists. In fact, temperature sometimes increases with  height. An increase in temperature with altitude is defined  as an inversion.  

An inversion often develops near the ground on clear, cool  nights when wind is light. The ground radiates and cools  much faster than the overlying air. Air in contact with the  ground becomes cold, while the temperature a few hundred  feet above changes very little. Thus, temperature increases  with height. Inversions may also occur at any altitude when  conditions are favorable. For example, a current of warm  air aloft overrunning cold air near the surface produces an  inversion aloft.  

Low level inversions, which are usually of most interest to  the balloon pilot, generally dissipate as the air mixes with  insolation.  

# Heat Transfer  

The heat source for this planet is the sun; energy from the sun  is transferred through space and the Earth’s atmosphere to  the Earth’s surface. As this energy warms the Earth’s surface  and atmosphere, some of it is or becomes heat energy. Heat  is transferred into the atmosphere in three ways: radiation,  conduction, and convection.  

# Radiation  

Radiation is the transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves.  No medium of transfer is required between the radiator  and the body being irradiated (receiving the radiation).  Heat waves, a form of this electromagnetic energy, may be  reflected. In meteorology, the principal reflectors are the  Earth’s surface, water vapor in the air, and particulate matter  in the atmosphere.  

# Conduction  

Conduction is the transfer of heat energy from one substance  to another or within a substance. As with electricity,  some materials are good conductors while others are poor  conductors. Poor conductors are considered to be insulators.  Air is one of the poorest conductors of heat in comparison  to silver, one of the best conductors. Silver will pass 20,000  times more heat than an equal mass of air across a similar  temperature difference during a fixed period of time.  Conduction in the atmosphere is considered to be a significant  method of heat exchange only at the Earth’s surface, where  the lowest few centimeters of the atmosphere are actually in  contact with the ground or water.  

# Convection  

Convection is the transfer of heat energy in a fluid. This type  of heating is most commonly seen in the kitchen when a liquid  boils. This type of heat transfer occurs in the atmosphere  when the ground is heated by the sun. The warm ground heats  the air above it by radiation and conduction, causing the warm  air to rise. Meanwhile, the dense cooler air aloft moves in to  take the warm ground air’s place to be heated.  

Heat can be transferred by convection in either a vertical or  a horizontal direction. In meteorology, “advection” is the  term used for the horizontal transport of heat by wind. It is  important to differentiate between the vertical and horizontal  paths of convection. In the atmosphere, the amount of heat  transferred horizontally over the surface of the Earth by  advection is about 1,000 times greater than that transferred  by convection.  

# The Adiabatic Process  

The adiabatic process is the change of the temperature  of air without transferring heat. In an adiabatic process,  compression results in warming, and expansion results in  cooling. The adiabatic process takes place in all upward and  downward moving air. When air rises into an area of lower  pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the molecules  of air expand, the temperature of the air lowers. As a result,  when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume  increases, and temperature decreases. When air descends,  the opposite is true.  

Since air is composed of a mixture of gases subject to heating  when compressed and cooling when expanded, air will rise,  seeking a level where the pressure of the body of air is equal  to the pressure of the air that surrounds it. Whatever the  cause of the lifting, the air rises, and the pressure decreases,  allowing the “parcel of air” to expand. This continues until  it reaches an altitude similar in pressure and density to its  own. As it expands, it cools through the adiabatic process  and no heat is added or withdrawn from the system in which  it operates. As air rises, it is cooled because it is expanding  by moving to an altitude where pressure and density is less.  This is adiabatic cooling. When the process is reversed and  air is forced downward, it is compressed, causing it to heat  by a process called adiabatic heating.  

# Air Masses  

An air mass is a large body of air (usually 1,700 kilometers  or more across) whose physical properties (temperature and  humidity) are horizontally uniform. The weather is a direct  result of the continuous alternation of the influences of warm  and cold air masses. Warm air masses predominate in the  summer, and cold air masses predominate in the winter.  However, both cold and warm air, alternately, may prevail  almost anywhere in the temperature zone at any season. The  basic characteristics of any air mass are temperature and  humidity. These properties are relatively uniform throughout  the air mass, and it is by measurement of these properties that  the various types of air masses are determined.  

# Characteristics  

Air masses acquire the characteristics of the surrounding  area, or source region. The characteristics of an air mass  consist of the basic properties of moisture and temperature,  which include:  

•  Stability, •  Cloud types, •  Sky coverage, •  Visibility, •  Precipitation, •  Icing, and •  Turbulence.  

The terrain surface underlying the air mass is the primary  factor in determining air mass characteristics.  

A source region is typically an area in which the air remains  relatively stagnant for a period of days or longer. During  this time of stagnation, the air mass takes on the temperature  and moisture characteristics of the source region. Areas of  stagnation can be found in polar regions, tropical oceans,  and dry deserts. Air masses are classified by region of  origination:  

•  Polar or tropical •  Maritime or continental  

A continental polar air mass forms over a polar region and  brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air masses  form over warm tropical waters like the Caribbean Sea and  bring warm, moist air. As the air mass moves from its source  region and passes over land or water, the terrain it passes  over modifies its qualities, and thus modifies the nature of  the air mass.  

An air mass passing over a warmer surface will be warmed  from below, and convective currents form, causing the air  to rise. This creates an unstable air mass with good surface  visibility. Moist, unstable air causes cumulus clouds,  localized showers, and turbulence to form. Conversely, an air  mass passing over a colder surface does not form convective  currents, but instead creates a stable air mass with poor  surface visibility. The poor surface visibility is due to the fact  that moisture, smoke, dust, and other particles cannot rise out  of the air mass and are instead trapped near the surface. A  stable air mass can produce low stratus clouds and fog.  

# Pressure Systems  

The differences that occur with heating and cooling the  atmosphere in the lower levels also cause density variations.  These variations cause small horizontal pressure differences  that are only about one ten-thousandth of the magnitude of the  normal change of pressure with altitude, but they significantly  impact atmospheric circulation and most weather phenomena.  [Figure 4-3]  

A low or cyclone is a pressure system in which the barometric  pressure decreases towards the center and the wind flow  around the system is counterclockwise in the Northern  Hemisphere. Unfavorable flying conditions in the form of  low clouds, restricted visibility by precipitation and fog,  strong and gusty winds, and turbulence are common in low  pressure systems. Thermal low pressure systems caused by  intense surface heating and resulting low air density over  barren continental areas are relatively dry with few clouds and  practically no precipitation. Thermal lows are stationary and  predominate over continental areas in the summer. General  airflow in a low pressure system, since the atmosphere is  attempting to achieve equilibrium, is in (towards the center  of the low pressure system), and up. This tendency can affect  the overall dynamic of the low pressure system.  

A high is a pressure system in which the barometric pressure  increases toward the center and the wind flow around the  system is clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Flying  conditions are generally more favorable in highs than in  lows because of fewer clouds, light or calm winds, and  less concentrated turbulent areas. But, in some situations,  visibility may be reduced due to early morning fog, smog, or  haze at flight levels. High pressure systems predominate over  cold surfaces where the air is dense. General airflow in a high  pressure system, in reverse of the low pressure dynamic, is  out (away from the center of the pressure system) and down.  Again, these airflow tendencies can affect the dynamic of the  high pressure system, much like the low.  

In the Northern Hemisphere, a general cycle of highs and  lows moves through the temperate zones from west to east.  The movement of the pressure systems is more rapid in  the winter season when the low pressure systems are most  intense and the high pressure systems extend farthest to the  south.  [Figure 4-4]  

A trough is an elongated area of low pressure, with the lowest  pressure along the trough line. The weather in a trough is  commonly violent. Also, troughs can be slow moving.  

A ridge is an elongated area of high pressure with highest  pressure along the ridge line. The weather in a ridge is  generally favorable for flying.

# Fronts  

Fronts are the boundaries between two air masses and are  classified as to which type of air mass (cold or warm) is  replacing the other. For example, a cold front demarcates  the leading edge of a cold air mass displacing a warmer  air mass. A warm front is the leading edge of a warmer air  mass replacing a colder air mass. Fronts are also transition  zones (boundaries) between air masses that have different  densities. The density of air is controlled primarily by the  temperature of the air. Therefore, fronts in temperate zones  usually form between tropical and polar air masses, but  they may also form between arctic and polar air masses. A  typical surface weather map shows air mass boundary zones  at ground level. Designs on the boundary lines indicate the  type of front and its direction of movement. On weather  maps in local weather stations, fronts may also be indicated  by colored lines. A working knowledge of fronts and their  accompanying weather hazards is important to pilots.  

# Types of Fronts  

The four major frontal types are:  

•  Cold, •  Warm, •  Stationary, and •  Occluded.  

A front type is determined from the movement of the air  masses involved.  

# Cold Front  

A cold front is the leading edge of an advancing mass of cold  air. A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable  air advances and replaces a body of warmer air. Cold fronts  move more rapidly than warm fronts, generally progressing  at a rate of 25 to 30 miles per hour (mph). However, extreme  cold fronts have been recorded moving at speeds of up to 60  mph. A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that  of a warm front. Because it is so dense, it stays close to the  ground and acts like a snowplow, sliding under the warmer  air and forcing the less dense air aloft.  [Figure 4-5]  The  rapidly ascending air causes the temperature to decrease  suddenly, forcing the creation of clouds. The type of clouds  that form depends on the stability of the warmer air mass. A  cold front in the Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented  in a northeast to southwest manner and can extend for several  hundred miles, encompassing a large area of land. Prior to  the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform or towering  cumulus clouds are present, and cumulonimbus clouds are  possible. Rain showers and haze are possible due to the rapid  development of clouds. The wind from the south-southwest  helps to replace the warm temperatures with the relative  colder air. A high dew point and falling barometric pressure  are indicative of imminent cold front passage.  

As the cold front passes, towering cumulus or cumulonimbus  clouds continue to dominate the sky.  [Figure 4-6]  Depending  on the intensity of the cold front, heavy rain showers form  and might be accompanied by lightning, thunder, and/or hail.  More severe cold fronts can also produce tornadoes. During  cold front passage, the visibility is poor, with winds variable  and gusty, and the temperature and dew point drop rapidly. A  quickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out during frontal  passage, then begins a gradual increase. After frontal passage,  the towering cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds begin to  dissipate to cumulus clouds, with a corresponding decrease in  the precipitation. Good visibility eventually prevails with the  winds from the west-northwest. Temperatures remain cooler  and the barometric pressure continues to rise.

Figure 4-6.   A cold front underrunning warm, moist, unstable air. Clouds are cumuliform with possible showers or thunderstorms near  the surface position of the front. Convective clouds often develop in the warm air ahead of the front. The warm, wet ground behind the  front generates low-level convection and fair-weather cumulus in the cold air.  

# Fast-Moving Cold Front  

Fast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure  systems far behind the actual front. The friction between the  ground and the cold front retards the movement of the front  and creates a steeper frontal surface. This results in a very  narrow band of weather concentrated along the leading edge  of the front.  [Figure 4-7]  If the warm air being overtaken by  the cold front is relatively stable, overcast skies and rain may  occur for some distance ahead of the front. If the warm air  is unstable, scattered thunderstorms and rain showers may  form. A continuous line of thunderstorms, or squall line,  may form along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present  a serious hazard to pilots as squall type thunderstorms are  intense and move quickly. Behind a fast-moving cold front,  the skies usually clear rapidly and the front leaves behind  gusty, turbulent winds and colder temperatures.  

# Warm Front  

A warm front is actually the trailing edge of a retreating  mass of cold air. A warm front occurs when a warm mass  of air advances and replaces a body of colder air. Warm  fronts move slowly, typically 10 to   $25~\mathrm{mph}$  . The slope of  the advancing front slides over the top of the cooler air and  gradually pushes it out of the area. Warm fronts contain warm  air that often has very high humidity. As the warm air is lifted,  the temperature drops and condensation occurs. Prior to the  passage of a warm front, cirriform or stratiform clouds, along  with fog, can be expected to form along the frontal boundary. 

 [Figure 4-8]  In the summer months, cumulonimbus clouds 

 (thunderstorms) are likely to develop. Light to moderate  precipitation is probable, usually in the form of rain, sleet,  snow, or drizzle, punctuated by poor visibility. The wind  blows from the south-southeast, and the outside temperature

is cool or cold, with increasing dew point. Finally, as the  warm front approaches, the barometric pressure continues  to fall until the front passes completely.  

During the passage of a warm front, stratiform clouds are  visible and drizzle may be falling. The visibility is generally  poor, but improves with variable winds. The temperature rises  steadily from the inflow of relatively warmer air. Usually,  the dew point remains steady and the pressure levels off.  After the passage of a warm front, stratocumulus clouds  predominate and rain showers are possible. The visibility  eventually improves, but hazy conditions may exist for a  short period after passage. The wind generally blows from  the south-southwest. With warming temperatures, the dew  point rises and then levels off. There is generally a slight rise  in barometric pressure, followed by a decrease in barometric  pressure.  

# Stationary Front  

When an air mass boundary is neither advancing nor  retreating along the surface, the front is called a stationary  front. Although there is no movement of the surface  position of a true stationary front, an uplift of air may  occur along the frontal boundary. If the uplifted air is stable  and saturated, stratiform clouds may occur. Intermittent  drizzle may occur, and if lifted above the freezing level,  icing conditions and frozen precipitation will exist. If the  uplifted air is conditionally unstable and saturation occurs,  predominately cumuliform clouds will form, possibly  generating thunderstorm activity.  

# Occluded Front  

An occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold front  catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As the occluded  front approaches, warm front weather prevails, but is  immediately followed by cold front weather. There are two  types of occluded fronts that can occur, and the temperatures  of the colliding frontal systems play a large part in defining  the type of front and the resulting weather. A cold front  occlusion occurs when a fast-moving cold front is colder  than the air ahead of the slow-moving warm front. When  this occurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the  warm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the cold  front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found in both  warm and cold fronts, if the air is relatively stable. A warm  front occlusion occurs when the air ahead of the warm front  is colder than the air of the cold front. When this is the case,  the cold front rides up and over the warm front. If the air  forced aloft by the warm front occlusion is unstable, the  weather will be more severe than the weather found in a cold  front occlusion. Embedded thunderstorms, rain, and fog are  likely to occur.  

# Surface Fronts  

The air mass boundaries indicated on a surface weather map  are called surface fronts. A surface front is the position of a  front at the Earth’s surface. The weather map shows only the  location of fronts on the surface, but these fronts also have  vertical extent. For example, the colder, heavier air mass  tends to flow under the warmer air mass. The underrunning  mass produces the lifting action of warm air over cold air,  causing clouds and associated frontal weather.  

The vertical boundary between the warm and cold air masses  is a frontal surface, and slopes upward over the colder air  mass. The frontal surface lifts the warmer air mass and  produces frontal cloud systems. The slope of the frontal  surface varies with the speed of the moving cold air mass,  and the roughness of the underlying terrain. Under normal  conditions, the angle of inclination (slope ratio) between the  frontal surface and the Earth’s surface is greater with cold  fronts than with warm fronts. The approximate height of  the frontal surface over any station is determined from the  analysis of upper air observations.  

Frontal passage (FROPA) affects ballooning activities  because it can generate precipitation, wind shifts, significant  changes in temperature, and many other conditions hazardous  to ballooning. Balloon pilots usually do not fly in the face  of an approaching front; in fact, many have a rule that they  do not fly within 18 to 24 hours prior to frontal passage,  particularly if the approaching front has any significant  strength associated with it. The FSS often can advise of the  time a cold front will pass a given reporting station, which  assists in flight planning.  

# Winds and Currents  

Pressure and temperature changes produce two kinds of  motion in the atmosphere—vertical movement of ascending  and descending currents, and horizontal movement in the  form of wind. Both types of motion in the atmosphere are  important as they affect the takeoff, landing, and inflight  operations. More important, however, is that these motions  in the atmosphere, otherwise called atmospheric circulation,  cause weather changes.  

Understanding wind and current circulation patterns is  important for a balloon pilot because balloons are maneuvered  solely through interaction with the different layers of wind  and current. By using knowledge of the Coriolis force,  pressure gradient force, and surface friction, it is possible to  predict with a high degree of accuracy the potential track over  the countryside and land at a predetermined point. This skill  is the mark of a competent, safety conscious balloon pilot.  

# Atmospheric Circulation  

Three forces cause the wind to move as it does: the Coriolis  force, the pressure gradient force, and surface friction. All  three forces work together at the same time.  

As defined earlier, atmospheric circulation is the movement  of air around the surface of the Earth caused by the uneven  heating of the Earth’s surface that upsets the equilibrium  of the atmosphere, creates changes in air movement, and  affects atmospheric pressure. Because the Earth has a curved  surface that rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the sun, the  equatorial regions of the Earth receive a greater amount of  heat from the sun than the polar regions. The amount of sun  heating the Earth depends upon the time of day, time of year,  and the latitude of the specific region. All of these factors  affect the length of time and the angle at which sunlight  strikes the surface.  

In general atmospheric circulation theory, areas of low  pressure exist over the equatorial regions, and areas of high  pressure exist over the polar regions due to a difference in  temperature. Solar heating causes air to become less dense  and rise in equatorial areas. The resulting low pressure allows  the high pressure air at the poles to flow along the planet’s  surface toward the equator. As the warm air flows toward the  poles, it cools, becoming more dense, and sinks back toward  the surface.  [Figure 4-9]  This pattern of air circulation is  correct in theory, but the circulation of air is modified by  other forces.  

![](images/bbb97c712cb3c6d3145c8a3b9c3462f23f4d44419cb66b7b7ba73781f0fb5a8b.jpg)  
Figure 4-9.  General circulation theory.  

The speed of the Earth’s rotation causes the general flow  to break up into three distinct cells in each hemisphere.  [Figure 4-10]  In the Northern Hemisphere, the warm air at  the equator rises upward from the surface, travels northward,  and is deflected eastward by the rotation of the Earth. By  the time it has traveled one-third of the distance from the  equator to the North Pole, it is no longer moving northward,  but eastward. This air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at  about   $30^{\circ}$   latitude, creating an area of high pressure as it  sinks toward the surface. Then, it flows southward along  the surface back toward the equator. Coriolis force bends  the flow to the right, thus creating the northeasterly trade  winds that prevail from   $30^{\circ}$   latitude to the equator. Similar  forces create circulation cells that encircle the Earth between  

![](images/591eaae2250b38d08fba9edc6af3f0ebd8681a3b51bab1c125848c9196349992.jpg)  
Figure 4-10.  Three cell circulation pattern caused by the rotation  of the Earth.  

$30^{\circ}$   and   $60^{\circ}$   latitude, and between  $60^{\circ}$   and the poles. This  circulation pattern results in the prevailing westerly winds  in the conterminous United States.  

Circulation patterns are further complicated by seasonal  changes, differences between the surfaces of continents and  oceans, and other factors such as frictional forces caused  by the topography of the Earth’s surface which modify  the movement of the air in the atmosphere. For example,  within 2,000 feet of the ground, the friction between the  surface and the atmosphere slows the moving air. The wind  is diverted from its path because the frictional force reduces  the Coriolis force. Thus, the wind direction at the surface  varies somewhat from the wind direction just a few thousand  feet above the Earth.  

# Coriolis Force  

The Coriolis force is not perceptible to humans as they walk  around because humans move slowly and travel relatively  short distances compared to the size and rotation rate of  the Earth. However, the Coriolis force significantly affects  bodies that move over great distances, such as an air mass  or body of water.  

The Coriolis force deflects air to the right in the Northern  Hemisphere, causing it to follow a curved path instead of a  straight line. The amount of deflection differs depending on  the latitude. It is greatest at the poles, and diminishes to zero  at the equator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs  with the speed of the moving body—the faster the speed,  the greater the deviation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the  rotation of the Earth deflects moving air to the right and  changes the general circulation pattern of the air.  

Pertinent facts about the Coriolis force:  

•  The Coriolis force deflection is perpendicular to the  flow of air. •  The Coriolis force will deflect air to the right in the  Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern  Hemisphere. •  The Coriolis force is strongest at the Poles and  decreases to zero at the Equator. •  The Coriolis force is zero with calm winds and  increases in magnitude as wind speed increases. •  Coriolis force, in combination with other forces  involved, will determine the different circulation  patterns over the Earth.  

# Pressure Gradient  

Pressure gradient is the difference in pressure between high  and low pressure areas. It is the rate of change in pressure in  a direction perpendicular, or across the isobars. Wind speed is  directly proportional to the pressure gradient. This means the  strongest winds are in the areas where the pressure gradient  is the greatest. Since pressure applied to a fluid is exerted  equally in all directions throughout the fluid, a pressure  gradient exists in the horizontal (along the surface), as well  as in the vertical (with altitude) plane in the atmosphere.  [Figure 4-11]  

![](images/11de4a23bd5b1bb1dea8876fb2d4155f6c4a25502ce1fcd75f370991cd328885.jpg)  
Figure 4-11.  Principles of pressure gradients.  

The horizontal pressure gradient is steep or strong when the  isobars determining the pressure gradient are close together.  It is flat or weak when the isobars are far apart. If isobars  are considered as depicting atmospheric topography, a high  pressure system represents a hill of air, and a low pressure  system represents a valley of air. The vertical pressure  gradient always indicates a decrease in pressure with altitude,  but the rate of pressure decrease (gradient) varies directly  with changes in air density with altitude. The vertical cross  section through a high and a low depicts the surface pressure  gradient.  

The pressure gradient force is a force that tries to equalize  pressure differences. This is the force that causes high  pressure to push air toward low pressure. Thus, air would  flow from high to low pressure if the pressure gradient force  was the only force acting on it.  

# Surface Friction  

Friction is the third component that determines the flow of  wind. Because the surface of the Earth is rough, it not only  slows the wind down, it also causes the diverging winds from  highs and converging winds near lows. Since the Coriolis  force varies with the speed of the wind, a reduction in the  wind speed by friction means a reduction of the Coriolis  force. This results in a momentary disruption of the balance.  When the new balance (including friction) is reached, the  air flows at an angle across the isobars from high pressure  to low pressure. This angle varies from   $10^{\circ}$   over the ocean  to more than  $45^{\circ}$   over rugged terrain. Frictional effects on  the air are greatest near the ground, but the effects are also  carried aloft by turbulence. Surface friction is effective in  slowing the wind up to an average altitude of 2,000 feet above  the ground. Above this level, the effect of friction decreases  rapidly and may be considered negligible. Air above 2,000  feet above the ground normally flows parallel to the isobars.  [Figures 4-12  and  4-13]  

# Wind Patterns  

Since air always seeks out lower pressure, it flows from areas  of high pressure into those of low pressure. In the Northern  Hemisphere, this flow of air from areas of high to low  pressure is deflected to the right and produces a clockwise  circulation around an area of high pressure known as anti- cyclonic circulation. The opposite is true of low pressure  

![](images/959c94b3a91309d896ec283cecfd13c8fe3a1c01d6968f626b84611b7e727b5a.jpg)

Figure 4-13.  Gradient winds.  

areas; the air flows toward a low and is deflected to create a  counter-clockwise or cyclonic circulation.  

High pressure systems are generally areas of dry, stable,  descending air. Good weather is typically associated with  high pressure systems for this reason. Conversely, air flows  into a low pressure area to replace rising air. This air tends  to be unstable, and usually brings increasing cloudiness and  precipitation. Thus, bad weather is commonly associated  with areas of low pressure.  

# Convective Currents  

Convection currents refer to the upward moving portion of  a convection circulation, such as a thermal or the updraft  in cumulus clouds. The uneven heating of the air, due to  different surfaces radiating heat in varying amounts, create  small areas of local circulation. For example, plowed ground,  rocks, sand, and barren land give off a large amount of  heat, while water, trees, and other areas of vegetation tend  to absorb and retain heat. Convective currents cause the  bumpy, turbulent air sometimes experienced when flying at  lower altitudes during warmer weather. On a low altitude  flight over varying surfaces, updrafts are likely to occur over  pavement or barren places, and downdrafts often occur over  water or expansive areas of vegetation like a group of trees.  Typically, these turbulent conditions can be avoided by flying  at higher altitudes.  

Convective currents are particularly noticeable in areas with  a land mass directly adjacent to a large body of water, such  as an ocean, large lake, or other appreciable area of water.  During the day, land heats faster than water, so the air over the  land becomes warmer and less dense. It rises and is replaced  by cooler, denser air flowing in from over the water. This  causes an onshore wind, called a sea breeze. Conversely, at  night land cools faster than water, as does the corresponding  air. In this case, the warmer air over the water rises and is  replaced by the cooler, denser air from the land, creating an  offshore wind called a land breeze. This reverses the local  wind circulation pattern. Convective currents can occur  anywhere there is an uneven heating of the Earth’s surface.  [Figure 4-14]  

Convection currents close to the ground can affect a pilot’s  ability to control the balloon. On final approach, for example,  the rising air from terrain devoid of vegetation sometimes  produces a ballooning effect that can cause a pilot to overshoot  the intended landing spot. On the other hand, an approach  over a large body of water or an area of thick vegetation  tends to create a sinking effect that can cause an unwary  pilot to land short of the intended landing spot. This could  prove particularly hazardous to a balloon landing in a small,  confined area, as the “undershoot” of the approach could  potentially put the balloon into the trees or power lines.  

# The Jet Stream  

The jet stream refers to relatively strong winds concentrated  in a narrow stream in the atmosphere. These winds are  normally horizontal, high altitude winds. The position and  orientation of jet streams vary from day to day. General  weather patterns (hot/cold, wet/dry) are related closely to  the position, strength, and orientation of the jet stream (or jet  streams). A jet stream at low levels is known as a low level  jet stream. Since it is of interest primarily to high level flight,  further discussion is not necessary.  

![](images/814d9a144ee59e25d2827aba51d300afa4154a87de902fc92cfd231e21d74233.jpg)  
Figure 4-14.  Land-sea breezes.  

# Local and Small-Scale Winds  Gradient Winds  

Pressure gradients initiate the movement of air and as soon  as the air acquires velocity, the Coriolis force deflects it to  the right in the Northern Hemisphere. As the speed of the air  along the isobars increases, the Coriolis force becomes equal  and opposite to the pressure gradient force. After a period of  time, the air moves directly parallel to the curved isobars if  there is no frictional drag with the surface. The air no longer  moves toward lower pressure because the pressure gradient  force is completely neutralized by the Coriolis force and the  centrifugal force.  

# Orographic Winds  

The term “orographic” has multiple meanings, when placed  in the context of weather phenomena. In a general sense,  according to the American Meteorological Society, wind  flows that are caused, affected, or influenced by mountains  may be said to be orographic winds flows. The term has  come to mean any winds that are affected by terrain, not just  mountains; this definition is probably the most frequently  used, when discussing balloon flight.  

As a specific term, “orographic lifting” is defined as an  ascending air flow caused by mountains. The mechanisms  that produce the orographic lifting fall into two broad  categories:  

1.  The upward deflection of horizontal large-scale air  flow by the terrain acting as an obstacle or barrier,  or 2.  The daytime heating of mountain surfaces to produce  an anabatic flow (see below) along the slopes and  updrafts in the vicinity of mountain peaks.  

This definition, while strictly referring only to lifting by  mountains, is sometimes extended to include the effects  of hills or long sloping terrain. When sufficient moisture  is present in the rising air, Orographic fog or clouds may  form.  

# Anabatic Winds  

Anabatic winds are those that blow up a steep slope or  mountain side. It is sometimes referred to as an upslope flow.  These winds typically occur during the daytime in calm,  sunny weather. A hill or mountaintop may be warmed by  the sun, which in turn heats the air just above it. As that air  rises through convection, it creates a low pressure region,  into which the air at the bottom of the slope flows, and  causes winds.  

# Katabatic Winds  

Katabatic winds are the reverse of anabatic winds; that is,  they flow down slope, and most frequently at night. They are  created by the effect of the air near the ground losing heat  thru radiational cooling at a faster rate than air at a similar  altitude over the surrounding land mass.  

# Clouds  

Clouds are weather signposts in the sky. They provide the  balloon pilot with visible evidence of the atmospheric motion,  water content, and degree of stability. In this sense, clouds  are of significant importance to the aeronaut. However, when  they become too numerous or widespread, form at low levels,  or show extensive vertical development, they present weather  hazards to ballooning.  

Clouds are visible condensed moisture, consisting of droplets  of water or crystals of ice. They are supported and transported  by air movements as slow as one-tenth of a mile per hour.  Cloud formation is the direct result of saturation producing  processes which take place in the atmosphere. A pilot should  be able to identify cloud formations that are associated with  weather hazards. Knowledge of cloud types will also assist  the pilot in interpreting weather conditions from weather  reports and existing weather.  

# Cloud Formation  

Clouds are often indicative of future weather. For clouds to  form, there must be adequate water vapor and condensation  nuclei (miniscule particles of matter like dust, salt, and  smoke), as well as a method by which the air can be cooled.  When the air cools and reaches its saturation point, the  invisible water vapor changes into a visible state. Through  the processes of sublimation and condensation, moisture  condenses or sublimates onto condensation nuclei. The nuclei  are important because they provide a means for the moisture  to change from one state to another.  

Cloud type is determined by its height, shape, and behavior.  They are classified according to the height of their bases as  low, middle, or high clouds, as well as clouds with vertical  development. The International Cloud Classification is  designed to provide a uniform cloud classification system.  [Figure 4-15]  Within this system, cloud types are usually  divided into four major groups and further classified in terms  of their forms and appearance.  

![Figure 4-15.  Cloud classification per international agreement. ](images/36a8beca27686398749cd66f3262f0fb9af39909ac6989c22f135c55a6d82fd1.jpg)  
\* Cumulus and cumulonimbus are clouds with vertical   development. Their bases are usually below 6,500 feet, but   may be slightly higher. The tops of the cumulonimbus some   times exceed 60,000 feet.  

The four major groups are:  

•  Low clouds, •  Middle clouds, •  High clouds, and •  Clouds with vertical development.  

Cloud classification can be further broken down into specific  cloud types according to the outward appearance and cloud  composition. Knowing these terms can help identify visible  clouds. The following is a list of cloud classifications:  

•  Cumulus—heaped or piled clouds •  Stratus—formed in layers •  Cirrus—ringlets, fibrous clouds, also high-level clouds  above 20,000 feet •  Castellanus—common base with separate vertical  development, castle-like •  Lenticularus—lens shaped, formed over mountains in  strong winds •  Nimbus—rain-bearing clouds •  Fracto—ragged or broken •  Alto—meaning high, also middle-level clouds existing  at 5,000 to 20,000 feet

Figure 4-17.  Stratocumulus clouds.  

Low clouds are those that form near the Earth’s surface. The  low cloud group consists of stratus and stratocumulus clouds.  [Figures 4-16  and  4-17]  Clouds in this family create low  ceilings, hamper visibility, and can change rapidly. Because  of this, they influence flight planning and can make visual  flight rules (VFR) flight impossible. The bases of these  clouds can start near the surface, with the top extending  to 6,500 feet or more above the terrain. Low clouds are of  great importance to the balloon pilot, as they can create low  ceilings and poor visibility. The heights of the cloud bases  may change rapidly. If low clouds form below 50 feet, they  are classified as fog, and may completely blanket landmarks  and landing fields.  

Middle clouds form around 6,500 feet above ground level  (AGL) and extend up to 20,000 feet AGL. They are composed of  water, ice crystals, and supercooled water droplets. The middle  cloud group consists of altocumulus  [Figure 4-18] , altostratus,  and nimbostratus  [Figure 4-19]  clouds. Altocumulus clouds,  which usually form when altostratus clouds are breaking  apart, also may contain light turbulence and icing. Altostratus  clouds can produce turbulence and may contain moderate  icing. The altocumulus has many variations in appearance and  formation, whereas the altostratus varies mostly in thickness,  from very thin to several thousand feet. Bases of the middle  clouds start as low as 6,500 feet and tops can range as high as  20,000 feet above the terrain. These clouds may be composed  of ice crystals or water droplets (which may be supercooled).  Altocumulus rarely produces precipitation, but altostratus  usually indicates the proximity of unfavorable flying weather  and precipitation.  

![](images/4ae6b322433639940d648f60d0039ea12ddd0501a23b52e22c2697010153c890.jpg)  
Figure 4-18.  Altocumulus clouds.  

High clouds form above 20,000 feet AGL and usually form  only in stable air. The high cloud group consists of cirrus,  cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus clouds. The mean base level of  these three cloud types starts at 18,000 feet or higher above  terrain. Cirrus clouds  [Figure 4-20]  may give indications of  approaching weather changes. Cirriform clouds are composed  of ice crystals, are generally thin, and the outline of the sun  or moon may sometimes be seen through them, producing  a halo or corona effect. High clouds are generally of no  interest to the balloon pilot, other than they may indicate  future conditions.

Figure 4-20.  Cirrus clouds.  

Clouds with extensive vertical development are cumulus  clouds that build vertically into towering cumulus or  cumulonimbus clouds, often developing into thunderstorms.  The bases of these clouds form in the low to middle cloud  region, but can extend into high altitude cloud levels.  Towering cumulus clouds indicate areas of instability in the  atmosphere, and the air around and inside them is turbulent.  These clouds generally have their bases below 6,500 feet  above the terrain and tops sometimes extend above 60,000  feet. Clouds with extensive vertical development are caused  by lifting action, such as convective currents, orographic lift,  or frontal lift.  

Scattered cumulus or isolated cumulonimbus clouds seldom  present a flight problem, since these clouds can usually be  circumnavigated without difficulty. However, these clouds  may rapidly develop in groups or lines of cumulonimbus.  They may also become embedded and hidden in stratiform  clouds, resulting in hazardous flight conditions.  

Within the high, middle, and low cloud groups are two main  subdivisions. These are:  

•  Clouds formed when localized vertical currents carry  moist air upward to the condensation level. These  vertical development clouds are characterized by  their lumpy or billowy appearance, and are designated  cumuliform type clouds, meaning “accumulation” or  “heap.” Turbulent flying conditions usually exist in,  below, around, and above cumuliform clouds. •  Clouds formed when complete layers of air are cooled  until condensation takes place. These clouds are  stratiform type clouds, meaning “layered out,” since  they lie mostly in horizontal layers or sheets. Flight  in stratiform cloud conditions is usually smooth.  

In addition to the two main subdivisions discussed above,  is the word nimbus, meaning “rain cloud.” These clouds  normally produce heavy precipitation, either liquid or solid.  For example, a stratiform cloud producing precipitation is  referred to as nimbostratus, and a heavy, swelling cumulus  cloud that has grown into a thunderstorm is referred to as  cumulonimbus.  

Cumulonimbus clouds contain large amounts of moisture  and unstable air, and usually produce hazardous weather  phenomena such as lightning, hail, tornadoes, gusty winds,  and wind shear. These extensive vertical clouds can be  obscured by other cloud formations and are not always visible  from the ground or while in flight. When this happens, these  clouds are said to be embedded, hence the term, embedded  thunderstorms.  

To pilots, the cumulonimbus cloud is perhaps the most  dangerous cloud type. It appears individually or in groups and  is known as either an air mass or orographic thunderstorm.  Heating of the air near the Earth’s surface creates an air mass  thunderstorm; the upslope motion of air in the mountainous  regions causes orographic thunderstorms. Cumulonimbus  clouds that form in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands  of thunderstorms or squall lines.  

Knowledge of principal cloud types and the factors that affect  them helps the pilot visualize expected weather conditions,  and to recognize potential weather hazards.  

# Ceilings and Visibilities  

Ceilings and visibilities have an important role in the  classification of sky conditions, and are critical for the  definition of flight restrictions. It is necessary to define these  terms to make those distinctions clear for the balloon pilot.  

# Ceiling  

For aviation purposes, a ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds  reported as being broken or overcast, or the vertical visibility  into an obscuration like fog or haze.  

Observations are made using the concept of the “celestial  dome,” the hemisphere of sky which can be seen from a  specific point on the ground. Cloud coverage is reported  as the total cloud cover at and below a specific layer, and  is reported in one-eighth increments (octals). A ceiling is  reported as broken when five-eighths to seven-eighths of the  sky is covered with clouds. Overcast means the entire sky is  covered with clouds.  

Current ceiling information is reported by the aviation routine  weather report (METAR) and automated weather stations of  various types. Ceilings are reported in height AGL.  

# Visibility  

Closely related to cloud cover and reported ceilings is  visibility information. Visibility refers to the greatest  horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be  viewed with the naked eye. Visibilities reported in standard  weather reports are horizontal surface visibilities and are  generally considered linear. Predominant visibility is the  greatest horizontal distance over which objects can be seen  and identified over at least half of the horizon. In the United  States, prevailing visibilities are reported in statute miles  and portions thereof.  

Since prevailing visibility is used for reporting purposes,  three miles visibility does not mean that a pilot must have  one and one half miles visibility in front of and behind the  balloon, but that the predominant visibility in most quadrants  must be three miles.  

Current visibility is reported in METAR and other aviation  weather reports, as well as automated weather stations.  Visibility information is available during a preflight weather  briefing.  

# Temperature/Dew Point Relationship  

The relationship between dew point and temperature defines  the concept of relative humidity. The dew point, given in  degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no  more moisture. When the temperature of the air is reduced  to the dew point, the air is completely saturated and moisture  begins to condense out of the air in the form of fog, dew,  frost, clouds, rain, hail, or snow.  

As moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the altitude  where temperature and dew point reach the same value. When  lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate of  $5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   per 1,000 feet  and the dew point temperature decreases at a rate of   $1\,\,{^\circ\mathrm{F}}$  per 1,000 feet. This results in a convergence of temperature  and dew point at a rate of   $4.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   A pilot can determine the  height of the cloud base by applying the convergence rate  to the reported temperature and dew point in the following  manner:  

${\begin{array}{r l}&{{\mathrm{Zakrause~(T)=85~^{\circ}F}}}\\ &{{\mathrm{Dew~point~(DP)=71~^{\circ}F}}}\\ &{{\mathrm{Convective~Rate~(CR)=4.4^{\circ}}}}\\ &{{\mathrm{T-DP=Temerge~Dew~Point~Spreca}}}\\ &{{\mathrm{TDS:+CR=X}}}\\ &{{\mathrm{X}}\times1.000{\mathrm{~free=height~of~clout~base}}}\end{array}}$   1,000 feet = height of cloud base AGL  

Example:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}-71\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}=14\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}}\\ {14\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\div4.4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}=3.18}\end{array}
$$  

Explanation:  

With an outside air temperature (OAT) of  $85\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   at the surface,  and dew point at the surface of   $71\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$   the spread is   $14\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  Divide the temperature dew point spread by the convergence  rate of   $4.4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$   and multiply by 1,000 to determine the  approximate height of the cloud base.  

This relationship is useful in determining the height  of the overlying cloud base when completing preflight  preparations.  

# Fog  

Fog is a cloud that begins within 50 feet of the surface. It  typically occurs when the temperature of air near the ground  is cooled to the air’s dew point. At this point, water vapor in  the air condenses and becomes visible in the form of fog. Fog  is classified according to the manner in which it forms and  is dependent upon the current temperature and the amount  of water vapor in the air.  

Fog is composed of minute droplets of water or ice crystals  suspended in the atmosphere with no visible downward  motion. It is one of the most common and persistent weather  hazards encountered by balloonists. Similar to stratus clouds,  the base of fog is at the Earth’s surface while the base of  a cloud is at least 50 feet above the surface. Fog may be  distinguished from haze by its dampness and gray color. It is  hazardous during takeoffs and landings, as well as the inflight  process, because it restricts surface visibility. Knowledge of  fog formation and dissipation processes, as well as types of  fog help the balloon pilot plan a flight more accurately.  

# Fog Formation  

Since neither condensation nor sublimation occurs unless  the relative humidity is near 100 percent, a high relative  humidity is of prime importance in the formation of fog. The  natural conditions which bring about a high relative humidity  (saturation) are also fog-producing processes, such as the  evaporation of additional moisture into the air or cooling of the  air to its dew point temperature. A high relative humidity can  be estimated, from hourly sequence reports, by determining the  spread (difference in degrees) between the temperature and dew  point. Fog rarely occurs when the spread is more than  $2.2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  It is most frequent when the spread is less than  $1.1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  

A light wind is generally favorable for fog formation. It causes  a gentle mixing action, which spreads surface cooling through  a deeper layer of air and increases the thickness of the fog.  

Although most regions of the Earth have sufficient  condensation nuclei to permit fog formation, the amount of  smoke particles and sulphur compounds in the vicinity of  industrial areas is pronounced. In these regions, persistent  fog may occur with above average temperature-dew point  spreads.  

Fog tends to dissipate when the relative humidity decreases.  During this decrease, the water droplets evaporate or ice  crystals undergo sublimation, and the moisture is no longer  visible. Either strong winds or heating processes may cause  the decrease in relative humidity.  

# Some Fog Types and Characteristics  

Radiation Fog  

Radiation fog forms after the Earth has radiated back to the  atmosphere the heat gained during daylight hours. By early  morning, the temperature at the surface may drop more than   $11\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . Since the dew point temperature (moisture content) of  the air normally changes only a few degrees during the night, the  temperature-dew point spread will decrease as the air is cooled  by contact with the cold surface. If the radiational cooling is  sufficient, and other conditions are favorable, radiation fog  will form. Radiation fog is most likely when the:  

•  Sky is clear (maximum radiational cooling). •  Moisture content is high (narrow temperature-dew  point spread). •  Wind is light (less than 7 knots).  

Advection Fog  

The movement of warm moist air over a colder surface creates  advection fog which is common along coastal regions where  the temperature of the land surface and the water surface  contrasts. The southeastern area of the United States provides  ideal conditions for advection fog formation during the winter  months. If air flows (advection) from the Gulf of Mexico or  the Atlantic Ocean over the colder continent, this warm air  is cooled by contact with the cold ground. If the temperature  of the air is lowered to the dew point temperature, fog will  form. Advection fog, forming under these conditions, may  extend over larger areas of the nation east of the Rockies. It  may persist throughout the day or night until replaced by a  drier air mass.  

If advection fog forms over water, it is often referred to as  sea fog. Cold ocean currents, such as those off the coast of  California, may cool and saturate moist air coming from the  warmer areas of the open sea. Sea fog is often dense offshore,  as well as onshore.  

As advection fog moves inland during the winter, the colder  land surface often causes sufficient contact cooling to keep  the air saturated. The fog may then persist during the day or  with a wind speed of 10 to 15 knots.  

# Valley Fog  

During the evening hours, cold dense air will drain from  areas of higher elevation into low areas of valleys. As the  cool air accumulates in the valleys, the air temperature may  decrease to the dew point temperature, causing a dense  formation of valley fog. While higher elevations may often  remain clear throughout the night, the ceiling and visibility  become restricted in the valley.  

# Evaporation Fog  

Fog formed by the addition of moisture to the air is called  evaporation fog. The major types of evaporation fog are  frontal fog and steam fog.  

Frontal fog is normally associated with slow-moving winter  frontal systems. Frontal fog forms when liquid precipitation,  falling from the maritime tropical air above the frontal  surface, evaporates in the polar air below the frontal surface.  Evaporation from the falling drops may add sufficient water  vapor to the cold air to raise the dew point temperature to the  temperature of the air. The cold air will then be saturated,  and frontal fog will form. Frontal fog is common with active  warm fronts during all seasons. It occurs ahead of the surface  front in an area approximately 100 miles wide. It is, therefore,  frequently mixed with intermittent rain or drizzle. When fog  forms ahead of the warm front, it is called prefrontal fog.  A similar fog formation may occur in the polar air along a  stationary front. Occasionally, a slow-moving winter cold  front with light wind may generate fog. This fog forms  in the polar air behind the surface front and is known as  postfrontal fog.  

Steam fog forms when cold stable air flows over a nonfrozen  water surface that is several degrees warmer than the air. The  intense evaporation of moisture into the cold air saturates the  air and produces fog. Conditions favorable for steam fog are  common over lakes and rivers in the fall and over the ocean  in the winter when an offshore wind is blowing.  

# Atmospheric Stability and Instability  

A stable atmosphere resists upward or downward movement,  and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear.  An unstable atmosphere allows an upward or downward  disturbance to grow into a vertical or convective current  allowing small vertical air movements to become larger,  resulting in turbulent airflow and convective activity.  Instability can lead to significant turbulence, extensive  vertical clouds, and severe weather.  

Rising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air  pressure as altitude increases. The opposite is true of  descending air; as atmospheric pressure increases, the  temperature of descending air increases as it is compressed.  This adiabatic process (heating or cooling) takes place in all  upward and downward moving air.  

When air rises into an area of lower pressure, it expands  to a larger volume. As the molecules of air expand, the  temperature of the air lowers. As a result, when a parcel of air  rises, pressure decreases, volume increases, and temperature  decreases. When air descends, the opposite is true.  

Since water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases air  density, causing it to rise. Conversely, as moisture decreases,  air becomes denser and tends to sink. Since moist air cools  at a slower rate, it is generally less stable than dry air since  the moist air must rise higher before its temperature cools  to that of the surrounding air. The dry adiabatic lapse rate  (unsaturated air) is  $3\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(5.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   per 1,000 feet. The moist  adiabatic lapse rate varies from  $1.1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to  $2.8\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,(2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  )  per 1,000 feet. The combination of moisture and temperature  determine the stability of the air and the resulting weather.  Cool, dry air is very stable and resists vertical movement,  which leads to good and generally clear weather. The greatest  instability occurs when the air is moist and warm, as it is in  the tropical regions in the summer. Typically, thunderstorms  appear on a daily basis in these regions due to the instability  of the surrounding air.  

The normal flow of air tends to be horizontal. If this flow  is disturbed, a stable atmosphere will resist any upward or  downward displacement. It will tend to return quickly to  normal horizontal flow. An unstable atmosphere, on the other  hand, will allow these upward and downward disturbances  to grow, resulting in rough (turbulent) air. An example is the  towering thunderstorm which grows as a result of large and  intensive vertical movement or air. It climaxes in lightning,  thunder, and heavy precipitation, sometimes including hail.  

Atmospheric resistance to vertical motion, called stability,  depends upon the vertical distribution of the air’s weight at  a particular time. The weight varies with air temperature and  moisture content. In comparing two parcels of air, warmer air  is lighter than colder air, and moist air is lighter than dry air.  If air is relatively warmer or moister that its surroundings,  it is forced to rise and would be unstable. If the air is colder  or dryer than its surroundings, it will sink until it reaches its  equilibrium, and would be stable. The atmosphere can be at  equilibrium only when light air is above heavier air.  

Temperature has a significant effect on the stability or  instability of the air mass. Air heated near the Earth’s surface  on a hot summer day will rise. The speed and vertical extent  of its travel depends on the temperature distribution of the  atmosphere. Vertical air currents, resulting from the rise of  air, can vary from the severe downdraft and compensating  downdraft associated with thunderstorms to the closely  spaced upward and downward bumps that are felt on warm  days when flying at low levels. Since the temperature of air  is an indication of its density, a comparison of temperatures  from one level to another can approximate the degree of the  atmosphere’s stability, or how much it will tend to resist  vertical motion.  

# Types of Stability  

The five types of atmospheric stability are:  

•  Absolute stability •  Absolute instability •  Conditional instability •  Neutral stability •  Convective stability  

Absolute stability occurs when the actual lapse rate in a  layer of air is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate; that  air is absolutely stable regardless of the amount of moisture  it contains. A parcel of absolutely stable air which is lifted  becomes cooler than the surrounding air and sinks back to  its original position as soon as the lifting force is removed.  

Similarly, if forced to descend, it becomes warmer than the  surrounding air; like a cork in water, it rises to its original  position upon removal of the outside force.  

Absolute instability exists when the actual lapse rate in  a layer of air is greater than the dry adiabatic lapse rate;  that air is absolutely unstable regardless of the amount of  moisture it contains. A parcel of air lifted even slightly will  immediately be warmer than its surroundings, and, as with  a hot air balloon, will be forced to rise.  

Conditional instability exists when the temperature lapse rate  of the air involved lies between the moist and dry adiabatic  rates of cooling. Before the displaced air actually becomes  unstable, it must be lifted to a point where it is warmer than  the surrounding air. When this point has been reached, the  relatively warmer air continues to rise freely until, at some  higher altitude, its temperature has cooled to the temperature  of the surrounding air. In the instability process, numerous  variables tend to modify the air. One of the most important  of these variables is the process called entrainment. In this  process, air adjacent to the cumulus or mature thunderstorm  is drawn into the cloud primarily by strong updrafts within  the cloud. The entrained air modifies the temperature of the  air within the cloud as the two become mixed.  

Neutrally stable air is air with the same temperature, and there  is no parcel to rise or descend. For example, the surface area  in contact with that air is of the same temperature.  

The term convective instability refers to a condition in  which the air becomes unstable after lifting. From a physical  standpoint, it closely resembles a conditionally unstable  air mass, but has the mechanical lifting of thermal activity  impacting on the overall characteristics of the air.  

# Effects of Stable and Unstable Air  

The degree of stability of the atmosphere helps to determine  the type of clouds formed, if any. For example, if very  stable air is forced to ascend a mountain slope, clouds will  be layer-like with little vertical development and little or no  turbulence. Unstable air, if forced to ascend the slope, would  cause considerable vertical development and turbulence in  the cumulus-type clouds.  

If air is subsiding (sinking), the heat of compression  frequently causes an inversion of temperature which increases  the stability of the subsiding air. When this occurs, as in  winter high pressure systems, a surface inversion formed  by radiational cooling is sometimes already present. The  subsidence-produced inversion, in this case, will intensify  the surface inversion, placing a strong “lid” above smoke and  haze. Poor visibility in the lower levels of the atmosphere  results, especially near industrial areas. Such conditions  frequently persist for days, notably in the Great Basin region  of the western United States.  

# Weather Hazards  

# Turbulence  

Turbulence is the irregular motion of the atmosphere as  indicated by gusts and lulls in the wind. Since turbulence is  associated with many different weather situations, knowledge  of its causes and its behavior will help a balloon pilot avoid  or minimize its effects.  

Turbulence can be divided into four categories according to  the specific causes:  

•  Thermal—caused by localized convective currents due  to surface heating or unstable lapse rates and cold air  moving over warmer ground or water •  Mechanical—resulting from wind flowing over  irregular terrain or obstructions •  Frontal—resulting from the local lifting of warm air  by cold air masses, or the abrupt wind shift (shear)  associated with most cold fronts •  Wind shear—marked gradient in wind speed and/or  direction due to general vibrations in the temperature  and pressure fields aloft  

Two or more of the above causative factors often work  together. In addition, turbulence is produced by manmade  phenomena.  

# Thermal  

A thermal is simply the updraft in a small-scale convective  current. Convective currents (vertical or horizontal air  movements) develop in air, which is heated by contact with  a warm surface. This heating from below occurs when either  cold air is advected (moved horizontally) over a warmer  surface or the ground is strongly heated by solar radiation.  

The strength of convective currents depends in part on the  extent to which the Earth’s surface has been heated, which  depends upon the nature of the surface. Barren surfaces, such  as sandy or rocky wasteland and plowed fields, are heated  more rapidly than surfaces covered in vegetation. Thus,  barren surfaces generally cause stronger convection currents.  In comparison, water surfaces are heated more slowly.  

When air is very dry, convective currents may be present  although convective-type clouds (cumulus) are absent. The  general upper limits of the convective currents are often  marked by the tops of cumulus clouds, which form in them  when the air is moist, or by haze lines. However, turbulence  may extend beyond this boundary. Varying types of surfaces,  and the resultant thermal conditions, can affect a balloon to  a considerable extent.  

The balloon pilot caught in a thermal will recognize the  condition by an increase in altitude without application of  heat from the balloon’s heater. This ascent can be rapid and  may exceed the maximum rate of climb limitations in the  balloon’s flight manual. Since the air mass is also rising with  the balloon, there is no significant pressure against the top  of the balloon. Thus, the top cap will not be pushed open  (commonly referred to as “floating the top”).  

Depending on their size, some thermals may have a rotative  motion similar to a small low pressure system. This motion  draws the balloon in and forces it to fly in an uncontrolled  circle. For balloons caught in a thermal, remember the adage  “altitude is your friend.” First, the pilot should insure there  is sufficient altitude to clear potential obstacles. Second,  maintain the temperature in the balloon appropriate for level  flight. Many pilots attempt to descend immediately, but this  may put the balloon, as well as the passengers, at risk of an  uncontrolled descent with possible injury. Most thermals  have a short lift span. In almost all cases, the thermal will  “spit” the balloon out the top after a short time, and the pilot  may descend and land as necessary.  

# Mechanical  

When the air near the surface of the Earth flows over  obstructions, such as irregular terrain, (bluffs, hills,  mountains) and buildings, the normal horizontal wind flow  is disturbed. As a result, it is transformed into eddies or  other irregular air movements.  Figure 4-21  shows how the  buildings or other obstructions near a launch site or landing  field can cause turbulence.  

The strength and magnitude of mechanical turbulence  depends on:  

•  The speed of the wind, •  The nature of the obstruction, •  The stability of the air, and •  The angle at which the wind moves over the  obstacle.  

Stability seems to be the most important factor in  determining the strength and vertical extent of the mechanical  turbulence.  

# Frontal  

Frontal turbulence is cause by the lifting of warm air by a  frontal surface, leading to instability and/or the mixing or  

![](images/76511860ae5d7cc55c9690cc997863c40cd0f5a7613bc8c33e28fafa67c0e263.jpg)  
Figure 4-21.   Surface obstructions cause eddies and other irregular  air movements.  

shear between the warm and cold air masses. The vertical  currents in the warm air are strongest when the warm air  is moist and unstable. The most severe cases of frontal  turbulence are generally associated with fast moving cold  fronts. In these cases, mixing between the two air masses,  as well as the differences in wind speed and/or direction add  to the intensity of the turbulence.  

# Wind Shear  

Wind shear is a relatively steep gradient in wind velocity  along a given line of direction (either vertical or horizontal)  and produces churning motions (eddies) which result in  turbulence. The greater the change of wind speed and/or  direction in the given direction, the greater the shear and  associated turbulence.  

Clear-air turbulence (CAT), or sudden severe turbulence  that occurs in cloudless regions, is associated with wind  shear, particularly between the core of a jet stream and the  surrounding air. CAT is not limited to the vicinity of the jet  stream and may occur in isolated regions of the atmosphere.  For example, the turbulence in a mountain wave can also  be classified as CAT because the identifying clouds in the  wave do not necessarily have to occur for the turbulence to  be present.  

Sometimes during a climb or descent, a balloon encounters a  narrow zone of wind shear with its accompanying turbulence  at the top of a temperature inversion. These inversions occur  anywhere from just above the surface to the tropopause.  

Strong inversions near the ground are an extreme form of  wind shear that adversely affect balloon takeoffs and landings.  For example, a pocket of calm, cold air forms in a valley as a  result of nighttime cooling, but the warmer air moving over  it has not been affected appreciably. Due to the difference  between the two bodies of air, a narrow layer of very turbulent  air may form. A balloon climbing or descending through this  zone will usually encounter considerable turbulence, as well  as changes in lift.  

# Low Level Wind Shear  

Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in windspeed and/or  direction over a very small area. Wind shear can subject a  balloon to violent updrafts and downdrafts, as well as abrupt  changes to the horizontal movement of the balloon. While  wind shear can occur at any altitude, low level wind shear is  especially hazardous due to the proximity of a balloon to the  ground. Directional wind changes of  $180^{\circ}$   and speed changes  of 50 knots or more are associated with low level wind shear.  Low level wind shear is commonly associated with passing  frontal systems, thunderstorms, and temperature inversions  with strong upper level winds (greater than 25 knots).  

Wind shear is hazardous to a balloon for several reasons.  The rapid changes in wind direction and velocity changes  the wind’s relation to the balloon disrupting the normal flight  attitude and performance of the balloon.  

# Obstructions and Wind  

As mentioned earlier, obstructions on the ground affect  the flow of wind and can be an unseen danger, causing yet  another atmospheric hazard for pilots. For example, ground  topography and large buildings can break up the flow of the  wind and create wind gusts that change rapidly in direction  and speed. Obstructions range from manmade structures, such  as hangars, to large natural obstructions, such as mountains,  bluffs, or canyons. A safe pilot is vigilant when flying in or  out of launch or landing sites that have large buildings or  natural obstructions located near them.  

The intensity of the turbulence associated with ground  obstructions depends on the size of the obstacle and the  primary velocity of the wind. This can affect the takeoff  and landing performance of a balloon, and can present a  very serious hazard. During the landing phase of flight, a  balloon may “drop in” due to the turbulent air and be too  low to clear obstacles during the approach. Disrupted airflow  often extends horizontally as much as ten times the height  of the object, if the winds are in the eight to ten knot range.  Balloon pilots should be aware of this, and make adjustments  accordingly when attempting to launch next to an obstruction,  or when landing just past one.  

This same condition is even more noticeable when flying  in mountainous regions. While the wind flows smoothly up  the windward side of the mountain and the upward currents  help to carry an aircraft over the peak of the mountain, the  wind on the leeward side does not act in a similar manner.  As the air flows down the leeward side of the mountain,  the air follows the contour of the terrain and is increasingly  turbulent. This tends to push an aircraft into the side of a  mountain. The stronger the wind, the greater the downward  pressure and turbulence become.  

Due to the effect terrain has on the wind in valleys or canyons,  downdrafts may be severe. Thus, a prudent balloonist is well  advised to seek out another balloon pilot with mountain flying  experience and get a mountain “checkout” before conducting  a flight in or near mountainous terrain.  

# Mountain Wave  

A mountain wave is the wavelike effect, characterized by  updrafts and downdrafts, that occurs above and behind  a mountain range when rapidly flowing air encounters  the mountain range’s steep front. The characteristics of a  typical mountain wave are represented in  Figure 4-22  which  illustrates how air flows with relative smoothness in its lifting  component as the wave current moves along the windward  side of the mountain. Wind speed gradually increases,  reaching a maximum near the summit. On passing the crest,  the flow breaks into a much more complicated pattern, with  downdrafts predominating.  

An indication of the possible intensities in the mountain wave  is reflected in verified records of sustained downdrafts and  updrafts in excess of 3,000 feet per minute (fpm). Turbulence  in varying degrees can be expected, with particularly severe  turbulence in the lower levels. Proceeding downwind 5 to  10 miles from the summit, the airflow begins to ascend as  part of a definite wave pattern. Additional waves, generally  less intense than the primary wave, may form downwind.  This event is much like the series of ripples that form  downstream from a rock submerged in a swiftly flowing  river. The distance between successive waves (wavelength)  usually ranges from 2 to 10 miles, depending on existing  wind speed and atmospheric stability, although waves up to  20 miles apart have been reported.  

![](images/df7c3acd9149ae3deb2d73beffbc860698eb18063a6eba9df94995f7eccbc2ff.jpg)  
Figure 4-22.  Characteristics of a mountain wave.  

Characteristic cloud forms peculiar to wave action provide  the best means of identification. Lenticular clouds, formed by  mountain waves, are smooth in contour.  [Figure 4-23]  These  clouds may occur alone or in layers at heights above 20,000  feet MSL, and be quite ragged when the airflow at that level  is turbulent. The roll cloud forms at a lower level, generally  near the height of the mountain ridge. The cap cloud must  always be avoided in flight because of turbulence, concealed  mountain peaks, and strong downdrafts on the lee slope. The  lenticulars, like the roll and cap clouds, are stationary. They  are constantly forming on the windward side and dissipating  on the lee side of the mountain wave.  

# Rotors  

Rotors or eddies can also be found embedded in mountain  waves. Formation of rotors can also occur as a result of down  slope winds. Their formation usually occurs where wind  speeds change in a wave or where friction slows the wind  near the ground. These rotors are often experienced as gusts  or wind shear. Clouds may also form within a rotor.  

![](images/e89b12a6bf376e2dc8b56841eb60355658444fb48a75f1331620fa77d319daed.jpg)  
Figure 4-23.   Multiple lenticular clouds over Mount Shasta,  California.  

Research on mountain waves and rotors or eddies continues,  but there is no doubt that pilots need to be aware of these  phenomena and take appropriate precautions. Although  mountain wave activity is normally forecast, many local  factors may affect the formation of rotors and eddies. When  planning a flight, a pilot should take note of the winds and  terrain to assess the likelihood of waves and rotors. There may  be telltale signs in flight, including disturbances on water or  wheat fields and the formation of clouds, provided there is  sufficient humidity to allow cloud formation.  

# Thunderstorms  

A thunderstorm is a local storm produced by a cumulonimbus  cloud and accompanied by lightning and thunder.  Thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds contain many  of the most severe atmospheric hazards for the balloon  pilot. They are almost always accompanied by strong gusty  winds, severe turbulence, heavy rain showers, and lightning.  These hazards may extend well away from the central core  of the thunderstorm mass, sometimes as much as 30 miles  or more.  

Ceilings and visibility in the precipitation areas under the  thunderstorms are normally poor. Because of the heavy  precipitation, the ceiling reported is at best an estimate  of where the pilot may break out into visual contact with  the surface. The weather observer determines the vertical  visibility into the precipitation, which may be significantly  different from the slant-range of the pilot.  

Potentially hazardous turbulence, as well as many other  hazards associated with thunderstorms, make a thunderstorm  a dangerous weather formation. The safe balloon pilot avoids  any conditions that may expose him or her to potential  thunderstorm activity. He or she exercises discretion and good  judgment when potential thunderstorm conditions exist.  

# Structure of Thunderstorms  

Convective Cells  

The fundamental structural element of the thunderstorm is  the unit of convective circulation known as a convective cell.  A mature thunderstorm contains one or more of these cells  in different stages of development, each varying in diameter  from one to five miles. By radar analysis and measurement  of drafts, it has been determined that each cell is generally  independent of surrounding cells in the same storm. Each  thunderstorm progresses through a life cycle from 1 to 3  hours, depending upon the number of cells contained and  their stage of development. In the initial stage (cumulus), the  cloud consists of a single cell. As the development progresses,  however, new cells may form as older cells dissipate.  

# Stages in Thunderstorm Development  

The life cycle of each thunderstorm cell consists of three  distinct stages:  

•  Cumulus, •  Mature, and •  Dissipating.  

Cumulus Stage  

Although most cumulus clouds do not become thunderstorms,  the initial stage of a thunderstorm is always a cumulus cloud.  [Figure 4-24]  The chief distinguishing feature of the cumulus  or building stage is an updraft that prevails throughout the  entire cell. This updraft may vary from a few feet per second  to as much as  $6{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}$   (65 knots) in mature cells. As an  updraft continues through the vertical extent of the cell, water  droplets grow in size and raindrops are formed.  

# Mature Stage  

The beginning of surface rain and adjacent updrafts and  downdrafts initiates the mature stage.  [Figure 4-25]  By this  time, the average cell has attained a height of 25,000 feet. As  the drops begin to fall, the surrounding air begins a downward  motion because of frictional drag. This descending air will be  colder that its surroundings and its rate of downward motion  is accelerated, forming the downdraft. The downdraft reaches  maximum speed a short time after rain begins to fall in the  cloud. Downdrafts occur at all levels within the storm, and  their speed ranges from a few feet per minute to about 2,500  fpm (25 knots). Significant downdrafts never extend from  the top of the cell because moisture is not sufficient in the  upper levels for raindrops to form. At these high levels, only  ice crystals, snowflakes, and supercooled water are present.  Therefore, their rate of fall is insufficient to cause appreciable  downdrafts. The mature cell generally extends far above  25,000 feet—in some cases up to 70,000 feet. In the middle  levels, around 14,000 feet, strong updrafts and downdrafts are

adjacent to each other. A shear action exists between these  drafts and produces strong and frequent gusts.  

# Dissipating or Anvil Stage  

Throughout the life span of the mature cell, more and more  air aloft is entrained by the falling raindrops. Consequently,  the downdraft spreads out to take the place of the weakening  updrafts. As this process progresses, the entire lower  portion of the cell becomes an area of downdraft. Since  updrafts are necessary to produce condensation and release  latent heat energy, the entire structure begins to dissipate.  

[Figure 4-26]  The strong winds aloft carry the upper section  of the cloud into the familiar anvil form (cumulonimbus  cloud). However, the appearance of the anvil does not always  indicate that the thunderstorm is dissipating.  

![](images/8290c65fa5bf66cb6b3fe09598ebed84088b752b5126b22b011854b640f75140.jpg)  
Figure 4-26.  Dissipating thunderstorm.  

A significant thunderstorm hazard is the rapid change in  wind direction and wind speed immediately prior to storm  passage at the surface. These strong winds are the result of  the horizontal spreading of the storm’s downdraft current  as they approach the surface of the earth. This initial wind  surge, as observed at the surface, is known as a first gust. The  speed of this first gust may exceed 75 knots and vary  $180^{\circ}$   in  direction from the previously prevailing surface winds. First- gust speeds average about 15 knots over prevailing velocities,  and average an approximately  $40^{\circ}$   change in the direction of  the wind. First gusts usually precede the heavy precipitation,  and strong gusts may continue for approximately 5 to 10  minutes with each thunderstorm cell. First gusts are not  limited to the area ahead of the storm’s movement. They  may be found in all sectors, including the area back of the  storm’s movement.  

During the passage of a thunderstorm, rapid and marked  surface variations generally occur. These variations usually  occur in a particular sequence characterized by:  

•  An abrupt fall in pressure as the storm approaches. •  An abrupt rise in pressure associated with rain showers  as the storm moves on and the rain ceases.  

All thunderstorms are similar in physical makeup, but for  purposes of identification they are divided into two general  groups: frontal and air mass. This division gives the balloon  pilot an indication of the method by which the storms are  formed and the distribution of the clouds over the area. The  specific nomenclature of these thunderstorms depends upon  the manner in which the lifting action occurs.  

# Frontal Thunderstorms  

Thunderstorms may occur within the cloud system of any front:  warm, cold, stationary, or occluded. Frontal thunderstorms  are caused by the lifting of warm, moist, conditionally  unstable air over a frontal surface. Thunderstorms may also  occur many miles ahead of a rapidly moving cold front, and  are called prefrontal or squall line thunderstorms.  

Warm front thunderstorms are caused when warm, moist,  conditionally unstable air is forced aloft over a colder, denser  shelf of retreating air. Because the frontal surface is shallow,  the air is lifted gradually. The lifting condensation level is  normally reached long before the level of free convection,  thus producing stratiform clouds. The level of free convection  is normally reached in isolated areas along the frontal surface.  This is the area where the greatest amount of water vapor is  present in the warm air being lifted. Therefore, warm front  thunderstorms are generally scattered. When the level of free  convection is reached, warm front thunderstorms may form.  These thunderstorms may prove particularly hazardous, as  they are frequently obscured by the surrounding stratiform  clouds.  

Cold front thunderstorms are caused by the forward motion of  a wedge of cold air under a mass of warm, moist, conditionally  unstable air (cold front), increasing the possibility for  thunderstorms to develop. The slope of a typical cold frontal  surface is relatively steep, so the lifting condensation level  and the level of free convection are usually near the same  altitude. Cold front thunderstorms are typically positioned  along the frontal surface in what appears to be a continuous  line. These storms are easily recognized from the air, because  they are partly visible from the front and rear of the storm  line. However, if the slope of the frontal surface is shallow,  the lifting action is not sufficient to produce thunderstorms in  lines (line squalls). With a shallow front, the thunderstorms  form behind the surface front and are widely scattered. Such  storms may be concealed by the surrounding cloud layers.  

Lines of thunderstorms frequently develop ahead of rapidly  moving cold fronts. These are known as prefrontal squall  lines, and frequently form parallel to the cold front. Prefrontal  squall line thunderstorms are usually more violent than cold  front thunderstorms. They are most active between noon  and midnight. The cold front cloud system usually weakens  during the period of the greatest prefrontal squall line activity  because the warm air displaced by the frontal surface has  lost its moisture and energy in the prefrontal thunderstorms.  In the United States, tornadoes are frequently associated  with strong prefrontal squall lines. Pre-frontal squall line  thunderstorms are indicated on a surface weather map by an  alternate dash-dot-dash line (display).  

The distribution of stationary front thunderstorms is  controlled by the slope of the frontal surface. Steeply sloped  stationary fronts tend to have lines of storms, whereas shallow  stationary fronts tend to have widely scattered storms.  

Occluded front thunderstorms are associated with the  two types of occluded fronts (warm front and cold front  occlusions), and are usually cold front thunderstorms that  have been moved into the area of warm frontal weather by  the occlusion process. They are found along the upper front,  and are normally strongest for a distance of 50 to 100 miles  north of the peak of the warm sector.  

# Air Mass Thunderstorms  

The two types of air mass thunderstorms are locally convective  and orographic. Both types form within air masses, and are  randomly distributed throughout the air mass.  

Convective thunderstorms are often caused by solar heating  of the land, which provides heat to the air, thereby resulting in  thermal convection. Relatively cool air flowing over a warmer  water surface may also produce sufficient convection to cause  thunderstorms. The land-type convective thunderstorms  normally form during the afternoon hours, after the Earth  has gained maximum heating from the sun. If cool, moist,  conditionally unstable air is passing over this land area,  heating from below will cause convective currents, thereby  resulting in towering cumulus or thunderstorm activity.  Dissipation usually occurs during the early evening hours, as  the land begins to lose its heat to the atmosphere. Although  convective thunderstorms form as individual cells, they may  become so numerous over a particular geographical area that  continued flight cannot be maintained.  

Thunderstorms over the ocean are most common during the  night and early morning. They frequently occur offshore  when a land breeze is blowing toward the water. The cool  land breeze is heated by the warmer water surface, which  results in sufficient convection to produce thunderstorms.  After sunrise, heating of the land surface reverses the airflow  (sea breeze). The thunderstorms then dissipate over the water,  but they may re-form over the warmer land surface. As an  example, the air mass weather that exists in Florida combines  both types of convective thunderstorms. Circulation around  a semipermanent high pressure system off the southeastern  United States (Bermuda high) carries moist ocean air over  the warm land surface of the Florida Peninsula. At night,  thunderstorms off the Florida Coast are caused by the warm  water of the Gulf Stream heating the surface air, while the  upper air is cooling by radiation to space. This heating from  below produces thermal convection over the water. When  the sun rises, the heat balance necessary to maintain storm  formation over the water is destroyed. By day, the storms  appear to move inward over the land areas, but actually  dissipate off the coast and re-form over the hot landmass.  The heated land surface sets up an unstable lapse rate over  the Peninsula and causes storm development to continue until  nocturnal cooling occurs. Usually, convective type storms  are randomly distributed and easily recognized.  

Orographic thunderstorms will form on the windward side  of a mountain if conditionally unstable air is lifted above the  level of free convection. The storm activity is usually scattered  along the individual peaks of the mountains. Occasionally,  however, this activity may form a long unbroken line of  storms similar to a squall line. The storms persist as long as  the circulation causes upslope motion. From the windward  side of the mountains, identification of orographic storms  may sometimes be difficult because the storm clouds are  obscured by other clouds (usually stratiform). Almost without  exception, orographic thunderstorms enshroud mountain  peaks or hills.  

# Minimum Factors  

The minimum factors essential to the formation of a  thunderstorm are conditionally unstable air with relatively  high moisture content and some type of lifting action. Lifting  of warm air will not necessarily cause free convection. The  air may be lifted to a point where the moisture condenses  and clouds form. These cloud layers, however, will be  stable if the level of free convection has not been reached  by the lifting. Conversely, it is possible for dry heated air  to rise convectively without the formation of clouds. In this  condition, turbulence might be experienced in perfectly  clear weather. Cumulonimbus cloud formations require a  combination of conditionally unstable air, some type of lifting  actions, and high moisture content. Once a cloud has formed,  the latent heat of condensation released by the change of state  from vapor to liquid tends to make the air more unstable.  

Some type of external lifting action is necessary to bring  the warm surface air to the point where it will continue to  rise freely (the level of free convection). For example, an air  mass may be lifted by thermal convection, terrain, fronts, or  convergence.  

# Summary  

By no means is the information contained here a complete  discussion of all the weather information and factors affecting  balloon flight. There are many resources available, both  through government and private agencies, which may be of  value to the pilot in planning a flight. A pilot should take the  time to explore the internet, read weather books, and gain a  complete understanding of the myriad of weather information  and products that are available.  

The second section of this chapter will expose the reader  to some of the weather reporting products available, both  through FSS briefings and Internet searches. With the  knowledge gained from the first half of this chapter, the pilot  will be able to make a good interpretation of the reports, and  determine how present and future conditions will affect the  decision to fly.  

# How to Obtain Weather Information  

An integral part of flight preparation for any pilot is checking  the weather conditions expected to occur during the flight.  FAA regulations place the responsibility for flight planning  on the pilot. To effectively plan a flight, a pilot needs to  understand what weather information is available, how to  obtain it, and how it can be applied to a flight.  

While weather forecasts are not 100 percent accurate,  meteorologists, through careful scientific study and computer  modeling, have the ability to predict the weather patterns,  trends, and characteristics with increasing accuracy. Through  a complex system of weather services, government agencies,  and independent weather observers, pilots and other aviation  professionals receive the benefit of this vast knowledge base  in the form of up-to-date weather reports and forecasts.  These reports and forecasts enable pilots to make informed  decisions regarding weather and flight safety.  

# Sources for Weather Information  

There are many sources available for today’s pilot when  gathering information about weather prior to a flight. A  review of pertinent weather reports and information is  required by FAA regulations and the following sources  provide excellent weather information. For the balloon pilot,  experience and study helps him or her determine the preferred  sources for weather information.  

# FAA Flight Service Stations (FSS)  

The FAA FSS is the primary source for preflight weather  information. FSS can be contacted by calling 1-800- WXBRIEF. It also logs pilot contacts to provide background  information in the event of an accident or incident, as well as  substantiating workload statistics. It is one of the two sources  of an official weather briefing.  

Although there are currently 44 FSS operations, the FAA  plans to automate the service and reduce the physical  locations eventually to three. Due to this, occasional extended  wait times can occur, particularly during periods of marginal  or severe weather. T o facilitate the process, inform the briefer  prior to the start of the briefing of the information needed.  

# Internet Sources  

A wealth of internet sources exist for the balloon pilot seeking  information about current weather conditions.  

•  Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS)   (www. duats.com —probably the most well-known of the  many internet based weather sites, DUATS provides  an on-line “official” briefing service at no cost to the  aviation community. The site is a contracted function  of the FAA, and is available to anyone who registers.  Besides the normal briefing that can be received  from the FSS, there are a number of graphic products  available that enhance the user’s understanding of  current and forecast weather. •  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   (NOAA) (www.noaa.gov) —NOAA operates the  National Weather Service (NWS) at www.nws.noaa. gov which provides access to weather information  collected on a continuing basis throughout the  country.  

NOAA also offers pilots an interactive page at www. weather.gov/view/largemap.php that is activated on  a state-by-state basis and provides hourly weather  observations at selected points.  [Figure 4-27]  This  weather information helps a pilot determine trends  in winds and pressure systems, which are prime  indicators of general conditions for balloon pilots.  

![](images/bad7c3ce1989ff36b3211d06d84ef9174ba950d51fd029c6f6328c7133e10030.jpg)  
Figure 4-27.   This map can be used to gather hourly AWOS and ASOS  type weather information from various sites in each state.  

•  National Center for Atmospheric Research and the  University Corporation for Atmospheric Research  (www.ucar.edu) —a collaborative effort of research  centers, universities, and weather offices around the  United States, this site provides numerous real-time  and forecast weather products and graphics. •  Aviation Digital Data Services (ADDS) (www. aviationweather.gov) —the Aviation Digital Data  Service (ADDS) makes text, digital and graphical  forecasts, analyses, and observations of aviation- related weather variables available to the aviation  community. The ADDS graphics and charts are often  easier to interpret than those of the AWC website.  •  Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS)  Weather Display   (www.weather.aero/hems) —the  ADDS development team created an experimental tool  designed to show weather conditions for short-distance  and low-altitude flights common for the helicopter  emergency medical services (HEMS) community at  the request of the FAA.  [Figure 4-28]  This interactive  site allows the user to determine ceiling and visibility  and winds (at 500 foot increments) for an area as small  as  $5\mathbf{k}^{2}$  . While not specifically targeted nor designed for  the balloon pilot’s use, the information obtained from  this site is helpful to the pilot planning a flight at some  distance from a normal weather reporting facility.  

# Interpreting Weather Charts and Reports  

A weather chart is any chart or map that presents data and  analysis that describe the state of the atmosphere over an  extended region at a given time. Weather charts provide a  picture of the overall movement of major weather systems  and fronts and are used in flight planning.  

Three useful weather charts for balloon pilots are: surface  analysis, weather depiction, and radar summary charts. These  three charts present current weather information and provide  “big picture” information for weather systems across the  United States. The composite moisture stability chart, constant  pressure analysis charts, and significant weather prognostic  charts provide additional information for flight planning.  

Knowledge of all these weather charts, reports, and forecasts  may not be necessary for the pilot planning a local flight, but  an understanding of large scale weather patterns and systems  bring a greater understanding of how those systems affect  local weather. It is important to gain an understanding of the  primary charts used, and develop interpolation skills to be  able to perform safe, adequate flight planning.  

# Surface Analysis Chart  

The surface analysis chart is computer-generated, covers the  contiguous 48 states and adjacent areas, and is transmitted  every 3 hours with an analysis of the current surface  weather. It shows the areas of high and low pressure, fronts,  temperatures, dew points, wind directions and speeds, local  weather, and visual obstructions.  [Figure 4-29]  

Surface weather observations for reporting points across the  United States are also depicted on this chart. Each of these  reporting points is illustrated by a station model.  

•  Type of observation—a round model indicates an  official weather observer made the observation. A  square model indicates the observation is from an  automated station. Stations located offshore give data  from ships, buoys, or offshore platforms. •  Sky cover—the station model depicts total sky cover  and will be shown as clear, scattered, broken, overcast,  or obscured/partially obscured. •  Clouds—cloud types are represented by specific  symbols. Low cloud symbols are placed beneath the  station model, while middle and high cloud symbols  are placed directly above the station model. Typically,  only one type of cloud will be depicted with the station  model. •  Sea level pressure—sea level pressure given in three  digits to the nearest tenth of a mb. For   $1{,}000~\mathrm{mb}$   or  greater, prefix a ten to the three digits. For less than   $1{,}000\,\mathrm{mb}$  , prefix a nine to the three digits. •  Pressure change/tendency—pressure change in tenths  of mb over the past 3 hours. This is depicted directly  below the sea level pressure. •  Precipitation—a record of the precipitation that has  fallen over the last 6 hours to the nearest hundredth  of an inch. •  Dew point—dew point is given in degrees  Fahrenheit. •  Present weather—over 100 different weather symbols  are used to describe the current weather. •  Temperature—temperature is given in degrees  Fahrenheit. •  Wind—true direction of wind is given by the wind  pointer line, indicating the direction from which the  wind is coming. A short barb is equal to five knots of  wind, a long barb is equal to ten knots of wind, and a  pennant is equal to 50 knots.

Figure 4-29.   Example of a section of a surface analysis chart with station model legend (inset).  

# Weather Depiction Chart  

A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as  derived from METAR and other surface observations. It  is prepared and transmitted by computer every 3 hours  beginning at 0100 Zulu time (0100Z), and is valid at the time  of the plotted data. Designed to be used for flight planning,  it gives an overall picture of the weather across the United  States.  [Figure 4-30]  

The weather depiction typically displays major fronts or  areas of high and low pressure. It also provides a graphic  display of Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), VFR, and marginal  VFR (MVFR) weather. Areas of IFR conditions (ceilings  less than 1,000 feet and visibility less than 3 miles) are  shown by a hatched area outlined by a smooth line. MVFR  regions (ceilings 1,000 to 3,000 feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles)  are shown by a non-hatched area outlined by a smooth line.  Areas of VFR (no ceiling or ceiling greater than 3,000 feet  and visibility greater than 5 miles) are not outlined. Weather  depiction charts show a modified station model that provides  sky conditions in the form of total sky cover, cloud height or  ceiling, weather, and obstructions to visibility, but does not  include winds or pressure readings like the surface analysis  chart. A bracket ( ] ) symbol to the right of the station  indicates the observation was made by an automated station.  

A detailed explanation of a station model is depicted in the  previous discussion of surface analysis charts.  

# Radar Summary Chart (SD)  

A radar summary chart  [Figure 4-31]  is a computer-generated  graphical display of a collection of automated radar weather  reports (SDs). The chart is published hourly, 35 minutes  past the hour. It displays areas of precipitation as well as  information regarding the characteristics of the precipitation.  An SD chart includes:  

•  No information—if information is not reported, the  chart will read “NA.” If no echoes are detected, the  chart will read “NE.” •  Precipitation intensity contours—intensity can be  described as one of six levels and is shown on the  chart by three contour intervals. •  Height of tops—the heights of the echo tops are given  in hundreds of feet MSL. •  Movement of cells—individual cell movement is  indicated by an arrow pointing in the direction of  movement. The speed of movement in knots is the  number at the top of the arrow head. “LM” indicates  little movement.  

![](images/845c38db1fb100d76f63d1d2a928857df37ddb360d8c096a3eb4f58a29908b6d.jpg)

Figure 4-31.   Radar summary chart.  

•  Type of precipitation—the type of precipitation is  marked on the chart using specific symbols. •  Echo configuration—echoes are shown as areas, cells,  or lines. •  Weather watches—severe weather watch areas for  tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are depicted by  boxes outlined with heavy dashed lines.  

A valuable tool for preflight planning, the SD chart has  several limitations. Since it depicts only areas of current  precipitation, it will not show areas of clouds and fog with no  appreciable precipitation, or the height of the tops and bases  of the clouds. SD charts should be used in conjunction with  current METAR and weather forecasts.  

# Composite Moisture Stability Chart  

The composite moisture stability chart is a chart composed  of four panels depicting stability, precipitable water,  freezing level, and average relative humidity conditions.  This computer-generated chart contains data obtained from  upper-air observations, is updated twice a day, and shows  the relative stability of the air mass and the potential for  thunderstorms or thermal activity.  

# Stability/Lifted Index Chart  

A subdisplay of the composition moisture stability chart is  the stability or lifted index (LI) chart, a valuable tool for  determining the stability of the atmosphere. The stability  or LI chart is the upper left hand panel of the composite  moisture stability chart. Two indexes represent the moisture  and stability of the air: the K index (KI) and the LI, with  these numbers composing a fraction. KI (denominator of the  fraction) provides moisture and stability information. Values  range from high positive values to low negative values. A  high positive KI indicates moist, unstable air. KI values are  considered high when at or above   $+20$  , and low when less  than  $+20$  .  [Figure 4-32]  

The LI (numerator of the fraction) is a common measure of  atmospheric stability. It is calculated by hypothetically lifting  a parcel of air to the  $500\,\mathrm{mb}$   level, approximately 18,000 feet  MSL, and analyzing its stability at that level. A positive LI  indicates that a particular parcel of air is stable and resists  further upward motion. Large positive values (  $^{'}\!\!+8$   or greater)  would indicate very stable air. Conversely, a negative LI  means that a lifted surface parcel of air is unstable, and more  likely to rise. Large negative values (  $(-6$   or more) indicate  very unstable air.  

![](images/224fd3e8c88d64116bbe06f59e4bbf996c93aee765d4244691c9907cdffb3836.jpg)  
Figure 4-32.   Lifted index chart.  

The KI and LI can be used together to determine the moisture  and stability characteristics of a particular air mass. The  air masses may be classified as moist and stable, moist  and unstable, dry and stable, or dry and unstable. This  determination allows the balloon pilot to make an informed  decision regarding the likelihood of thermal and potential  thunderstorms, and if a safe flight can be conducted.  

# Constant Pressure Analysis Charts  

A constant pressure analysis chart or isobaric chart is a  weather map representing conditions on a surface of equal  atmospheric pressure.  [Figure 4-33]  For example, a  $500\,\mathrm{mb}$  chart will display conditions at the level of the atmosphere at  which the atmospheric pressure is  $500\,\mathrm{mb}$  . The height above  sea level at which the pressure is that particular value may  vary from one location to another at any given time, and also  varies with time at any one location, so it does not represent  a surface of constant altitude/height.  

Constant pressure charts provide the pilot with a clearer  picture of how the atmosphere behaves at different altitudes  and pressures. For example, a low pressure system that seems  insignificant based on surface observations may prove to be  a major factor in the weather at five or ten thousand feet.  

Constant pressure charts are prepared for selected values of  pressure and present weather information at various altitudes.  Standard charting values are at  $850\,\mathrm{mb}$   (approximately 5,000  feet MSL),   $700~\mathrm{mb}$   (approximately 10,000 feet MSL), 500  mb (approximately 18,000 feet MSL), as well as higher and  lower altitudes. Charts with higher pressure altitudes present  

![](images/4c9dde1a22c1b01fb1d3b49988f34ffa5a85655a98f1c93ab652dca45d3d2735.jpg)  
Figure 4-33.   Constant pressure analysis chart.  

information at lower altitudes, and charts with lower pressure  altitudes present information at higher altitudes.  

Symbology on the constant pressure analysis chart is  the same as that of the surface analysis chart. This chart  depicts the information at a specific pressure altitude. When  compared with the surface analysis of the same time frame,  a three-dimensional concept of the atmosphere can be  conceptualized, and the pilot can gain a greater understanding  of the atmospheric dynamics involved in weather patterns.  

# Significant Weather Prognostic Charts  

Significant weather prognostic charts  [Figure 4-34]  display  the observed or forecast significant weather phenomena at  different flight levels that may affect the operation of aircraft.  They are available for low-level significant weather from the  surface to FL 240 (24,000 feet), also referred to as the 400  mb level, and high-level significant weather from FL 250 to  FL 600 (25,000 to 60,000 feet). This discussion involves the  low-level significant weather prognostic chart.  

The low-level chart comes in two forms: the 12- and 24-hour  forecast chart, and the 36- and 48-hour surface only forecast  chart. The first chart is a four-panel chart that includes 12- and  24-hour forecasts for significant weather and surface weather.  Charts are issued four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z,  and 1800Z. The valid time for the chart is printed on the lower  left corner of each panel. The upper two panels show forecast  significant weather, which may include nonconvective  turbulence, freezing levels, and IFR or MVFR weather. Areas  of moderate or greater turbulence are enclosed in dashed  lines. Numbers within these areas give the height of the  turbulence in hundreds of feet MSL. Figures below the line  show the anticipated base, while figures above the line show  the top of the zone of turbulence. Also shown on this panel  are areas of VFR, IFR, and MVFR. IFR areas are enclosed by  solid lines, MVFR areas are enclosed by scalloped lines, and  the remaining, unenclosed area is designated VFR. Zigzag  lines and the letters “SFC” (surface) indicate freezing levels  in that area are at the surface. Freezing level height contours  for the highest freezing level are drawn at 4,000 foot intervals  with dashed lines.  

# Additional Weather Information  Skew-T Plots  

Most weather information is derived from radiosondes, or  weather balloons, that are released from over 100 stations in  the United States twice daily (00Z and 12Z). The observations  of temperature and humidity at various pressure altitudes are  transmitted back to the releasing station; the radiosondes are  also tracked by radar in order to determine wind speed and  direction. This information is plotted to create a diagram  known as a Skew-T/Log-P plot, commonly referred to as a  Skew-T. These plots can be found at many different online

weather sites; perhaps the easiest to use is rucsoundings.noaa. gov. The appropriate plot for any of the reporting sites can  be found by typing in the closest reporting station identifier  (usually an airport), and allowing the graphic to load.  

There is a wealth of information that may be derived from  the Skew-T plot (or “sounding,” as it may be referred to), but  this discussion will be limited to those features of immediate  interest to the average balloon pilot.  

Some of the information that may be derived from the Skew- T, using the example in  Figure 4-35:  

•  The two lines running vertically through the center  of the graphic (red and blue) show the temperature  and dew point at ascending pressure altitudes. The  temperature is always plotted to the right of the dew  point because temperature is almost always greater  than the dew point temperature.  •  The right side margin shows wind speed and direction,  using the standard “barbed” system common in  weather reporting. The scale (in this case, 0 to 40  knots) can be changed, but this setting provides the  best resolution.  •  The left margin of the chart indicates the pressure  altitude for a particular reading. Pressure altitude  readings correspond generally to certain altitudes. For  example, the reading at  $850\,\mathrm{mb}$   equates roughly to an  

altitude of 5,000 feet above MSL. That may not appear  to be useful; however, this is where the dynamics  of the application come into play. If the computer  cursor is moved over the graphic part of the diagram,  indicators as to the specific information for that  altitude may be seen (not depicted in  Figure 4-35 ).  A pilot may be able to get information for varying  altitudes as close at 125 feet apart, depending on the  resolution of the original sounding information.  

There is a tutorial available to fully explain the data  interpretation of the Skew T plot at www.met.tamu.edu/class/ ATMO151/tut/sound/soundmain.html.  

# Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD)Winds  

Velocity Azimuth display (VAD) winds are derived from  the output of the 160 WSR-88 radar sites located throughout  the United States. These radar systems are used by weather  professionals to produce many different products, including  the weather radar depictions found on many of the web sites  previously discussed, as well as various television station  weather reporting.  [Figure 4-36]  

The WSR-88 radar systems can be configured to produce  radar returns from dust and other particulate matter that may  be in the air. These radar returns can be processed to indicate  wind direction and speed at different altitudes. VAD winds  are generally reported in 1,000 foot increments, although at

times reports may be as small as 150 feet between altitudes.  Standard “wind barb” depictions are used to represent the  wind direction and speed at different altitudes.  

Plymouth State University in Plymouth, New Hampshire  operates a Weather Center with a website for locating VAD  winds. This user-friendly website offers pilots a convenient  selection of reporting stations at http://vortex.plymouth. edu/lnids_conus.html.  

# Aviation Forecasts  

Observed weather condition reports are often used in the  creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of different  forecast products are produced and designed to be used in  the preflight planning stage. Pilots need to be familiar with  the following printed forecasts: wind and temperature aloft  forecasts (FD reports), the terminal aerodrome forecast  (TAF), aviation area forecast (FA), and inflight weather  advisories (SIGMET, AIRMET).  

# Wind and Temperature Aloft Forecast (FD Report)  

Wind and temperature aloft forecasts provide wind and  temperature forecasts for specific locations in the contiguous  United States, plus network locations in Hawaii and Alaska.  The forecasts are made twice a day based on the radiosonde  upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z. Up through  12,000 feet are true altitudes; at and above 18,000 feet are  pressure altitudes. Wind direction is always in reference to  true north, and wind speed is given in knots. The temperature  is given in degrees Celsius; no winds are forecast when  a given level is within 1,500 feet of the station elevation.  Similarly, temperatures are not forecast for any station  within 2,500 feet of the station elevation. If the wind speed is  forecast to be greater than 100 knots but less than 199 knots,  the computer adds 50 to the direction and subtracts 100 from  the speed. A sample FD report is shown in  Figure 4-37 .  

To decode this type of data group, the reverse process must  be accomplished. For example, when the data appears as  “731960,” subtract 50 from the 73 and add 100 to the 19;  the wind would be   $230^{\circ}$   at 119 knots with a temperature of   $-60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . If the wind speed is forecast to be 200 knots or greater,  the wind group is coded as 99 knots. When the data appears  as “7799,” subtract 50 from 77 and add 100 to 99; the wind  is  $270^{\circ}$   at 199 knots or greater. When the forecast wind speed  is calm or less than 5 knots, the data group is coded “9900,”  which means light and variable.  

# Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)  

METAR is an observation of current surface weather reported  in a standard international format. While the METAR code  has been adopted worldwide, each country is allowed to make  

#

# Figure 4-37.   Sample FD report.  

modifications to the code. This discussion of METAR will  cover elements used in the United States.  

# Example:  

METAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26 3/4SM $^+$ TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK PRESFR  

A typical METAR report contains the following information  in sequential order:  

1.  Type of report—the first of two types of METAR  reports is the routine METAR report that is transmitted  every hour. The second is the aviation selected special  weather report (SPECI). This is a special report that  can be given at any time to update the METAR for  rapidly changing weather conditions, aircraft mishaps,  or other critical information.  

2.  Station identifier—each station is identified by a four- letter code as established by the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO). In the 48 contiguous  states, a unique three-letter identifier is preceded by  the letter “K.” For example, Gregg County Airport in  Longview, T exas, is identified by the letters “KGGG,”  K being the country designation and GGG being  the airport identifier. In other regions of the world,  

including Alaska and Hawaii, the first two letters of  the four-letter ICAO identifier indicate the region,  country, or state. Alaska identifiers always begin with  the letters “PA ” and Hawaii identifiers always begin  with the letters “PH.” A list of station identifiers can  be found at an FSS or NWS office or online at www. eurocontrol.int/icaoref/.  

3.  Date and time of report—are depicted in a six-digit  group (e.g., 161753Z). The first two digits of the six- digit group are the date. The last four digits are the time  of the METAR, which is always given in Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC). A “Z” is appended to the end  of the time to denote the time is given in Zulu time  (UTC) as opposed to local time.  

4.  Modifier—denotes that the METAR came from an  automated source or that the report was corrected.  If the notation “ AUTO” is listed in the METAR, the  report came from an automated source. It also lists  “ AO1” or  AO2” in the remarks section to indicate  the type of precipitation sensors employed at the  automated station. When the modifier “COR” is used,  it identifies a corrected report sent out to replace an  earlier report that contained an error (for example:  METAR KGGG 161753Z COR).  

5.  Wind—reported with five digits (e.g., 14021) unless  the speed is greater than 99 knots, which requires  six digits. The first three digits indicate the direction  the wind is blowing in tens of degrees. If the wind is  variable, it is reported as “VRB.” The last two digits  indicate the speed of the wind in knots (KT) unless  the wind is greater than 99 knots, which requires three  digits. If the winds are gusting, the letter “G” follows  the wind speed. After the letter “G,” the peak gust  recorded is provided (e.g., 21G26). If the wind varies  more than  $60^{\circ}$   and the wind speed is greater than 6  knots, a separate group of numbers, separated by a “V ,”  will indicate the extremes of the wind directions.  

6.  Visibility—the prevailing visibility (e.g.,  3/4  SM)  is reported in statute miles as denoted by the letters  “SM.” It is reported in both miles and fractions of  miles. At times, runway visual range (RVR) is reported  following the prevailing visibility. RVR is the distance  a pilot can see down the runway in a moving aircraft.  When RVR is reported, it is shown with an R, then the  runway number followed by a slant, then the visual  range in feet. For example, when the RVR is reported  as R17L/1400FT , it translates to a visual range of 1,400  feet on runway 17 left.  

7.  Weather—broken down into two different categories:  qualifiers and weather phenomenon (e.g.,   $+\mathrm{TSRA}$    BR). First, the qualifiers of intensity, proximity,  and the descriptor of the weather will be given. The  intensity may be light   $(-)$  , moderate ( ), or heavy   $(+)$  . Proximity depicts only weather phenomena  that are in the airport vicinity. The notation “VC”  indicates a specific weather phenomenon is in the  vicinity of 5 to 10 miles from the airport. Descriptors  are used to describe certain types of precipitation  and obscurations. Weather phenomena may be  reported as being precipitation, obscurations, and  other phenomena such as squalls or funnel clouds.  Descriptions of weather phenomena as they begin or  end, and hailstone size are also listed in the remarks  sections of the report.  

8.  Sky condition—always reported in the sequence of  amount, height, and type or indefinite ceiling/height  (vertical visibility) (e.g., BKN008 OVC012CB).  The heights of the cloud bases are reported with a  three-digit number in hundreds of feet above the  ground. Clouds above 12,000 feet are not detected  or reported by an automated station. The types of  clouds, specifically towering cumulus (TCU) or  cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, are reported with their  height. Contractions are used to describe the amount  of cloud coverage and obscuring phenomena. The  amount of sky coverage is reported in eighths of the  sky from horizon to horizon.  

9.  Temperature and dew point—always given in degrees  Celsius (e.g., 18/17). Temperatures below   $0~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   are  preceded by the letter “M” to indicate minus.  

10.  Altimeter setting—reported as inches of mercury in  a four-digit number group, and is always preceded  by the letter “A” (e.g., A2970). Rising or falling  pressure may also be denoted in the remarks sections  as “PRESRR” or “PRESFR” respectively.  

11.  Remarks—comments may or may not appear in this  section of the METAR. The information contained in  this section may include wind data, variable visibility,  beginning and ending times of particular phenomenon,  pressure information, and various other information  deemed necessary. An example of a remark regarding  weather phenomenon that does not fit in any other  category would be: OCNL LTGICCG. This translates  as occasional lightning in the clouds, and from cloud  to ground. Automated stations also use the remarks  section to indicate the equipment needs maintenance.  The remarks section always begins with the letters  “RMK.”  

Example:  

# METAR BTR 161753Z 14021G26 3/4SM -RA BR BKN008 OVC012 18/17 A2970 RMK PRESFR

# Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts   $(T\!A F)$  

A terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) is a report established  for the five statute mile radius around an airport. TAF reports  are usually given for larger airports. Each TAF is valid for a  24-hour time period, and is updated four times a day at 0000Z,  0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. TAF utilizes the same descriptors  and abbreviations as used in the METAR report.  

The terminal forecast includes the following information in  sequential order:  

1.  Type of report—TAF can be either a routine forecast  (TAF) or an amended forecast (TAF AMD). 2.  ICAO station identifier—The station identifier is the  same as that used in a METAR. 3.  Date and Time of Origin—reported in a six-digit code.  The first two indicate the date, the last four indicate  the time. Time is always given in UTC as denoted by  the “Z” following the number group. 4.  Valid period date and time—the valid forecast time  period is reported in a six-digit number group. The  first two numbers indicate the date, followed by the  two-digit beginning time for the valid period, followed  by the two digit ending time. 5.  Forecast Wind—the wind direction and speed forecast  are reported in a five-digit number group. The first  three digits indicate the direction of the wind in  reference to true north. The last two digits state the  windspeed in knots, as denoted by the letters “KT.”  

As in the METAR, winds greater than 99 knots are  given in three digits.

 6.  Forecast visibility—reported in statute miles, in whole  numbers or fractions. If the forecast visibility is greater  than 6 miles, it will be coded as “P6SM.”

 7.  Forecast significant weather—weather phenomenon  is coded in the TAF reports in the same format as the  METAR. If no significant weather is expected during  the forecast time period, the denotation “NSW” will  be included in the “becoming” or “temporary” weather  groups.

 8.  Forecast sky condition—reported in the same manner  as the METAR. Only cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are  forecast in this portion of the TAF report as opposed  to CBs and towering cumulus in the METAR.

 9.  Forecast change group—for any significant weather  change forecast to occur during the TAF time period,  the expected conditions and time period are included  in this group. This information may be shown as  From (FM), Becoming (BECMG), and Temporary  (TEMPO). “From” is used when a rapid and  significant change, usually within an hour, is expected.  “Becoming” is used when a gradual change in the  weather is expected over a period of no more than 2  hours. “T emporary” is used for temporary fluctuations  of weather, expected to last for less than an hour.

 10.  Probability forecast—a given percentage that describes  the probability of thunderstorms and precipitation  occurring in the coming hours. This forecast is not  used for the first 6 hours of the 24-hour forecast.  

# Example:

Becoming between 0800Z and 1000Z wind from  $320^{\circ}$  at 7 knots end of report  $(=)$  .  

# Area Forecasts (FA)  

The aviation area forecast (FA) gives a picture of clouds,  general weather conditions, and visual meteorological  conditions (VMC) expected over a large area encompassing  several states. There are six areas for which area forecasts  are published in the contiguous 48 states. Area forecasts are  issued three times a day and are valid for 18 hours. This type  of forecast gives information vital to en route operations as  well as forecast information for smaller airports that do not  have terminal forecasts.  

# Inflight Weather Advisories  

Inflight weather advisories are forecasts provided to en route  aircraft, and detail potentially hazardous weather. These  advisories are also available to pilots prior to departure for  flight planning purposes.  

Airman’s Meteorological Information (AIRMET) AIRMETs (report type designator WA) are issued every  6 hours with intermediate updates issued as needed for a  particular area forecast region. The information contained  in an AIRMET is of operational interest to all aircraft,  but the weather section concerns phenomena considered  potentially hazardous to light aircraft and aircraft with limited  operational capabilities. An AIRMET includes forecast of  moderate icing, moderate turbulence, sustained surface winds  of 30 knots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than  1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than 3 miles, and extensive  mountain obscurities. Each AIRMET bulletin has a fixed  alphanumeric designator, and is numbered sequentially for  easy identification, beginning with the first issuance of the  day. SIERRA is the AIRMET code used to denote IFR and  mountain obscuration; TANGO is used to denote turbulence,  strong surface winds, and low-level wind shear; and ZULU  is used to denote icing and freezing levels.  

Example:  

AIRMET TANGO UPDT 3 FOR TURBC… STG SFC  WINDS AND LLWS VALID UNTIL 242000 AIRMET TURBC… OK TX…UPDT FROM OKC TO DFW TO SAT  TO MAF TO CDS TO OKC OCNL MDT TURBC BLO 60  DUE TO STG AND GUSTY LOW LVL WINDS. CONDS  CONTG BYD 2000Z  

# Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET)  

SIGMETs (report type designator WS) are inflight advisories  concerning nonconvective weather that is potentially  hazardous to all aircraft. They report weather forecasts that  include severe icing not associated with thunderstorms,  severe or extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT)  not associated with thunderstorms, dust storms, or sandstorms  that lower surface or inflight visibilities to below 3 miles, and  volcanic ash. SIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are  valid for 4 hours, but if the SIGMET relates to hurricanes,  it is valid for 6 hours.  

A SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier, from  November through Yankee, excluding Sierra and Tango.  The first issuance of a SIGMET is designated as a UWS,  or Urgent Weather SIGMET. Re-issued SIGMETs for the  same weather phenomenon are sequentially numbered until  the weather phenomenon ends.  

Example:  

SFOR WS 100130 SIGMET ROME02 VALID UNTIL  100530 OR WA FROM SEA TO PDT TO EUG TO SEA  OCNL MOGR CAT BTN 280 AND 350 EXPCD DUE TO  JTSTR. CONDS BGNG AFT 0200Z CONTG BYD 0530Z.  

# Convective Significant Meteorological Information  (WST)  

A Convective SIGMET (WST) is an inflight weather advisory  issued for hazardous convective weather that affects the safety  of every flight. Convective SIGMETs are issued for severe  thunderstorms with surface winds greater than 50 knots, hail  at the surface greater than or equal to  $\%$   inch in diameter, or  tornadoes. They are also issued to advise pilots of embedded  thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, or thunderstorms with  heavy or greater precipitation that affect 40 percent or more  of a 3,000 square foot or greater region.  

Convective SIGMETs are issued for each area of the  contiguous 48 states but not Alaska or Hawaii. Convective  SIGMETs are issued for the eastern (E), western (W), and  central (C) United States. Each report is issued at 55 minutes  past the hour, but special reports can be issued during the  interim for any reason. Each forecast is valid for 2 hours.  They are numbered sequentially each day from 1-99,  beginning at 00 Zulu time. If no hazardous weather exists,  the Convective SIGMET will still be issued; however, it will  state “CONVECTIVE SIGMET…. NONE.”  

Example:  

MKCC WST 221855 CONVECTIVE SIGMET 21C VALID  UNTIL 2055 KS OK TX VCNTY GLD-CDS LINE NO SGFNT TSTMS RPRTD  LINE TSTMS DVLPG BY 1955Z WILL MOV EWD 30-35  KT THRU 2055Z HAIL TO 2 IN PSBL  

# Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)  

Pilot weather reports (PIREPs) provide valuable information  regarding the conditions as they actually exist in the air,  and cannot be gathered from any other source. Pilots can  confirm the height of bases and tops of clouds, locations of  wind shear and turbulence, and the location of inflight icing.  If the ceiling is below 5,000 feet, or visibility is at or below  5 miles, ATC facilities are required to solicit PIREPs from  pilots in the area. When unexpected weather conditions are  encountered, pilots are encouraged to make a report to an  FSS or ATC. When a pilot weather report is filed, the ATC  facility or FSS will add it to the distribution system to brief  other pilots and provide inflight advisories.  

PIREPs are easy to file, and a standard reporting form outlines  the manner in which they should be filed.  Figure 11-4  shows  the elements of a PIREP form. Item numbers 1 through 5 are  required information when making a report, as well as at least  one weather phenomenon encountered. PIREPs are normally  transmitted as an individual report, but may be appended to  a surface report. Pilot reports are easily decoded and most  contractions used in the reports are self-explanatory.  

Example:  

UA/OV GGG 090025/ M 1450/ FL 060/ TP C182/ SK 080  OVC/ WX FV 04R/ TA 05/ WV 270030/ TB LGT/ RM HVY RAIN

# Chapter Summary  

A thorough understanding of the weather is a “make or break”  item for the balloon pilot; without a complete picture of the  weather, a pilot may make an ill-advised decision to launch  that may result in injury, damage to the balloon, or worse.  It is imperative that a pilot use as many resources as he can,  understanding the variables potentially affecting flight, and  making an informed decision to conduct a safe flight.  

Perhaps the most valuable point to be made is that the balloon  pilot must use and exercise common sense. When flying a  balloon, the most desirable conditions are good visibility,  light winds, and no precipitation. Anything other than that  scenario should be reason to pause and consider the possible  outcome of a launch. There is never an absolute requirement  to fly—there is always the possibility of making the decision  to try again another day.  

# Chapter 5 The National  Airspace System  

# Introduction  

The National Airspace System (NAS) is the network of  all components regarding airspace in the United States.  This comprehensive label includes air navigation facilities,  equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical  charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures,  technical information, manpower, and material. Many of these  system components are shared jointly with the military. To  conform to international aviation standards, the United States  adopted the primary elements of the classification system  developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO). This chapter provides a general discussion of airspace  classification. Detailed information on the classification of  airspace, operating procedures, and restrictions is found in  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

#  

5-1 This handbook departs from the conventional norm, in that  the airspace discussions are presented in reverse order, in  the belief that it is much easier to learn the airspace from  least complicated to most complicated; also, the information  presented for basic visual flight rules (VFR) weather minimums  is only that necessary for balloon operations.  [Figure 5-1] Other information, specifically for instrument flight rules (IFR)  flying or night flight, has been omitted, as it has little or no  value to the balloon pilot. For a complete discussion of these  issues, the balloon pilot should refer to the AIM, or FAA-H- 8083-25, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  

# Airspace Classiﬁcation  

The two categories of airspace are regulatory and non- regulatory. Within these two categories, there are four types:  uncontrolled, controlled, special use, and other airspace.  Figure 5-2  presents a profile view of the dimensions of  various classes of airspace. It will be helpful to refer to this  figure as this chapter is studied, as well as remembering that  almost all sport balloon operations are conducted in Class  E or G airspace.  

# Uncontrolled Airspace  

# Class G Airspace  

Class G or uncontrolled airspace is the portion of the airspace  that has not been designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E.  Class G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the  overlying Class E airspace. Although air traffic control (ATC)  has no authority or responsibility to control air traffic within  Class G airspace, pilots should remember there are VFR  minimums which apply while operating in it. Class G airspace  is essentially uncontrolled by ATC except when associated  with a temporary control tower.  [Figures 5-2  and  5-3]  

In the eastern half of the United States, most Class G airspace  is overlaid with Class E airspace, beginning at either 700 or  1,200 feet above ground level (AGL). In the western half of  the United States, much of the Class G airspace goes up to  14,500 feet before the Class E airspace begins. The pilot is  advised to consult the appropriate sectional chart to ensure  that he or she is aware of the airspace limits prior to flight  in an unfamiliar area.  

Most balloon operations are conducted in Class G airspace.  There are no communications requirements to operate in Class  G airspace. If operations are conducted at an altitude of 1,200

feet or less AGL, the pilot must remain clear of clouds, and  there must be one statute mile of visibility. If the operations  are conducted more than 1,200 feet AGL, but less than  10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL), visibility requirements  remain at one statute mile, but cloud clearances are 1,000 feet  above, 500 feet below, and 2,000 feet horizontally from any  cloud(s). A popular mnemonic tool used to remember basic  cloud clearances is “C152,” a popular fixed-wing training  aircraft. In this case, the mnemonic recalls, “Clouds 1,000,  500, and 2,000.”  

# Controlled Airspace  

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different  classifications of airspace and defined dimensions within  which ATC service is provided in accordance with the  airspace classification. Controlled airspace consists of:  

•  Class E •  Class D •  Class C •  Class B •  Class A  

# Class E Airspace  

Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and  is controlled airspace, then it is Class E airspace. Class  E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a  designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled  airspace.  [Figures 5-2  and  5-4]  Also in this class are federal  airways and airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet  AGL used to transition to and from the terminal or en route  environment. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class  E airspace begins at   $14{,}500~\mathrm{MSL}$   over the United States,  including that airspace overlying the waters within 12  nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the 48 contiguous states  and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and  the airspace above FL 600.  

![](images/dfe5f13bb9fd35c3ea781fd879c4daf313f0f2ccc52ab4bc0f7f8227ddafea3d.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.  Class E airspace.  

There are no specific communications requirements  associated with Class E airspace; however, some Class E  airspace locations are designed to provide approaches for  instrument approaches, and a pilot would be prudent to  ensure that appropriate communications are established when  operating near those areas.  

Visibility and cloud clearances for operations conducted in  Class E airspace are similar to those of the Class G airspace.  If balloon operations are being conducted below 10,000 feet  MSL, visibility is three statute miles and the basic VFR cloud  clearance requirements of 1,000 feet above, 500 feet below,  and 2,000 feet horizontal (remember the C152 mnemonic).  Operations above 10,000 feet MSL require visibility of five  statute miles and cloud clearance of 1,000 feet above, 1,000  feet below, and one statute mile horizontally.  

# Class D Airspace  

Class D is that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet AGL  (but charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have  an operational control tower.  [Figures 5-2  and  5-5]  The  configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually  tailored. When instrument procedures are published, the  airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures.  

![](images/7f8b347cb2bf7021eac7f6a302bb14c8ce81e5c4aaf3adc2e501e03567731eff.jpg)  
Figure 5-5.  Class D airspace.  

Unless otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish  two-way radio communications with the ATC facility  providing air traffic services prior to entering the airspace  and thereafter maintain those communications while in the  airspace. Balloon pilots approaching Class D airspace should  call the ATC facility at a point where, if entry is denied, a safe  landing can still be executed. It is important to understand  that if the controller responds to the initial radio call without  using the balloon’s call sign, radio communications have not  been established, and the balloon may not enter the Class D  airspace. Many airports associated with Class D airspace do  not operate on a 24-hour-a-day basis. When not in operation,  the airspace will normally revert to Class E or G airspace,  with no communications requirements. In either case, balloon  pilots are reminded that, in the absence of an emergency  situation, there is no absolute requirement to land at the  airport associated with the Class D airspace. In most cases,  the first radio call will be made at a distance of five statute  miles from the airport.  

of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.113, a  pilot would cause less disruption by landing well short of  the airport. This is nothing more than common courtesy  and common sense. The visibility requirement for Class  D airspace is three statute miles; cloud clearances are the  standard VFR 1,000/500/2,000.  

# Class C Airspace  

Class C airspace normally extends from the surface to 4,000  feet above the airport elevation surrounding those airports  having an operational control tower, that are serviced by a  radar approach control, and with a certain number of IFR or  passenger operations.  [Figures 5-2  and  5-6]  This airspace  is charted in feet MSL, and is generally of a five NM radius  surface area that extends from the surface to 4,000 feet above  the airport elevation, and a  $10\;\bf{N M}$   radius area that extends  from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation.  There is also a noncharted outer area with a  $20\;\bf{N M}$   radius,  which extends from the surface to 4,000 feet above the  primary airport, and this area may include one or more  satellite airports.  [Figure 5-7]  

![](images/8ee2a90969119e0a5001c4eadab63ca6c58f3211ac2389834b1fd3a414a3e478.jpg)  
Figure 5-6.  Class C airspace.  

![](images/d40adbb57671a00a7e7c6ed75a6dfccd153bdec07c69e07d59e7033f06e03848.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  Example of Class C airspace on a sectional.  

Balloon pilots operating in the vicinity of an airport should  exercise discretion. While balloons indeed have the right of  way over all powered aircraft as stated in Title 14 of the Code  Balloon operations in Class C airspace, while technically  feasible, are usually not advisable. To fly an aircraft in Class  C airspace requires not only a two-way radio to establish and  maintain contact with ATC, but also an encoding transponder.  Very few balloons carry a transponder in normal operations.  As a practical matter, under certain circumstances and with  prior coordination, it is possible to enter or depart Class C  airspace without an operational transponder, but the practice  is generally discouraged. It is possible to fly in the vicinity of  a Class C airport; for example, under the lower lateral limits  of the outer layer, without needing to penetrate the inner  circle. Again, a balloon pilot is well advised to remain clear  of the controlled airspace, as a matter of common courtesy  and good public relations.  

Cloud clearances in Class C airspace are the same as Class D  airspace: visibility of three statute miles and a distance from  clouds of 1,000/500/2,000.  

# Class B Airspace  

Class B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to  10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports  in terms of airport operations.  [Figures 5-2  and  5-8]  The  configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually  tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers  (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding  cakes). An ATC clearance is required for all aircraft to  operate in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive  separation services within the airspace.  

![](images/cb79e1cecfc3772f0ca35da7742ac2319408941617291a406f2688aa7f865445.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  Class B airspace.  

As a general rule, balloons do not freely operate within Class  B airspace. Equipment requirements are the same as for Class  C airspace; however, due to air traffic congestion, the balloon  pilot requesting entry to Class B airspace will likely be denied  entry, as ballooning operations inside the Class B airspace  constitute a potential traffic conflict. Most traffic transiting  the Class B airspace is being flown under an IFR flight plan,  or, in the very least, provide a radar signature which allows  ATC to provide traffic separation. Due to their construction,  balloons do not provide a radar return much larger than a  small flock of birds (and are frequently mistaken as such).  

Should it become necessary for operational reasons to fly  through Class B airspace, that flight should be coordinated  at least one hour prior, as provided for by 14 CFR section  91.215. It is permissible, and perfectly legal, to operate  a balloon under the lateral limits of the Class B airspace.  Balloon pilots operating in the vicinity of Class B airspace  are encouraged to be familiar with the airspace, including  visual ground reference points when conducting flight under  the lateral limits to avoid inadvertently encroaching on Class  B airspace. Since aircraft operating in Class B airspace are  under radar control, there is a slight difference in the cloud  clearance requirements. Visibility remains three statute miles,  but the only cloud clearance requirement is that the pilot  remain clear of clouds.  

# Class A Airspace  

Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet  MSL up to and including FL 600, including the airspace  overlying the waters within   $12~\mathrm{{NM}}$   of the coast of the 48  contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized,  all operations in Class A airspace are conducted under IFR.  For that reason, balloons do not utilize the Class A airspace,  unless operated on a waiver or are conducting some special  operation, such as a record attempt.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special Use Airspace (or Special Area of Operation) is the  designation for airspace in which certain activities must be  confined, or where limitations may be imposed on aircraft  operations that are not part of those activities. Certain special  use airspace areas can create limitations on the mixed use of  airspace. The special use airspace depicted on sectional charts  includes the area name or number, effective altitude, time and  weather conditions of operation, the controlling agency, and  the chart panel location. On National Aeronautical Charting  Group (NACG) sectional charts, this information is available  on one of the end panels.  

Special use airspace usually consists of:  

•  Prohibited areas •  Restricted areas •  Warning areas •  Military operation areas (MOAs) •  Alert areas •  Controlled firing areas  

# Prohibited Areas  

Prohibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions  within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas  are established for security or other reasons associated with  the national welfare. These areas are published in the Federal  Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts. The area  is charted as a “P” followed by a number (e.g., “P-49”).  [Figure 5-9]  Examples of prohibited areas include Camp  David and the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where the  White House and Congressional buildings are located.  

![](images/eaf627a1b1298185a6a33b891241aac433b648b67833c1633e8cbf5ac425c63b.jpg)  
Figure 5-9.  An example of a prohibited area is Crawford, Texas.  

# Restricted Areas  

Restricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to  non participating aircraft and contain airspace within which  the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject  to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined  because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon  aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or  both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often  invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial  gunnery, or guided missiles). Penetration of restricted areas  without authorization from the using or controlling agency  may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its occupants.  ATC facilities apply the following procedures:  

1.  If the restricted area is not active and has been released  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the  ATC facility will allow the aircraft to operate in the  restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance  for it to do so. 2.  If the restricted area is active and has not been released  to the FAA, the ATC facility will issue a clearance  which will ensure the aircraft avoids the restricted  airspace.  

![](images/06fa6fa056f88309037dbe9e8ee3add9c57c1a3194c7009fdd9b3ad5e84d57d0.jpg)

Figure 5-11.   Specific information about a restricted area can be  found on the back of the sectional chart.  

# Warning Areas  

Warning areas consist of airspace which may contain hazards  to non participating aircraft in international airspace. The  activities may be much the same as those for a restricted  area. Warning areas are established beyond the three mile  limit and are depicted on aeronautical charts. Warning Areas  are also defined on the backside of the appropriate sectional  chart.  [Figure 5-11]  

Restricted areas are charted with an “R” followed by a number 

 (e.g., “R-4401”) and are depicted on the sectional charts. 

 [Figure 5-10]  Restricted area information can be obtained  on the back of the chart.  [Figure 5-11]  

# Military Operation Areas  

Military operation areas (MOA) consist of airspace of  defined vertical and lateral limits established for the purpose  of separating certain military training activity from IFR  traffic. There is no restriction against a pilot operating  VFR in these areas; however, a pilot should be alert  since training activities may include acrobatic and abrupt  maneuvers. MOAs are depicted by name and with defined  boundaries on sectional, VFR terminal area, and en route  low altitude charts and are not numbered (e.g., “Camden  Ridge MOA ”).  [Figure 5-12]  However, the MOA is also  further defined on the back of the sectional chart with times  of operation, altitudes affected, and the controlling agency.  [Figure 5-13]  

# Alert Areas  

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with  an “A” followed by a number (e.g., “A-211”) to inform  non participating pilots of areas that may contain a high  volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity.  Pilots should exercise caution in alert areas. All activity  within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with  regulations, without waiver, and pilots of participating  aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally  responsible for collision avoidance.  [Figure 5-14]  

![](images/4a5e6630c29674807e3cd1dd6aca93864662f5d4f6c08a6b417d9e98180d2a21.jpg)

Figure 5-14.  Alert area (A-211).  

# Controlled Firing Areas  

Controlled firing areas contain military activities, which,  if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be  hazardous to non participating aircraft. The difference  between controlled firing areas and other special use airspace  is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft,  radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might  be approaching the area.  

# Other Airspace Areas  

“Other airspace areas” is a general term referring to the  majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:  

•  Airport advisory areas •  Military training routes (MTR) •  Temporary flight restrictions (TFR) •  National security areas  

# Airport Advisory Areas  

An airport advisory area is an area within 10 statute miles  (SM) of an airport where a control tower is not operating,  but where a flight service station (FSS) is located. At these  locations, the FSS provides advisory service to arriving and  departing aircraft.  

# Military Training Routes (MTRs)  

Military Training Routes (MTRs) are routes used by military  aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying. These routes  are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations  at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Some route segments may  be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity.  Routes are identified as IFR (IR), and VFR (VR), followed by  a number. MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are  identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207).  MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet  AGL are identified by three number characters (e.g., IR206,  VR207). IFR Low Altitude En Route Charts depict all IR  routes and all VR routes that accommodate operations above  1,500 feet AGL. IR routes are conducted in accordance with  IFR regardless of weather conditions.  

MTR are usually indicated with a blue line on the sectional  chart. A balloon pilot flying in the area of numerous VRs or  IRs should question the briefer during the weather brief to  find out if any of the routes are in use, and a possible time  frame for opening and closing. While it is true that the balloon  pilot has the right of way, the balloon will generally come out  worse in a midair conflict with a fast-moving military aircraft.  MTRs, such as the example depicted in  Figure 5-15,  are also  further defined on the back of the sectional charts.  

![](images/c5a115b0df7738f6e387a348edb6af4093ccf52e0282f51c0c2befb0a764b45a.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  Military training routes (MTR) chart symbols.  

# Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)  

Temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) are put into effect  when traffic in the airspace would endanger or hamper air or  ground activities in the designated area. For example, a forest  fire, chemical accident, flood, or disaster-relief effort could  warrant a TFR, which would be issued as a Notice to Airmen  (NOTAM). The NOTAM begins with the phrase “FLIGHT  RESTRICTIONS” followed by the location of the temporary  restriction, effective time period, area defined in statute miles,  and altitudes affected. The NOTAM also contains the FAA  coordination facility and telephone number, the reason for the  restriction, and any other information deemed appropriate. The  pilot should check the NOTAMs as part of flight planning.  

The reasons for establishing a temporary restriction are:  

•  Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface  from an existing or imminent hazard; •  Provide a safe environment for the operation of  disaster relief aircraft; •  Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft  above an incident or event, which may generate a high  degree of public interest;  

•  Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian  reasons; •  Protect the President, Vice President, or other public  figures; and •  Provide a safe environment for space agency  operations.  

Since the events of September 11, the use of TFRs has  become much more common. There have been a number  of incidents of aircraft incursions into TFRs, which have  resulted in pilots undergoing security investigations, and  certificate suspensions. It is a pilot’s responsibility to be  aware of TFRs in their proposed area of flight. One way to  check is to visit the FAA ’s web site, at www.tfr.faa.gov, and  verify that there is not a TFR in the area.  [Figure 5-16]  

![](images/8689921b354e2904e40dff0be4bb6e4f52606f1bfcb4345e848e608de2aa9702.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.   A temporary flight restriction (TFR) imposed at  Boston’s Logan Airport to general aviation and restricting  operations at surrounding airports.  

Another TFR issue that the balloon pilot needs to be aware  of are the restrictions imposed under 14 CFR part 91, section  91.145. In this regulation, the FAA has codified restrictions  against the overflight of major outdoor events, such as the  World Series, the Rose Bowl, and NASCAR events. Several  years ago, it was relatively common to see hot air balloons  promoting products or services being flown over these events,  providing exposure for the commercial sponsor. Now, there  are significant distance and altitude restrictions for such  events, and any operations inside the TFR area must be  conducted under the provisions of a waiver. Should such an  operation be contemplated, the balloon pilot should consult  with the local Flight Service District Office (FSDO) well in  advance of the event.  

# National Security Areas  

National security areas (NSAs) consist of airspace with  defined vertical and lateral dimensions established at  locations where there is a requirement for increased security  and safety of ground facilities. Flight in NSAs may be  temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions  of 14 CFR part 99, and prohibitions will be disseminated  via NOTAM.  

# Radio Communications  

When utilizing the NAS, there are many occasions when it is  necessary to communicate with a control tower, a controlling  agency, or another aircraft. Balloon pilots should have a  working knowledge of correct radio procedures in order  to properly exercise their privileges, and not interfere with  other aviation traffic.  

Aviation very-high-frequency (VHF) radios may be used  for communications between the balloon pilot and towers,  pilot to FSS, air to air (pilot to pilot), air to ground in  some circumstances, and to get information from weather  facilities and automated stations. VHF radios are not to be  used as a “telephone service” or in a Citizen’s Band-type of  operation; this use is specifically prohibited by the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC), and may result in  monetary fines.  

There is no license requirement for a pilot operating in the  United States; however, a pilot who may be operating outside  the country is required to hold a restricted radiotelephone  permit issued by the FCC. There is also no station license  requirement for a handheld radio used in a balloon, as  it is not permanently mounted. A station license may be  required when a balloon is operated outside the country; it  is best to check with the appropriate local authorities before  contemplating such an operation.  

The single most important aspect of radio communication is  clarity. Keeping one’s transmissions brief, and using correct  terminology and phraseology when operating an aircraft  radio is imperative. All frequencies are shared with others; a  pilot’s idle chatter to a chase crew could inadvertently block  another pilot’s emergency transmission at an airfield many  miles away. A good pilot will minimize radio requirements,  and think before speaking.  

# Phonetic Alphabet  

The ICAO, of which the United States is a member, has  adopted a phonetic alphabet, which should be used in radio  communications as necessary. When communicating with  air traffic control facilities, pilots should use this alphabet  to identify their aircraft.  [Figure 5-15]  

![](images/5ae58815d4d1c314ddc8ef6ae538ea0e084f911b174ffa722b78e9959ad3c8f5.jpg)  

# Radio Procedures  

The Pilot/Controller Glossary (found in the AIM) contains  correct language for communications between a pilot at ATC  facilities. Good phraseology enhances safety and is the mark  of a conscientious pilot. Jargon, slang, and “CB” codes should  not be used in radio communications.  

A pilot should listen to the radio before transmitting. Do not  clutter the frequency with inappropriate requests or irrelevant  information. Most pilots will think before keying their radio,  and keep the transmission as brief as possible. The pilot  should be occupied with control of the balloon and should  not be spending time on the radio.  

# When Departing a Nontowered Airport  

A balloon pilot departing a nontowered airport should make  a call on the field’s UNICOM or CTAF (Common Traffic  Advisory Frequency), both of which are generally shown on  the appropriate sectional chart. The pilot should state his or  her location and intentions, as a “self-announce” advisory, so  that other air traffic in the area is aware of the operation.  

Example: “Williamson traffic, balloon 3584 Golf departing  the grass near hanger 12 to the east.”  

# When Approaching a Nontowered Airport  

If an approach to a nontowered airport is conducted, with  the intent to land, the pilot should again “self-announce” on  the appropriate UNICOM frequency or CTAF. The current  location should be stated, as well as the pilot’s intentions.  

Example: “ Air Acres traffic, balloon 3584 Golf approaching  from the west for landing at the departure end of the  runway.”  

# When Transiting a Nontowered Facility  

If flight in the vicinity of a nontowered airport is likely, with  no intent to land at the airfield, it is appropriate to let other  aircraft in the area know the intentions, particularly if there  is the possibility of interfering with the traffic pattern.  

Example: “Enterprise traffic, balloon 7510 Delta at 700 feet,  transiting from east to west along the north boundary of the  field, no landing.”  

# When Approaching Controlled Airspace  

When approaching controlled airspace, and it appears that  entry into the airspace is likely (or desired), the balloon  pilot should contact the appropriate approach control with  enough time to execute a landing, should entry be denied.  Remember that a balloon usually does not have the option  of turning around.  

![](images/684326def7381dda25489ed6fd6f71d90acabb6c4368ef8cf0867a71a77f1ad0.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.  Light gun signals.  

Example: “Huntsville Approach, balloon 903 Hotel Delta,  at 3,000.”  

The approach control facility (in this example, Huntsville  Approach) will either reply by saying, “Aircraft calling  Huntsville Approach, standby”, in which case the balloon  pilot does not have a clearance to enter the airspace; or,  approach will reply, saying “Balloon 903 Hotel Delta,  Huntsville, standby.” In this case, the aircraft call sign  was used, and the pilot may enter the airspace. Further  communication may continue until the balloon has either  landed or cleared the airspace.  

In the event that radio communication has failed, or that no  radio is available in the balloon, and continued flight into  the immediate vicinity of an towered airport facility cannot  be avoided, control towers have a “light gun” available.  This device, which looks like an oversized flare gun, allows  tower personnel to “shoot” a directed beam of light at an  approaching aircraft, and may signal field availability options  to the approaching balloon.  [Figure 5-16]  

Many balloon pilots fly for years without using a radio of any  kind. Using an aircraft radio is not a difficult task, and, with  practice, can provide a more enjoyable flight. Most ATCs  express an interest in balloons, and go out of their way to  assist balloon pilots in accomplishing their flight safely.  

# Chapter Summary  

At first glance, the NAS appears to be a complex arena  in which to operate such a simple aircraft. This chapter  simplifies the airspace to the reader, and makes it readily  apparent that it is possible to operate a hot air balloon safely,  without causing conflict.  

Simple courtesy and common sense goes a long way in  airspace operations. A complete and thorough understanding  of the airspace, combined with good decision-making, will  allow the pilot to do what he or she wishes, with recognition  of the needs of other users of the sky.  

# Chapter 6 Layout To Launch  

# Introduction  

This chapter introduces inflation and launch of the balloon.  It also provides useful information on checklists, crew and  crew management, false lift, and landowner relations.  

# Preﬂight Operations  

The preflight, as an aeronautical term, is generally agreed  to be the airworthiness check of an aircraft immediately  before flight. In the broadest sense, preflight is everything  accomplished in preparation for a flight. In this chapter,  preflight operations occur at the balloon launch site, up to  and including the preflight inspection.  

# Checklists  

The value of using a checklist is well known to the airlines and  the military. Regulations require air carrier pilots and military  pilots to use checklists. Also, Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) practical tests require pilot certificate applicants to  use checklists. Checklists are effective and contribute to safe  flying because routine and familiarity breed complacency.  Like military and airline pilots, balloonists who fly every day  need a checklist to ensure nothing is omitted. For example,  professional balloon ride operators are subject to distractions  and interruptions during their preflight, layout, assembly, and  inspection. Infrequent balloon flyers, which include most  balloonists, need checklists because long periods of inactivity  create memory lapses. A typical balloonist may make only  25 to 30 flights per year or less. A checklist does not replace  proficiency, but it helps.  [Figure 6-1]  

![](images/07c90f6348f57a680e37269079437c34f0b3bc17d38d382734b88915924fbeff.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.   Using a checklist.  

A checklist can also save time. By arranging the layout,  assembly, and inspection in a logical order, and accomplishing  more than one task at a time, duplication and wasted time  is minimized. For instance, a properly arranged preflight  checklist includes many tasks that are performed while the  fan is running, so people are not just standing around waiting  for the envelope to inflate. Also, a checklist eliminates  needless walking. Students and new pilots need checklists  because they are forming habit patterns, and need prompting  to reinforce training and confirm good habits.  

There are two theories regarding checklists. One popular  procedure is the “call-and-response” method. One person  reads the checklist, and the pilot responds that the item is  in the proper configuration. This is rather time consuming,  and probably not appropriate for ballooning activities. At the  other extreme are large groupings of components and items  to check with a casual glance to confirm that those items look  correct. Perhaps the best methodology suited for ballooning  is smaller groupings (i.e., basket, burner and fuel system,  instruments, envelope security) and using the checklist as  an outline to ensure that each item is checked. It may be  appropriate to create a habit pattern of physically touching  particular items to ensure security and proper operation.  Pilots are cautioned that a checklist is not necessarily a “to- do” list. Flight training should emphasize proper procedures  and habits, with a checklist used to confirm that tasks have  been completed.  

# Preflight Inspection Checklist  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) and the  practical test standards (PTS) for balloon pilot certification  require the pilot to inspect the balloon by systematically  utilizing an appropriate checklist prior to each flight. Most  balloon manufacturers include a preflight inspection checklist  in the flight manual. This may be used as the basis for a  personalized preflight checklist. Each balloon manufacturer  lists maximum allowable damage with which a balloon may  fly and still be considered airworthy. Balloon pilots should  be familiar with the manufacturer’s maximum allowable  damage rules for their balloon and abide by them.  

Using a written checklist, the pilot should make certain that  the balloon is correctly laid out for inflation, all control  lines are attached, the fuel system is operating correctly,  maximum allowable damage limits are not exceeded, and all  components are ready for flight. The pilot is responsible for  all aspects of flight, including preflight operations.  

The best checklist is one each pilot develops for his or her  individual balloon. A good source for checklist items is the  manufacturer of the balloon. Also, checklists from other  pilots and manufacturers may be incorporated into a personal  checklist. Remember, a checklist is a living document that  changes when modifications or additions are appropriate.  

# Emergency Checklist  

Carefully study and memorize emergency checklists. Do  not try to read a checklist during an emergency; that is  for an aircraft with two- or three-person crews and at high  altitude. During an emergency, take prompt action to resolve  the problem, and when the situation permits, refer to the  balloon’s flight manual to ensure all necessary items have  been accomplished. The single most important action in an  emergency is to continue to fly the balloon and regain control  of the situation. Appendix C contains sample checklists that  may be used or modified to meet specific requirements for  a particular balloon system or flight operation.  

# Weather Brief  

As previously discussed, a weather brief must be obtained  prior to flight; as a procedural matter, the information from  the briefing sets the parameters for the flight (launch site,  flight track, and potential landing areas).  

All electronic sites and briefings represent the starting point  for how weather affects the flight. A balloon pilot should  not  make the mistake of gathering weather data, getting  a forecast, deciding to fly, and then paying less attention  to actual weather cues. Weather monitoring is an ongoing  process that starts on the drive to the launch field and  continues until the balloon is packed after landing. Continue  gathering weather data for the flight until safely back on the  ground.  

Despite using the most current and complete electronic  weather data available to consider before driving out for  the flight, each pilot must never lose sight of the fact that  hot air balloons are visual flight rules (VFR) aircraft. Many  pilots lose all access to unlimited or even selected electronic  weather information en route to or at the launch site. Unless  the launch site is a reporting station for any weather service,  a pilot is required to visually interpret and evaluate weather  data specific to the launch site. Local surface conditions— particularly winds below   $500{-}800^{\circ}$  —show the greatest  variability of both speed and direction. These winds are  perhaps of greatest importance in determining the conditions  and risks for launch and landing. A number of simple  observations enable the balloon pilot to gather this data at the  launch site, as well as during the flight.  [Figure 6-2]  

![](images/c5b20e8236dc0e4e5d687f2ebc30968cf82e476087c7e06959549e54f5c6f520.jpg)  

The balloon can sometimes provide valuable weather  information provided the pilot knows what to look for. Fabrics  on a laid-out envelope begin rippling around eight miles per  hour (mph), while 10–12 mph sends small bubbles of air past  a closed throat and up along the load tapes. Such information,  perhaps unavailable or inaccurate elsewhere, can prove  invaluable, especially during the initial phase of flight.  

Each pilot must sharpen his or her ability to read and interpret  local surface conditions for one primary reason: up to 1  hour may elapse between gathering weather data online and  laying out at the launch site. Weather patterns can change  in far less time than this, and local conditions can change  almost instantly.  

Some pilots choose to rely on a portable weather station  or handheld wind meter to monitor local conditions at the  launch site. Cost, size, portability, and features vary among  brands, but each can provide useful information on wind  speed/direction, maximum gusts, and other weather data.  These can range from a small   $\S100$   handheld wind meter  to a  $\S500$   weather station with  $15"$   mast and dashboard data  display.  [Figure 6-3]  

![](images/40e2d50ac899cf5147274296d40a2081f208c262202fc56f3939d8f1e9c45a06.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.  Checking wind velocity with a handheld wind meter.  

Perhaps the cheapest yet most valuable launch site weather  aid is the pibal or pilot balloon, a   $\scriptstyle10-14"$   helium-filled  balloon released at the launch site for visual weather cues  and forecast confirmation. Some pibal actions clearly mean  cancel the flight: rolling along the ground, not clearing  obstacles, climbing then diving, or dramatic speed/direction  changes (which indicate wind shears). To read and confirm  winds at different altitudes, release several pibals at 10–20  second intervals. Fill the first with 100 percent helium, the  second with mostly helium and a breath of air from your  mouth, and the third with helium and two breaths. This  creates different rates of ascent which helps gain a better  perspective of the low level winds. Every pilot benefits from  having pibals in their vehicle and using them before launch.  Appendix D lists various rates of climb for different sizes  of pibals; using this knowledge, the pilot can determine the  altitudes at which the winds change.  

Every pilot and crewmember can build a mental database of  visual cues that report weather data. More important than pre- launch weather is inflight weather, which is further removed  in time from forecast conditions (electronic or briefings)  but can change just as fast and dramatically. Wind speed  or direction changes can signal developing rain or frontal  movement. Radar returns require human interpretation and  can miss developing conditions or provide false echoes off  birds or buildings. Weather-savvy pilots and crew gather  weather information from whatever source is available to  them anywhere, at any time.  

# Performance Planning/Fuel Planning  

The good balloon pilot checks the balloon’s performance  charts, considering that day’s conditions, and comes to a  reasonable conclusion regarding the limitations of the balloon  for that particular flight. Prior to flight (and perhaps even prior  to layout), fuel gauges should be checked to ensure there is  sufficient fuel on board to conduct the planned flight.  

# The Chase Crew  

Generally, there are two different areas of responsibility for  a crew: inflation/launch and chase/recovery. Both are usually  referred to as ground crew. Passengers often serve as inflation  crew, become passengers for the flight, and crew again after  the balloon has landed. Before the noise and activity make  discussion difficult, the pilot should give the crew briefing  and discuss any requirements before inflation.  

# Number of Crewmembers  

The number of crewmembers is a matter of individual  preference and depends upon the size of the balloon, purpose  of the flight, terrain, and other factors. When using a small  balloon for instruction, a crew of three people, including  the instructor, student, and one crew, may be sufficient.  For passenger flights in large balloons, a larger number  of crewmembers are generally required. Having too many  people in the chase vehicle may be a distraction for the driver.  The recommended minimum crew for the vehicle is two:  one person to drive and the other to navigate and serve as a  balloon “spotter.” This is perhaps the safest method.  

The optimum size inflation crew for a sport balloon is four  people—the pilot operating the burner, two people holding the  mouth open, and one person on the crown line. Some pilots opt  to have a fifth person serve as a fan operator; this is a matter  of technique and personal preference. Many pilots prefer a  larger number of crewmembers; however, it is important to  be aware that too many crewmembers may often be working  against each other due to lack of coordination. In windy or  crowded situations, it is important to have a person holding  the crown line. If inflation requires more crew than usual,  due to the windy conditions, consideration should be given to  canceling the flight. Although the balloon may get airborne,  chances are that flying out of one’s comfort zone and having  to prepare for a very windy landing may impair concentration.  The distraction may hinder safe, enjoyable flying.  

# Clothing  

Crewmembers, as well as the pilot, should be clothed for safety  and comfort. Cover or restrain long hair. Scarves, hanging  jewelry, or loose eyeglasses can interfere with smooth setup,  and can potentially be very dangerous, particularly near the  inflation fan. Long sleeves and long trousers made of cotton  instead of synthetic material are recommended. Try to wear  clothes in layers since temperatures can change quite a bit  from before sunrise to the recovery. Proper clothing protects  participants from burns, poison oak/ivy, and other harmful  plants.  

All crewmembers should wear gloves, preferably smooth  leather, loose fitting, and easy to remove. Wear comfortable  and protective footwear. If it becomes necessary to walk or  hike from a landing site inaccessible by the chase vehicle,  proper clothing and footwear make the task easier and less  hazardous.  

# Types of Flight  

Knowing the function or purpose of a flight is important to  the crew, so they know the goals of the operation; possible  time aloft; probable direction(s) of flight; probable altitudes;  communications, if any, to be used; and useful maps or  charts. Balloon flights can be classified into several different  types: paid passenger, instruction, race, rally, advertising/ promotion, and fun.  

Many commercial balloon pilots defray the cost of the sport  by offering paid passenger rides. The crew should know  that these passengers are paying for the privilege, and may  have been promised a certain type and length of flight.  Instructional flights require the crew follow the direction  of the instructor, so the student may see and participate as  much as possible. The crew should work closely with the  instructor and student and not take over any portion of the  operation, thus denying the student the opportunity to learn.  For competitions, crew responsibilities may be different.  The pilot may have only a single goal in mind and focus  on that goal. The crew’s job is always to help the pilot, but  in the case of the competition flight, the crew should try to  relieve the pilot of some of the routine tasks so he or she may  concentrate on the goals. Regardless of the type of flight, the  crew is there to support the pilot in conducting a safe and  successful flight operation.  

# Direction of Flight  

The first element of the flight the chase crew must know is the  direction the balloon is going. It is important to understand  that the balloon’s direction is very difficult to detect from  a moving vehicle. Many pilots recommend the chase crew  drive the chase vehicle away from the launch site only far  enough to get the vehicle out of the way of the balloon (and  other balloons) and to be clear of any possible spectator  crowds. As soon as the crew is sure they are clear of other  traffic, they should park in a suitable place with a good view  of the balloon, and determine the balloon’s direction of  flight. There is no point in rushing after the balloon until the  direction it is going is known. The balloon changes direction  shortly after launch if the winds aloft are different from the  surface winds.  

After a while, the crew should proceed to a point estimated  to be in the balloon’s path. In other words, get in front of  the balloon so it flies over the chase vehicle. If the balloon is  moving at five knots, the chase crew need drive only a short  time to get in front of the balloon. The direction of flight is  much easier to determine if the balloon is floating directly  toward the vehicle rather than flying parallel to the vehicle’s  path. If a radio is not being used, as the balloon flies over  the chase vehicle, the pilot and crew can communicate by  voice or with hand signals. In this instance, the crew should  be outside the vehicle with the engine turned off.  

# The Crew Brieﬁng  

Crew briefings vary from a few last minute instructions (to  an experienced, regular crew), or a long, detailed discourse  on how to layout, assemble, inflate, chase, recover, and pack  a balloon.  [Figure 6-4]  A pilot can give crew briefings by  telephone the night before, or in the chase vehicle on the  way to the launch site, but most crew briefings are done at  the launch site prior to the flight. It is important for the pilot  to remember who is ultimately responsible for the entire  

![](images/5ba5e8222a78bcb77b83a7811692895f870f4dd18b0504f4d86eeb90eea5ee85.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Crew briefing.  

operation and that the crew is the pilot’s representative on  the ground.  

Whether this is the crewmembers’ first time or one-hundredth  time crewing, they should be briefed before each flight.  Instructions contained in the briefing may be less detailed  for an experienced crew. The following instructions should  be given for each flight:  

•   Estimated length of flight and any information that  aids the chase and recovery •   Anticipated direction of flight •   Position and duties during inflation •   Duties once the balloon has reached equilibrium  

A typical flight briefing may be “I intend to make a 1 hour  flight and I have about 2 hours of fuel on board. From  my weather briefing and the pibal, I should travel in a  southeasterly direction; but if I go west, I will land before  getting to the freeway. I will probably do a lot of contour  flying, but may go up to 2,000 feet to look around. Let’s  use channel six on the radio. There is a county road map on  the front seat.”  

“Patricia, you will be the crew chief for today’s flight, as  well as the driver. The keys to the van are in the ignition,  and there is a spare set in the console. I would like you and  Bob to do the mouth this morning. Bob, you will be on the  side away from the fan. Pat will show you what needs to be  done, and I will double check you during the inflation. You  will also be navigating, so we will have a look at the map  together in a minute. Susan, you will be on the fan. Be sure  to keep people away from the plane of the fan, and please do  not move the fan while it is running. Leslie, you are on the  crown line today. You have done it before, so I know that  you know the procedures, but as a reminder, do not wrap any  lines around your hand, arm, or body. I will check with you  a couple of times during the inflation to make sure you are  positioned properly.”  

“ Any questions? Good. Sleeves down, gloves on, and let’s  go!”  

# The Crown Line  

The duty of the crown line crewmember is to hold the end of  the line, lean away from the envelope, and use body weight to  stabilize the envelope. As the air is heated and the envelope  starts to rise, the crewmember holding the crown line should  allow the line to pull him or her towards the basket, putting  only enough resistance on the line to keep the envelope from  swaying or moving too fast. Release the tension slowly after  the envelope is vertical.  [Figure 6-5]  

![](images/904a165ed4c34c47e87604830c0c150b111bd951b5b0b402e799afe456a24924.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.   Crew can often stabilize a rolling envelope by taking a  Figure 6-6.   Double crown lines forming a  $90^{\circ}$   or wider angle offer  single crown line  $45^{\circ}$   off of downwind and walking directly upwind  the greatest inflation stability provided crew walk them directly  on stand-up. upwind on stand-up.  

The crown line varies in length. Some pilots let the line  hang straight down; some pilots connect the end of the line  to the basket or burner frame. Other pilots keep the line only  long enough to assist with a windy inflation, or deflation in  a confined area. Usually, there are no knots in the crown  line, but you might find a type of loop attached to it. Some  pilots put knots in their line, or attach flags or other objects.  These may snag in trees and cause problems. Lines tied to  the basket form a huge loop that may snag a tree limb and  should be secured with a light, breakaway tie.  

To improve control, some pilots use a double crown line  during very windy conditions. This technique, as shown in  Figure 6-6,  allows for better control of the envelope when  winds may be gusting, but still within reasonable flight limits,  as may be present in an afternoon launch. Many pilots launch  in afternoon winds, knowing that winds generally decrease  significantly as sunset approaches. One advantage of this  technique is that the balloon can be kept stable in fairly gusty  winds, even if held on the ground for an extended period of  time. This may be helpful for the pilot who may be doing  a static (non-flying) tether, or perhaps during an evening  “balloon glow” when winds may remain gusty until well  after sunset.  

# Launch Site  

When selecting a launch site, factors to consider are obstacles  in direction of flight (powerlines, buildings, towers, etc.),  available landing sites, and the launch site surface.  

# Location and Obstacles  

The launch site is selected based on surface winds and  winds aloft, in conjunction with the desires of the balloon  pilot. Consideration is given to what type of flight is being  made and to the overall goal of the flight. Upon arriving at  a particular launch site, most pilots release another pibal to  verify the wind direction, and ensure that the forecasts or  earlier readings have not changed significantly.  

Ideally, the launch site should be a large, open grassy area.  Obstacles in the flight path are a consideration. As a general  rule, the balloon should be placed as far as possible upwind  of any obstructions to flight (powerlines, trees, buildings,  etc.), using a minimum of 100 feet of clearance for each knot  of wind.  [Figure 6-7]  

![](images/cb3821ec4c6363169b665d0e41be0f5d5c204f6b1005ce45c92edb9e33d160bb.jpg)  
Figure 6-7.   Examples of good (top) and poor (bottom) launch sites. In the top picture, the pilot would have adequate clearance above  the power lines at the far end of the field, as well as more than adequate area to layout the envelope.  In the bottom picture, the pilot  would have a very short area to lay out. There are obvious obstacles, such as the trees and cell phone tower, which create hazards to a  safe launch.  

# Landing Sites  

The best launch site is of little use if there are no appropriate  landing sites downwind. Many pilots examine their flight path  from the perspective of the landing area, particularly in an  area of few landing fields, and “reverse plan” their launch  site in order to make the appropriate choice of launch sites.  Occassionally, this may require using a launch site that may  be somewhat less than desirable. As long as the launch can  be made safely, with appropriate obstacle clearance, this is  perfectly acceptable.  

# Launch Site Surface  

After determining the flight direction, the next condition  that determines the details of the balloon layout is the actual  launch site surface. Of course, all pilots want to lay out their  balloon on clean, dry, short, green grass. Most pilots are not  that fortunate unless they have their own launch site and never  fly from different places. Wise pilots modify their techniques  according to available conditions, or they have more than one  layout procedure to adapt to various launch sites.  

Whether flying from a regular launch site, a brand new  location, or from an assigned square at a rally, check the  ground for items that may damage or soil the balloon. Look  for and remove nails, sharp rocks, twigs, branches, and other  foreign objects. If there are patches of oil or other substances,  cover them with pieces of carpet, floor mats from the chase  vehicle, tarps, or the envelope bag. Some pilots cover the  ground where they lay out their balloon with a large tarp  every time they fly.  

Unless flying at a known site, do not assume it is all right to  drive the chase vehicle directly onto the launch area. There  are some locations (a soft athletic field, for example) where  it is necessary to carry the balloon onto the launch area. If  using private property, it is necessary to get permission to  use the property for flight activities. This may be the first  experience with landowner relations, and the considerate  pilot takes action to minimize his or her impact on the  landowner’s property. Landowner relations are an important  part of ballooning, and are discussed in greater detail later  in this chapter.  

# Balloon Placement and Wind Direction  

Consider the wind direction before the balloon is unloaded  from the chase vehicle. Take into account the surface wind at  the time of cold inflation to avoid carrying a heavy balloon  bag and basket around. A “Murphy’s Law” type of rule is that  the wind always changes during inflation. Local knowledge  is invaluable. If other balloons are around, check with the  most experienced local pilot.  

A wind change at or shortly after sunrise is normal in many  places. If the balloon is laid out prior to sunrise, a wind change  is likely. If flying in a new area, it is beneficial to watch the  local pilots, as they have knowledge of local conditions and  idiosyncrasies. Some general trends are that air usually flows  downhill or down valley first thing in the morning, and air  usually flows from cold to warm in the morning. The air  drainage may stop very shortly after the sun rises and starts  heating the ground. The early morning wind may come from  a different direction than the prevailing or predicted wind.  Some local pilots may lay their balloons out in a direction  that does not match the airflow at the time, but that corrects  15 to 30 minutes later when the sunrise change occurs and  the inflation starts.  

# Removing the Balloon from the Vehicle  

Once the specific location on the launch field has been  determined, the balloon should be removed from the  vehicle, or unloaded from its trailer, and prepared for flight.  [Figure 6-8]  Good procedures and habit patterns formed here  minimize the amount of lifting of balloon components, and  reduces the wear and tear on the crew and the pilot, as well as  the equipment itself. Despite being a lighter-than-air aircraft,  the packed balloon and basket are heavy; the average sport  balloon system can weigh over 550 pounds.  

![](images/182324df123670983a48e47b494b8b4a0df3a0c9637b6544d2edad0dc7c5e0db.jpg)  
Figure 6-8.   Unloading the basket and moving the vehicle forward  minimizes equipment carrying.  

One method is for the pilot to establish the specific location  and direction of layout, and direct that the basket be placed  there. The transport vehicle maneuvers to allow the basket  to be removed and placed at the pilot’s discretion, and then  pulls forward about 15 or 20 feet to allow for the envelope bag  and inflator fan to be removed and placed on the ground. The  vehicle may then be removed from the launch site, or moved  to the back of the basket to serve as a tie-off point for the  balloon’s quick-release system. This method minimizes the  amount of lifting and carrying of heavy components. When  used in reverse, it allows for the system to be packed up at  the end of the flight, and kept ready for a future flight.  

# Assembly  

If the basket is disassembled for transport and handling, it  must be assembled in accordance with the flight manual prior  to layout. The pilot, using the checklist, should either perform  these functions or carefully supervise them.  

# Basket  

Once the basket is appropriately placed, it is necessary to  attach the uprights and burner frame (as appropriate). Each  brand of balloon is slightly different, and the balloon’s flight  manual should be checked for the specific procedures. Some  balloon baskets must be placed on their side to install the  uprights and burner, while some may be left standing upright.  Either way, after the components are installed, they should  be checked for installation, integrity, security, and general  condition.  

# Burner and Fuel System  

If not accomplished in the previous step, the burner(s) (or  heater) should be mounted and connected. Retaining pins,  as applicable, must be mounted, and fuel lines connected  between the burner and the tanks. The practice of using  an adjustable wrench on fuel line fittings is discouraged;  while convenient, these wrenches usually cause excessive  wear on the fittings over time, and may result in damage or  early replacement. It is usually better to use the correct size  open-end wrench. Fittings do not need to be heavily torqued  into place; this is a common error with newer pilots. A good  fitting usually seals with little more than finger-tight force.  Anything more may indicate corrosion or a damaged flange  seal in the fitting.  [Figure 6-9]  

It is appropriate to check for leaks in the fuel system at this  point; this should be a checklist item. The pilot opens the  fuel tank valves and checks each connection, at both tank and  burner, by using a “sniff test.” The odorant in propane, ethyl  mercaptan, has a very distinctive odor and is relatively easy  to detect. The burner should also be examined to ensure that  no fuel is leaking from fittings, pressure gauges, or interior  plumbing. Once satisfied that there are no leaks, the fuel may  be turned off and the pressure bled off. The basket should  then be placed in a vertical position to prepare for the next  function check.  

# Burner Check  

Most manufacturers require burner checks as a necessary  part of an equipment function check and are indicative of  

![](images/31dd9faa7387c896109bdcbe69ac5776d58b6ba6a4093aa7f0df5655eb8b85f0.jpg)  
Figure 6-9.  Burner installation on a Lindstrand.  

good habit patterns. Each system has a specific procedure,  appropriate to that particular system, which is outlined in  the flight manual for that model of balloon. In general, each  burner, including the pilot light, is checked individually  for correct operation to ensure that the burner is working  properly. Each burner is checked using each fuel tank, and all  backup systems should also be checked for correct function  and operation.  

As an example, assume a single burner balloon with three  tanks connected into a common fuel line (tanks in parallel).  The pilot would first light the pilot lights and check for  correct operation. Then, one tank would be opened, and the  blast valve activated. The pilot checks for correct operation,  smooth blast valve movement, and for pressure in the fuel  system, as excessive loss of pressure may be indicative of a  fuel tank or line problem. This procedure should be repeated  for each tank, closing off the first tank when moving to the  second, and so on. After all tanks are checked, then the  backup system (Fire2 ™ , Whispervalve ™ , Liquid Fire ™ ,  Metering Valve, etc.) should also be tested. Once all systems  are checked for functionality, then the tanks should be closed,  pressure released from the fuel system by burning off the fuel,  and the basket placed on its side in preparation for attaching  the envelope. (NOTE: At no time should all of the tanks in  a parallel-plumbed system be opened at once. In the event  of a fuel leak or ruptured hose, there are three or more tanks  feeding the leak. This is an extremely hazardous practice.)  

Pilots should also note that there is a growing trend towards  the use of inflation, or “pony” tanks, used to supplement on- board fuel for inflation.  Use of an inflation tank allows the  pilot to launch with completely full tanks, as the additional  tank is either temporarily plumbed into the balloon’s fuel  system by the use of a quick-disconnect fitting, or hoses  are switched around at the burner fitting.  There is no  manufacturer’s written procedure available for the use of an  inflation tank, and the procedure is strongly discouraged.  Of  perhaps greater concern is the mindset that the one or two  gallon advantage this gives the pilot,  is of greater concern  than the safety aspect of the procedure. If a pilot consistently  requires these one or two gallons of fuel to safely conduct  a flight, then there are possibly other performance planning  factors being neglected.  

Most pilots conduct a burner check at the beginning of each  flight. Others, if conducting multiple flights over a relatively  short period of time (a weekend balloon rally, for example),  may do a full burner check for the first flight only, and then  only check for leaks on each remaining flight. This practice,  while common, may violate the manufacturer’s operations  manual and invites problems; it is best avoided.  

# Instrument Checks  

It is appropriate to check the instruments at this point.  Virtually all instrument systems currently in use require  battery power; it is wise to check the instruments, and  ensure that the batteries provide sufficient power to operate  them. There is nothing more frustrating than being ready to  fly and finding that the instruments do not work. After the  instruments are checked for operation, they may be mounted  in the basket. Some pilots choose to set the altimeter at this  time; the barometric pressure should be set according to the  information gathered during the weather briefing. In the  absence of a barometric pressure setting, the altimeter should  be set to the appropriate field elevation. The only time that  the altimeter may be set to zero is when the balloon is being  flown from an ocean beach; 14 CFR part 91, section 91.121  provides clarification on this requirement. This is necessary  to avoid airspace issues.  [Figure 6-10]  

At this point, the basket is on its side with the instruments  mounted and ready for the envelope to be attached. The  pilot and crew should open the envelope bag, remove the  suspension cables and attachment hardware (carabiners,  “A-blocks,” or toggles), and attach the bottom of the  envelope to the basket superstructure in accordance with the  manufacturer’s instructions. Care should be taken that cables  are not twisted and are free of damage, kinks, loose wires,  

![](images/e2809df706289548c5d2da95ffc8ccdbfdc5546d6d0730b0f520a53683460715.jpg)

or missing sheathing (found on Kevlar  $\cdot@$   suspension cables).  Once the envelope is attached, the hardware should be  checked for security and the envelope laid out for inflation.  

# Layout  

There are many variations of laying out a balloon and  preparing it for inflation. The manufacturer of the balloon or  the way the balloon is assembled sets some of these inflation  styles. The launch site surface, the order in which the balloon  is assembled, and how the balloon is removed from the chase  vehicle have a bearing on the way the preflight layout and  inspection proceeds. There is no one best way to lay out  a balloon, as there is no one best way to inflate a balloon.  The two most common ways to prepare the balloon for cold  inflation are to spread it out or inflate from a long strip.  

The pilot should be mindful of current conditions prior to  removing the envelope from its bag. It is wise to take a  moment and walk around the launch site to check the surface  for any debris that may damage the balloon.  

As a cautionary note, do not drag the envelope bag along the  ground when pulling the envelope out. Many envelopes have  holes and tears caused by being dragged over sharp objects  while getting the envelope out of the bag. Lift the bag clear  of the ground and carry it unless the launch surface is perfect  with no sharp objects or dirty spots.  

# Spread Layout  

The spread layout method for inflation is the most widely  used method. By handling the envelope with the load tapes,  the fabric is pulled away from the center until the envelope  takes its normal shape while still flat on the ground. Exercise  care when sliding the fabric across the ground to avoid  causing damage.  

All balloons have an even number of load tapes. By using the  number on the load tape when spreading the envelope, the  envelope can be arranged in a proper position for inflation.  With one crewmember on each side of the envelope fabric,  start at the mouth and travel the length of the appropriate load  tape, pulling the fabric taut up to the equator. This allows the  bottom to be laid out flat. Be careful to handle only the load  tapes when positioning the envelope because pulling on the  fabric could cause damage. Holding a load tape and flapping  up and down gently helps avoid tears and other damage while  spreading the envelope. This action traps a small bubble of air  which floats, rather than drags fabric and keeps the balloon  cleaner and easier to pull.  [Figure 6-11]

Figure 6-11.  A spread layout.  

Check the deflation system at this time and properly position  it in accordance with the balloon flight manual. While the  envelope is filling with air, the crew can assist the process  by lifting upward on the load tapes, allowing more cold air to  pack the envelope. This method allows the envelope to deploy  smoothly and easily, even with a small inflation fan.  

# Strip Layout  

When inflating on pavement or a small or narrow launch site,  many pilots prefer not to deploy the envelope on the ground.  Instead, they prefer to pull the envelope straight out from  the basket, making sure the top gore is on top its full length,  and to inflate the envelope entirely with the fan. This may  require a larger fan, depending on the size of the balloon and  envelope material.  [Figure 6-12]  

Once the balloon is stretched out, ensure the control lines  (deflation, cooling, or rotating) are correctly attached to the  

![](images/901851ecf000e8e09a10be33094a82bf31721e50d5c442cae9df2d37dbb6d398.jpg)  

# Figure 6-12.  A strip layout.  

basket according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This  method minimizes handling the fabric on a rough or dirty  surface. It requires more diligence by the ground crew to  ensure it deploys correctly.  

# Progressive Fill  

Inflation out of the bag is a coordinated technique in which  the envelope is cold inflated directly out of the bag. With  the envelope suspension connected to the basket, it is pulled  progressively out of the bag as the fan is running, inflating  the envelope as the crew slowly, with pauses, carries the  balloon bag away from the basket while the envelope fills.  Another variation, the progressive fill, has the crew holding  the envelope in their arms, gradually releasing more and more  of the envelope, from mouth to top, until the very top of the  envelope is released for filling. The progressive fill packs the  lower portion of the envelope with cold air, and exposes less  of the fabric to the ground. This method generally results in  a faster inflation, but may create problems with attaching a  parachute top or ensuring that lines are not tangled.  

# Inﬂator Fan Placement  

The type of inflator fan needed for different layout techniques  depends primarily on the amount of work required. The  strip layout method requires a large, strong fan to force the  envelope into shape, while the spread layout method requires  less fan energy.  

Fan placement and techniques are as varied as the pilots who  fly. It may appear that every pilot has a slightly different  technique for placement and use of the fan, but the general  principle is the same. The fan should be placed to the side of  the basket  [Figure 6-13],  with the air flow directed into the  mouth of the balloon to inflate the envelope, but far enough  

![](images/5baffdc0522a1ee3eaba5145d65094776cde50ce02ca7f529b79ed88228ddce9.jpg)

back to allow the airflow to “seal” the throat. This allows  the most efficient use of the fan.  

A method pilots use to determine the best placement of the  fan is to attach small pieces of fabric or surveying tape on  the lower portion of the mouth, using safety pins in such a  manner as to not create damage or holes. Then, the crew holds  the mouth of the balloon open with the fan running; if all  pieces of the tape are pointing into the envelope, then the fan  is properly placed; however, if any of the tapes are fluttering  back out the mouth of the envelope, this demonstrates that the  airflow is going into the envelope and coming back out again.  This does not allow for a good inflation, and the fan should  be adjusted to correct this deficiency. This demonstration  

![](images/aae54a1b7a73253b14f90423ae529b0c837849eee342e641cdfe28d73545064b.jpg)  
Figure 6-14.   Determining correct inflation fan placement. Note that  the strips of tape are generally pointing into the mouth. In this case,  the pilot would do well to incline the fan slightly towards the right  side of the mouth, in order to better “seal” the envelope opening,  and get a more efficient inflation.  

should be done without use of the burner, as the pilot may  inadvertently cause damage or start a fire.  [Figure 6-14]  

It is generally better to pack the balloon full of cold air. This  makes a tighter mouth, which avoids burning fabric, and  the balloon may be less affected by a light wind when it is  round and tight.  

# Safety Restraint/Quick-Release  

The quick-release or safety restraint should be secured, with  little or no slack in the line, to prevent possible damage or  injury in the event of a break or premature release. Every  major balloon manufacturer specifies the approved method  for tying off. Balloon baskets, suspensions, load plates, and  burner supports have been destroyed by improper tie-off in  light winds. When tying down for inflation, reference the  balloon’s flight manual for the recommended procedures and  techniques. The use of a safety restraint is a recommended  procedure for enhanced safety.  

# Passenger Brieﬁng  

Prior to inflation, a pilot should give passengers their first  briefing for behavior during the flight and landing. Inform  passengers that during the landing they should stand in the  rear of the basket where shown by the pilot (based on wind  conditions), facing the direction of flight, with feet and knees  together, knees slightly bent, and holding tightly to the sides  of the basket. They are not to exit the basket until instructed  by the pilot to do so. This procedure allows the passengers  to see the landing sequence, and is generally accepted  throughout the ballooning community. In larger balloons,  which usually have compartmentalized baskets, some pilots  encourage the passengers to face away from the direction of  flight. Either procedure is acceptable, as long as it is briefed  prior to flight, and reinforced prior to landing.  

The balloon is ready for inflation when the preflight  preparation is complete. Excess equipment is stowed in the  basket and chase vehicle, and a radio check is completed.  

# Inﬂation  

The inflation procedure takes the balloon envelope from a pile  of fabric to an aircraft capable of lifting a load. The pilot’s  goal should be a smooth, controlled inflation that does not  damage the environment, balloon, or harm the crew. At the  end of the inflation, the balloon should be upright, close to  equilibrium, and ready to fly.  

# Inﬂation Styles  

There are many different styles of inflation. Some pilots use  one or two large fans to inflate the balloon fast and get it tight.  Some pilots prefer to fill the envelope slowly to give them  time for preflight preparation. Some use many crewmembers;  

some use only a few crewmembers. Balloon size, available  crew, weather, location, and personal preference are factors  that determine procedures and number of crewmembers.  

# The Inﬂation  

After the balloon is correctly laid out, place the inflation  fan to the side of the basket within arm’s reach of the pilot,  facing into the center of the envelope mouth, making sure the  fan blades are not in line with the pilot, crew, or spectators.  If the fan is well designed and maintained, it will not move  around or require constant attention during operation. Exact  fan placement depends on the type of fan, burner, and size  of the envelope, as previously discussed. Pump air into the  envelope and not under, over, or to the side of the mouth.  

A crewmember should be placed at each side of the mouth of  the balloon to lift the material and create an opening for air  to enter the envelope. During cold inflation (i.e., with the fan  only) hold the mouth open wide enough to admit the airflow  from the inflator fan. It is best to inflate the balloon as full as  possible. At a minimum, inflate the balloon to approximately  75 percent full of cold air.  

As the envelope inflates, the pilot should check to see that  control lines are correctly deployed and the deflation panel  is correctly positioned. This can all be done through or in  the vent or from the top; it is not necessary to walk on the  fabric. During this phase of the inflation, the envelope should  also be checked again for damage that would disqualify the  balloon from flight.  

Once the preflight inspection and cold inflation are complete,  and the pilot is satisfied that the envelope contains enough  ambient air to begin hot inflation, the two crewmembers  at the mouth should hold it open as wide and as tall as  possible to keep the fabric away from the burner flame. The  crewmembers should face away from the burner. At this  point, fan speed may be reduced to approximately one-half  or two-thirds full throttle and the pilot may light the burner’s  pilot lights in preparation for inflation. Before activating  the blast valve, the pilot should make eye contact with each  crewmember at the mouth and make sure each is ready.  Crew readiness is paramount. The crew at the mouth of the  envelope must be aware the burner is about to be used.  

Allow the fan to run at a reduced speed until the balloon  mouth lifts off the ground and is no longer receiving air. If the  fan is turned off too soon, envelope air comes back out of the  mouth and the backwash distorts the flame at the beginning  and end of each blast. Do not hurry to turn off the fan. Some  pilots elect to shut off the fuel to the inflator fan, which  accomplishes two things. This procedure normally allows  a fan to continue running for about a minute, which should  be long enough to inflate the balloon, and also allow fuel in  the fan’s carburetor to be used, eliminating the likelihood  of gas fumes should the fan be stored in an enclosed space  during transport.  

The first burn or blast of the burner should be a short one  to confirm the correct direction of the flame and to check  the readiness of the mouth crew. If they are startled by the  flame or noise and drop the fabric, the short burn prevents  or minimizes damage. To reduce discomfort of the crew,  it is best to inflate the balloon with a series of short burns  and pauses, rather than one continuous blast. Inflate using  standard burns, with short pauses of about 2 or 3 seconds  between burns. The pauses give the fabric and skin a chance  to cool and allow communication between the pilot and the  crew, if necessary. Under some circumstances, contraction  and inflation of the balloon mouth may be seen. Burns should  be timed to match the expansion of the mouth. These mouth  movements are called “breathing”; burns should be timed to  match the open time to avoid damaging the fabric.  

Some pilots prefer to inflate the balloon with one long blast  of the burner. The advantage of this type of inflation is that  the balloon inflates a few seconds faster and the mouth  tends to stay fully open during the process. There are several  disadvantages. Voice communication is nearly impossible  due to the noise of the burner. Anyone or anything within a  few feet of the burner may get burned. Also, some burners  could be discolored or damaged by long burns.  

The next step is to continue the burn-and-pause routine until  the balloon is nearly ready to leave the ground. The crew  should be standing by the basket ready to hold the balloon  (“hands on” or “weight on”), in case of a miscalculation,  allowing the balloon to start lifting off the ground before  the pilot is ready. The use of the safety harness prevents  unplanned departures.  

Many pilots fail to achieve equilibrium or neutral buoyancy  immediately after inflation. If equilibrium is not achieved, the  balloon is much more susceptible to wind. For example, if the  envelope is not full, a slight wind can cave in a side causing  a spinnaker effect. If the balloon is standing, but not ready  to fly, the pilot has only one option should the balloon start  to move horizontally; the pilot must deflate. If the balloon is  only 5 or 10 seconds of heat away from lifting off, the pilot  has the choice of deflation or launch.  

The inflation is the first action of ballooning that requires  a pilot in command (PIC). The inflation should be safe and  efficient. Now, the balloon is almost ready to launch.  

# Prelaunch Check  

After the balloon is inflated and upright, the pilot should  perform a pre-launch check. Ensure that loose equipment  is properly stowed and secured. For balloons using multiple  tanks, it may be appropriate to shut off the tank that was used  for inflation, and open the tank that will be used first for  flight. Some pilots make another quick check of the burner  to ensure that there are no leaks or deficiencies present. The  top cap should be activated to release the tabs (as necessary),  and ensure that the mechanism is functioning properly. The  altimeter, if not previously set, should be set to the proper  barometric pressure or field elevation, and the temperature  indicating system should be checked for a proper reading.  If used, radios should be turned on and secured. The pilot  should note the time of inflation, and quickly check the fuel  level in each tank to ensure that there is sufficient fuel for  the planned flight. This pre-launch check should be brief and  verified through the use of a pre-launch checklist.  

# Launch  

If carrying passengers, now is the time to invite them in the  basket. Immediately compensate for the additional weight  with sufficient heat to regain equilibrium. The passengers  have already been briefed on the correct landing procedure.  Brief them again on behavior in the basket. Advise passengers  not to touch any control lines, take care of their possessions,  stay within the confines of the basket, and, above all, to obey  the PIC.  

At least one crewmember should remain near the basket in  case the pilot or passengers need assistance. This is a good  time to give the crew a final briefing regarding the expected  distance and length of the flight, radio channels, and other last  minute instructions. If other balloons are launching from the  same area, ask a crewmember to step back from the balloon  to check that it is clear above.  

Two or three standard burns in a row from equilibrium  usually provide a slow departure from the ground. If there  are no nearby, downwind obstacles to clear, a slow ascent  rate is preferred to test wind direction and detect subtle wind  changes. Climbing at a slow rate is the best way to avoid  running into balloons above. There is an unwritten rule in  ballooning (not regulatory) that the balloon below has the  right of way (due to lack of visibility above). Although  the balloon below has the right of way, the higher balloon  needs time to climb out of the way, if necessary. Pilots must  maintain awareness of other balloons operating near them,  particularly in crowded or rally situations.  [Figure 6-15]  

A fast ascent rate from launch is only to avoid ground  obstacles or to pass quickly through an adverse wind, and  only when it is clear above. Should circumstances require a  

![](images/4b7c1fc705873149e7ade041f62185d7389c87d1f57deb46ec2944588135c2d0.jpg)  
Figure 6-15.   The balloon below has the right of way while ascending.  The pilot of the higher balloon should, as a courtesy and in the  interest of safety, yield the right of way to the ascending balloon,  as that pilot is probably unable to see the balloon above.  

fast ascent rate, the pilot should set up for the lift off by having  the ground crew put their weight on the basket by hanging  their arms over the side, not holding on. The pilot should  then heat the balloon to a temperature beyond that needed for  equilibrium;  $20^{\circ}$   above the neutral buoyancy point may be a  good starting point. After getting a check of possible traffic  above the balloon, the pilot instructs the crew, “weight off,”  and the crew responds by removing their weight from the  basket. It is imperative that the crew clears the basket, and  that no crewmembers are left hanging outside. The balloon  then rises at a fairly rapid ascent rate. The pilot must be aware  that the balloon is marginally under control at this point,  and that too excessive a climb rate may result in a condition  known as “floating the top.” This is a scenario where the air  pressure created by the climb may push the top cap of the  balloon down, causing an out-of-control descent. Maximum  climb rates are specified in the operating limitations section  of the balloon’s flight manual.  

It is very easy to be distracted during launch and make an  unintentional descent. Make sure all ground business is taken  care of, such as instructing the chase crew and stowing all  equipment correctly, before leaving the ground.  

The pilot should be aware of the possibility of uncommanded  lift (often referred to as “false lift”) and the possibility of an  unplanned descent caused by surface wind or an ascent from  a sheltered launch site. Pay attention to people and obstacles,  including the chase vehicle, fences, and particularly to  powerlines. Realize where all powerlines are and visually  locate them as soon as possible.  

# Uncommanded (False) Lift  

One consideration that must be made at the outset of any  balloon flight is the possibility of experiencing phenomena  variously referred to as “false lift,” “false heavy,” or  “uncommanded buoyancy.” These terms all describe an  onset of various factors and conditions, which, despite  the differences in terminology, all relate to the result of  air moving over or under the balloon. The most important  thing to remember is a balloon encountering one or more of  these factors is not under the full and complete control of  the pilot, and is therefore a hazard. Pilots should be aware  of these conditions, avoid them if possible, and be aware  of procedures and practices to minimize their effect on the  balloon’s flight.  

Three areas of focus warrant discussion:  

•  False lift •  False heavy (air flow under the lower portion of  balloon, creating downward lift) •  Envelope distortion causing diminished capacity  

It is important to understand the total physics involved. While  the balloon is at neutral buoyancy on the ground, there are  two lift forces at work. The first is from the heating of the air,  creating buoyancy inside the envelope. The second is the flow  of air over the top. The lift from these two elements combine  to create the lift necessary to be at equilibrium. The addition  of a small amount of heat, through a short burn, increases the  total lift and allows the balloon to rise.  

# False Lift  

During initial flight training, pilots are taught about the effects  of air flowing over the top of the envelope. While the balloon  is static on the ground, the shape of the top forces the flow  of air to compress over the top creating a low pressure area.  [Figure 6-16]  This low pressure area creates lift in much the  same way an airplane wing does. There are two components  of lift: heated air inside the envelope and the lift created by  the air passing over the top. As the balloon takes off and  accelerates to the speed of the air mass, the flow of air over  the top diminishes, thus any lift created by it is no longer  available. If the balloon is at equilibrium at launch, and there  is not some response by the pilot to add more heat, there will  

![](images/864045fb36305eace05c03b6ec7725c54002ced72b0357f20dfda66bf79c1e99.jpg)  
Figure 6-16.  False lift dynamics.  

not be sufficient lift to stay in the air, as a portion of the total  lift has diminished.  

Pilots are usually taught that the lift created by air flow over  the top is to be considered “false lift,” because it was not  created by applying heat to the envelope. The lift is real;  as long as the speed of the air flow and the balloon remain  sufficiently different, the lift continues to be generated. As  the balloon accelerates, the lift created by the air flow is lost  and more heat must be added to maintain the same rate of  ascent.  

The same condition can exist when descending through a  low level wind shear or jet. As the balloon penetrates the  lower boundary of the wind shear, the top of the balloon is  momentarily in a faster moving layer of air which increases the  air flow lift component of the total lift generated. For a short  period, there may be equilibrium with the two components of  lift, heat and air flow. As the descent continues, the top of the  balloon moves out of the faster moving air (the value of one  of the lift components), and air flow is diminished. The rate  of descent increases, unless the pilot takes action to increase  the buoyancy portion of the total lift by making a burn. Some  pilots, when experiencing this, believe it to be a “false heavy”  situation, an incorrect perception.  

# False Heavy (Downward Lift)  

False heavy is a condition which is the exact opposite of the  false lift scenario described above, except that it is happening  at another part of the balloon and the force generated has a  downward component.  

This phenomenon occurs when descending into a faster  moving air mass or wind shear. The lower half of the balloon  enters the shear and the surface of the balloon allows the air  flow to generate lift. This lift is tangent to the surface of the  balloon. Because it is below the equator, where the tangent  line points in a downward direction, the lift has a downward  component. This downward component of lift pulls the  balloon down.  [Figure 6-17]  

![](images/20d2f773f6cc9de4c8403c4707b6b69677fc530b04f42d9754157dfa8233d786.jpg)  
Figure 6-17.  False heavy dynamics.  

This effect is more severe on a fully loaded balloon than  a lightly loaded one, by reasons of skin tension. A lightly  loaded balloon has more slack in the fabric on the lower  portion of the balloon. On a heavily loaded balloon, the fabric  below the equator has greater tension providing a surface  where a low pressure can develop.  

A scenario having much less impact is fast moving air across  the mouth of the balloon. This creates a dynamic low pressure,  similar to a venturi, which may cause the air to be pulled out of  the envelope. As the air moves over the mouth of the balloon,  it creates the dynamic low pressure, which pulls the static  air inside the envelope out. Of all the possibilities discussed  here, this point has the least impact on the lifting capability  of the balloon, but is important when standing on the ground  following the initial inflation to equilibrium.  

# Diminished Capacity  

Another way in which a wind shear can increase the rate of  descent is by diminishing the capacity of the envelope. For  example, when descending, below is a low level wind shear  with the air near the surface moving much faster or slower  than the air mass in which the balloon is traveling. As the  balloon enters the lower air mass, the side of the balloon  is pushed in, decreasing the capacity of the envelope and  pushing the air out the mouth. The larger the difference  between the speed of the two air masses, the greater the effect.  The lift created by buoyancy is decreased and the balloon  starts to descend. If this happens at a low altitude, and the  pilot has not responded in a timely manner, this may result  in a hard landing.  

If a balloon descends abruptly from a   $30~\mathrm{{mph}}$   wind into a   $15~\mathrm{mph}$   wind, it experiences an effective abrupt increase  in wind across its surface from no wind to a 15 mph wind.  This removes the boundary layer on its surface and greatly  increases heat lost by conduction, while causing distortion in  the form of a “dish.” This condition is very dangerous to the  low level flight of a fully loaded balloon. It should be noted  that as the envelope lowers into the slower wind and begins  to distort and slow-up, the effective wind speed over the top  begins to increase. Air moving over the top of an envelope  produces false lift. Combined with diminished capacity, this  again presents a hazardous condition which may result in an  extremely hard landing.  

“Dishing” usually does not affect the flight path of a  lightly loaded balloon as much as a more heavily loaded  balloon because no internal lifting heat is dumped; it is only  redistributed inside the distorted envelope. To understand  what a “dish” can do to lift, the balloon pilot needs to  understand how the “heat line” fluctuates under different  loading conditions. A balloon “floats” in the air because the  hot air inside it weighs less than the volume of air it displaces.  Usually the bottom of the heated air is down close to its  mouth. Notice that a normal two-second single burn on a  heavily loaded balloon adds only a small percentage of heat  compared to its total required hot air volume. The same burn  in a lightly loaded balloon adds a much larger percentage of  lifting heat compared to its total required hot air volume. This  is a simple way to visualize responsiveness.  

If a heavily loaded envelope experiences a major “dish,”  important lifting heat can be squeezed out. This condition is  extremely serious if on a final approach to landing because  there is not enough time and altitude to add enough heat.  Remember, not only must the heat loss be replaced to make  the balloon neutrally buoyant, but more must be added to  stop any downward momentum.  

Heat loss can change the slope of the approach and, pilot  unaware, make it steeper. The stronger the shear, the greater  the change in slope. Knowledge of this and the importance  of adding heat quickly could prevent an excessively hard  landing or an accident.  

Some signs of shear to watch for are any movement of crown  lines, handling lines, throat ropes, skirt, or even basket  movement. It is important to realize that as the balloon lowers  into the slower moving air, distorts, and starts slowing, the  effect of heat loss can be masked by false lift. Even if the  shear is a mild one, false lift momentarily exists. When  the balloon slows enough and exits the faster moving air,  the hidden false lift and dishing disappear and the balloon  descends out of control.  

Some pilots intentionally create a situation of diminished  capacity when making a high performance descent. In  low or stable wind conditions, this can be successfully  executed. However, in the presence of strong wind shears,  this technique can prove disastrous.  

If a pilot is in a false lift scenario, the first action should be  to continue to fly the balloon. If the situation is encountered  during lift-off, or is believed to exist, the pilot should maintain  a positive rate of climb until the false lift dissipates. If the  false heavy scenario exists during the landing, the pilot  must be prepared for an acceleration in the descent rate. An  appropriate action would be to add heat to slow the descent,  unless a steep approach to landing is desired.  

In reality, there is nothing false about any of these situations.  They are real and may create hazardous flight dynamics. In  many cases, more than one of these elements is at work. It  is important for the pilot to be aware of them, their effects,  and consider what actions are necessary when they are  encountered. The best prevention is anticipating these  conditions and maintaining situational awareness. If the  conditions are extreme, it may be said that the best and first  consideration is staying on the ground.  

# Landowner Relations  

An otherwise perfect flight can be marred without the  use of the proper relationship skills needed to foster good  landowner relations. Often neglected, these skills provide  the balloon pilot the locations necessary to inflate, launch,  and land. Without these properties, ballooning would be  severely limited. Taking the time to explain one’s actions to  a landowner, or dealing with a farmer whose livestock have  been spooked by an ill-timed contour flight, can create lasting  impressions that have tremendous long-term negative impact  on the continued evolution of the sport.  

Once a launch site is selected, the pilot should make an effort  to identify the property as public or private. Generally, school  fields and local parks may be used without further inquiry  unless there have been previous problems with balloons. In  such a case it would be appropriate to check with the local  authorities for the use of these facilities.  

Private property, however, is another issue. A balloon pilot  and crew should never assume the right to use a private  location to launch or recover a balloon. To do so exhibits  a degree of arrogance that has no place in ballooning  and subjects everyone participating to trespass laws. The  landowner usually lives on the property and has paid for  that right. In the event that no one is immediately available,  the pilot should either select another launch site or perhaps  inquire of neighbors who may be able to inform you of the  landowner’s location. Finding the landowner and obtaining  permission to use a particular field may be one of the most  important tasks of the launch process for the crew chief, if  one is assigned. Undoubtedly, the one time the pilot does  not have appropriate authorization for use of a launch site  and uses another’s property, someone will be watching and  problems later ensue.  

The positive side of this is that most landowners welcome  the balloon pilot and his crew, want to learn a little about  balloons, and gladly allow the use of their property for  the launch. Many see this as an opportunity and actively  participate in the process. Others may grant permission, but  stand back from the activity. Whichever type of landowner  is encountered, they usually respond positively to a pilot and  crew that respect rights and protects landowner interests.  

# Chapter Summary  

It is frequently said that every pilot sets up equipment and  prepares for flight in a different manner. The purpose of this  chapter is not to emphasize those differences, but rather to  illustrate the underlying similarities and procedures that every  balloon pilot must follow to safety begin a flight.  

During the launch phase of a flight, building/landowner  relations is an easy task. The pilot should select launch sites  that avoid flight paths and landings around sensitive areas,  such as livestock, expensive crops, nature preserves, etc.  

# Chapter 7 Inﬂight  Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses various aspects of inflight maneuvers.  It covers the standard burn, level flight, ascents and descents,  maneuvering and lateral control, and contour flying. This  chapter also includes information on chase crew management,  landowner relations, and tethering.  

# The Standard Burn  

To fly with precision, the balloon pilot needs to know how  much heat is going into the envelope at any given time and  how that heat affects the balloon’s performance. Balloon  pilots have few outside sources, instruments, or gauges to  help them fly. When a balloon pilot uses the burner, there is  no direct way of knowing exactly how much lift is increased.  Because there are few mechanical aids to help balloon pilots  fly, some methodology must be devised to standardize a  pilot’s input action, so the outcomes of those actions are  predictable and the balloon is controllable. The standard burn  is one way to gauge in advance the balloon’s reaction to the  use of the burner.  [Figure 7-1]  

The standard burn is an attempt to calibrate the amount of  heat being used, and is defined as a burn of four seconds. If  each burn can be made identical, the balloon pilot can think  and plan, in terms of number of burns, rather than just using  random, variable amounts of heat with an unknown effect.  The standard burn is based on using the blast valve or trigger  valve found on most balloon burners. Some brands use a valve  that requires only a fraction of an inch of movement between  closed and open, and some require moving the blast valve  handle  $90^{\circ}$  . While the amount of motion required to change  the valve from fully closed to fully open varies, the principle  remains the same—make each burn identical to another.  

The inexperienced pilot should begin with the premise that the  average balloon requires one standard burn of four seconds  every 25 to 40 seconds in order to maintain level flight.  Experience determines the exact length of time between burn  intervals, and how other variables such as weight and ambient  air temperature affect those intervals. The primary goal is to  determine the rhythm of burns necessary to maintain level  flight. All other maneuvers, then, become a departure from  this point. The burn begins with the brisk, complete opening  of the blast valve and ends with the brisk, complete closing of  the valve at the end of the burn. During their training, some  pilots count “one, one thousand; two, one thousand; three,  one thousand; four, one thousand” to develop the timing.  

The standard burn does not mean a burn that is standard  between pilots, but rather, it is an attempt for the individual  pilot to make all burns exactly the same length. The goal is  not only to make each burn exactly the same length, but also  to make each burn exactly the same. The pilot must open and  close the valve exactly the same way each time. Most balloon  burners were designed to operate with the blast valve fully  open for short periods of time. When the blast valve is only  partially opened, two things happen:  

2.  The pilot is not sure how much heat is being  generated.  

# Burner Ratings  

During any discussions of burner output, talk usually turns to  the issue of “burner ratings”; that is, the amount of heat actually  produced by a speciﬁc burner. Invariably, the talk turns into a “my  burner is better than yours” type of exchange. In reality, there  is virtually no difference between the burners produced by the  major manufacturers and their respective output.  

A pilot needs to understand the concept of British Thermal Units,  or BTU, as a measurement of output. A BTU is deﬁned as the  quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound  of water by one degree Fahrenheit. While not particularly relevant  to heating air, this has come to be a generally accepted form of  measure for burner output. Of the four major manufacturers,  three rate their burners at 18 to 19 million BTU output; the fourth  at 43.9 million (with the caveat that that is produced at a supply  line pressure of 200 PSI, well above the pressures that most  balloonists use). A pilot needs to be aware that BTU output in a  balloon burner equates to the amount of propane that is burned in  an hour; BTU output is usually computed on this basis. Referring  to the Propane Primer in Chapter 2, propane has a nominal value  of 91,600 BTU per gallon under ideal circumstances. A simple  mathematical calculation indicates that the average burner (a  18.5 million BTU rating) consumes approximately 202 gallons  of fuel per hour. (18.5 million BTU divided by 91,600 BTU per  gallon of propane = 201.96 gallons of fuel)  

However, balloon burners are not used for an hour at a time;  instead, they are used for very short periods of time, as discussed  on page 7-2. If the numbers above are recalculated, it can be  said that the standard burn of four seconds, as described in this  section, puts approximately 5,139 BTU of heat into the balloon’s  envelope. Remember, this is a theoretical statement of heat  available, as no burner is 100 percent efﬁcient.  

There are numerous factors involved in burner design, such  as volume backpressures, restrictions in the internal plumbing  design, and more, all of which contribute to the ﬁnal output rating.  It is helpful to remember that the mathematics of burner design  reveals the fact that output is a linear equation, when compared  to pressure input; there is a direct correlation between the fuel  line pressure and the burner’s output. This is not the case with  the noise output of the burner, as the noise output increases  exponentially as the pressure is increased. Reduction of burner  noise represents the next hurdle in burner design; perhaps  someday it will be possible to enjoy an almost silent balloon  ﬂight.

1.  The burner does not operate at full efficiency, and  A partially opened valve is producing a fraction of the heat  available, but there is no way of knowing what the fraction  is.  [Figure 7-2]

Another advantage of briskly opening and closing the valve  is to minimize the presence of a yellow, soft flame. During  inflation, for instance, a strong, narrow, pointed flame that  goes into the mouth opening without overheating the mouth  fabric or crew is desirable. A partial-throttle flame is wide  and short and subject to distortion by wind or the inflation  fan. If less than a full burn is desired, shorten the time the  valve is open and not the amount the valve is open. Due to  burner design (and the inefficiency of a partially opened  valve), four 1-second burns do not produce as much heat as  one 4-second burn.  

If the mechanical aspects of flying can be learned, the  systematic cadence can be converted into a rhythm that is  smooth and polished. With practice, the rhythm becomes  second nature and pilots fly with precision, without thinking  about it. Using the standard burn, pilots can better predict the  effect of each burn, minimize the potential danger of a burn  to the envelope, and have a better flame pattern. The standard  burn is referred to when discussing specific maneuvers.  

# Straight and Level Flight  

Level flight, or equilibrium, is probably the most important  of all flight maneuvers, as it serves as a baseline from which  all other maneuvers are derived. A good pilot maintains level  flight with a series of standard burns.  

Level flight is achieved when lift exactly matches weight  and the balloon neither ascends nor descends, but remains  at one altitude. For every altitude, there is an equilibrium  temperature. If a pilot is flying at 500 feet mean sea level  (MSL) and wants to climb to 1,000 feet MSL, the balloon  temperature must be increased. This is not only to attain  equilibrium at the new (higher) altitude, but some excess  temperature must also be created to overcome inertia and  get the balloon moving.  

Theoretically, if a pilot were to hold a hot air balloon at a  constant temperature, the balloon would float at a constant  altitude. However, there is no practical way to hold the  envelope air temperature constant. Each time the pilot burns,  the balloon tends to climb. The air in the envelope is always  cooling and the balloon tends to descend. If the subsequent  burns are perfectly timed, the balloon flies in a series of very  shallow sine waves.  [Figure 7-3, Line A]  Of course, any  variable changes the balloon flight. A heavier basket load,  higher ambient temperature, or sunny day all require more  fuel (by shortening the interval between burns) to maintain  level flight.  

In discussions of level flight, the terms “flying light” and  “flying heavy” are sometimes used and bear explanation.  A balloon is said to be “flying light” when the sine wave  being described in the air is predominately on the high side  of the desired altitude  [Figure 7-3, Line B] . Many new or  inexperienced pilots tend to fly light, and use the vent line  in order to return to the desired altitude; this may create a  situation where the pilot gets into a constant overcontrolling  exercise and is best avoided. “Flying heavy” can be described  as a scenario where the sine wave is predominately on the  low side of the desired altitude  [Figure 7-3, Line  $C J$  ; if the  balloon is left alone, it tends to fall. Flying heavy can be  hazardous when contour flying. A balloon pilot must use all  visual cues available and exercise a “finesse” type of control  when contour flying (described later in this chapter).  

Through experimentation, standards can be established that  may be used as a basis for all flights. With practice and using  the second hand of a wristwatch, a new pilot can fly almost  level. The exercise of learning the pattern of burns (each day  and hour is different) is an interesting training exercise, but  not a practical real-life technique. The ability to hold a hot air  balloon at a given altitude for any length of time is a skill that  

![](images/b58266df55d70f0e4e3a957b54439a026ba95d1ea4620e60b8c92fde554ebb1d.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.   Example of normal flight (Line A), flying light (Line B), and flying heavy (Line C).  

comes only with serious practice. Unfortunately, most pilots  do not spend enough time practicing level flight. During the  practical test, given a choice of altitudes, it is easier to fly  level at a lower altitude, due to the ease of acquiring visual  references. However, the pilot must exercise care not to  violate minimum safe altitude requirements (explained later  in this chapter), and must be constantly alert for obstacles  such as power lines in the flightpath.  

# Ascents and Descents  

The temperature of the air inside the envelope controls  balloon altitude. A balloon that is neither ascending nor  descending is in equilibrium. To cause the balloon to ascend,  increase the temperature of the air inside the envelope. If the  temperature is increased just a little, the balloon seeks an  altitude only a little higher and/or climb at a very slow rate.  If the temperature is increased significantly, the balloon seeks  a much higher altitude and/or climbs faster. If the balloon is  allowed to cool or hot air is vented, the balloon descends.  

Even without the input action by the pilot, it must be  remembered that the air inside the envelope is dynamic.  The air mass is constantly moving within the confines of the  envelope, attempting to seek a level of equalization. While it  varies with each envelope, input action by the balloon pilot  can take from 6 to 15 seconds to be realized as a reaction by  the balloon. Planning the maneuver, anticipating the reaction  time, inputting the proper burn, and observing the reaction  must result in smooth and natural movement by the pilot.  

# Ascents  

Using evenly spaced, identical standard burns to fly level, a  pilot needs to make only two consecutive burns to have added  excess heat to make the balloon climb. For example, if the  pilot can maintain level flight with a standard burn every 35  seconds, and then makes two burns in succession instead of  one, the balloon has an extra burn and climbs. How fast the  balloon climbs depends on how much extra heat has been  added. Under nominal conditions, if the standard burn has  been made to hold the balloon at level flight and a second  burn is within a few seconds (not waiting the 35 seconds),  the average balloon starts a slow climb. Three consecutive  burns results in a faster climb.  

Once the desired climb rate is established, return to the level  flight routine to hold the balloon at that rate. The higher the  altitude, or the faster the rate of climb, the shorter the interval  between burns. In an average size balloon (usually a 77, 000  or 90,000 cubic foot envelope) at 5,000 feet, the pilot may be  required to make a standard burn every 15 to 20 seconds to  keep the balloon climbing at 500 feet per minute (fpm). At  sea level, the same rate may require burning only every 30  to 40 seconds. Burn rates cannot be predicted in advance, but  practice provides a basis to begin with and experimentation  finds the correct burn rate for a particular day’s ambient  temperature, altitude, envelope size, and balloon weight.  

Another skill to develop in ascents is knowing when to stop  burning so the balloon will slow and level at the chosen  altitude. The transition from a climbing mode to level flight  involves estimating the momentum and coasting up to the  desired or assigned altitude. One methodology is illustrated  in  Figure 7-4 . During this flight, the pilot has decided to  leave his current altitude (A) and climb to another (C). While  climbing, the pilot adjusts burn times to be at a 100 fpm rate  of climb by the time he or she is at a point 100 feet below the  desired altitude (B). Under most circumstances, the balloon  “coasts” the additional 100 feet and rounds out, or resumes  level flight, at the desired altitude. It may be necessary to  use the vent for a short time to stop the ascent with caution  not to vent excessively, thereby causing the balloon to go  into a descent. The balloon pilot must remember that each  manufacturer has a specific interval that the vent can be  opened while in flight. Should that interval be exceeded, it  can have a disastrous result. With practice and application,  the pilot can learn this skill without the use of the vent, not  only conserving fuel, but also flying a much more controlled  flight.  

Generally, to achieve a smooth transition to the new altitude,  the rate of ascent should not exceed the distance to the new  altitude. For example, if the balloon pilot is 500 feet below  the desired new altitude, the rate of climb should not exceed   $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$  . When the pilot is 300 feet below the desired altitude,  the rate of climb should not exceed 300 fpm. An ascent of  200 to   $300~\mathrm{fpm}$   is slow enough to detect wind changes at  different altitudes, which is helpful in maneuvering. Above   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  , it is possible to fly through small, narrow wind  bands or wind with very small direction changes without  noticing. It is a good idea to launch and climb at a slow  speed (100 to  $200\,\mathrm{fpm})$  ) to make an early decision regarding  which direction to fly.  

![](images/5fbb06bdc9af608b7f87ec864958478549771610af58f11c64d47d1385260a35.jpg)  
Figure 7-4.   Ascent schematic.  

# Descents  

The only direct control of the balloon the pilot has is vertical  motion; the pilot can make the balloon go up by adding heat.  Therefore, the pilot can make it come down by venting or  not adding heat. For horizontal or lateral motion, a balloon  pilot must rely on wind, which may or may not be going in  the desired direction. A good pilot learns to control vertical  motion precisely and variably for maximum lateral choice.  

To start a descent from level flight, skip one burn, and then  return to the level flight regimen to hold the descent at a  constant rate. Alternatively, hot air balloons are equipped  with a vent. When opened, the vent releases hot air from the  envelope and draws cooler air in at the mouth, thus reducing  the overall temperature and allowing the balloon to descend.  A pilot should learn to calibrate the use of the vent, as well  as the burners, and know how much air is being released in  order to know what effect to expect. For predictability, time  the vent openings and open the vent precisely. Parachute  vent balloons usually have a manufacturer’s limitation on  how long the vent may be open. Use the vent sparingly; it  should not be used instead of patience, unless a rapid change  in altitude is needed.  

A new pilot can learn the classic balloon flare by matching the  vertical speed indicator (VSI) to the altimeter, i.e., descend  500 fpm from 500 feet above ground level (AGL), 400 fpm  from 400 feet AGL. Below 200 feet, a pilot should not use  instruments, but look below for obstacles, especially power  lines. This maneuver is illustrated in  Figure 7-5 . Departing  from the altitude indicated at “ A,” the pilot allows the balloon  to start a descent. During the descent, the pilot maintains a  reasonable rate of descent, slowing to a rate of 200 fpm at  B. By the time the balloon reaches C, the pilot should have a  rate of descent of 100 fpm, and by using one or two standard  burns, should be able to level off (“round out”) at the desired  new altitude.  

# Rapid/Steep Descents  

A rapid, or steep, descent in a balloon is a relative term. A  700 fpm descent started at 3,000 feet AGL is not necessarily  rapid; however, if started at 300 feet AGL, it is rapid and may  be critical. Rapid descents should be made with adequate  ground clearance and distance from obstacles.  

To execute a steep descent, the balloon pilot must be well  aware of the balloon’s response times and have sufficient  altitude for the maneuver. In  Figure 7-6,  the pilot has initiated  

![](images/17d20b732cd4d944dea7b2a30a08876e70f62fb1d7695fcea91fa69f3b846e65.jpg)  
Figure 7-5.   Descent schematic.  

a steep descent at Point A. For this discussion, assume that  altitude is 1,500' AGL. The descent may be initiated either  through the use of the vent or by holding two or three burns.  By the time the balloon reaches the point indicated at B, it  may be descending in excess of   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  ; the pilot should  make a standard burn at this point, as the air passing over the  envelope fabric accelerates cooling. A standard burn ensures  that the balloon maintains a temperature sufficient to keep  it under control throughout the maneuver. This burn should  not slow the descent.  

At a point halfway between the ground and the previous  burn  [Figure 7-6, Point   $C J$  ,  the pilot should make a long  (twice standard length) burn; if there is no reaction from the  balloon, then the pilot should do another burn. Immediately  upon sensing a reaction from the balloon, the pilot should  stop the burn and allow the balloon to descend to a proper  pullout altitude.  [Figure 7-6, Point D]  If done properly, the  deceleration burns stops the balloon’s descent just above  the desired altitude or the ground. This maneuver requires  experience and practice; timing is critical.  

During the initial stages of learning this maneuver, the pilot  should set a “floor” (altitude lower limit) to practice with.  

As the pilot gains more skill, as well as confidence, that  “floor” may be lowered until the pilot is able to execute the  maneuver to ground level.  

# Maneuvering  

The art of controlling the horizontal (lateral) direction of a  free balloon is the highest demonstration of ballooning skill.  The balloon is officially a nonsteerable aircraft. Despite  the fact that balloons are nonsteerable, some pilots seem  to be able to steer their balloons better than others. Being  knowledgeable of the wind at various altitudes, both before  launch and during flight, is the key factor for maneuvering.  

Maneuvering, or steering, comes indirectly from varying  one’s time at different altitudes and different wind directions.  The pilot must have knowledge of the winds at different  levels, as previously discussed in Chapter 3, Preflight  Planning, as well as being able to determine the balloon’s  direction in flight.  

# Winds Below  

When in flight, winds below can be observed in many ways.  Observe smoke, trees, dust, flags, and especially ponds  and lakes to see what the wind is doing on the ground. To  

![](images/598781af2fdeb0890f3e9e6b251557671a0e299c71d64807c7752d8e023f41aa.jpg)  
Figure 7-6.   Steep descent schematic (not to scale).  

determine what is happening between the balloon and the  ground, watch other balloons, if any.  

Another means of checking winds below is to drop a very  light object and watch it descend to the ground. However,  exercise caution with this method. Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 allows objects to be  dropped from the air that will not harm anything below.  14 CFR section 91.15, Dropping Objects, states “No pilot  in command of a civil aircraft may allow any object to be  dropped from that aircraft in flight that creates a hazard to  persons or property. However, this section does not prohibit  the dropping of any object if reasonable precautions are taken  to avoid injury or damage to persons or property.”  

Some items that may dropped without creating a hazard are  small, air-filled toy balloons, small balls made of a single  piece of tissue, or a small glob of shaving cream from an  aerosol can. A facial tissue, about   $8"\texttt{x}8"$  , rolled into a  sphere about the size of a ping-pong ball works well. These  balls fall at about  $350\,\mathrm{fpm}$  , can be seen for several hundred  feet, and are convenient to carry. Counting as the tissue ball  descends, a pilot can estimate the heights of wind changes  by comparing times to the ground with the altimeter reading.  Experiment by dropping some of these objects, practice  reading the indications, and plan accordingly.  

# Direction  

There are several methods of accurately determining the  balloon’s direction at any given moment, particularly with  the advent of low-cost hand-held global positioning system 

 (GPS) units. However, the pilot should be familiar with 

 “old-school” methods, as GPS units break or fall overboard,  and batteries fail.  

The pilot should first be positioned in the front of the basket,  relative to the direction of flight. Then, the pilot should create  a “sight picture,” using part of the basket’s superstructure,  making an allowance for any possible spin of the basket, and  then select a landmark along the route of flight. This process  takes a few seconds if the landmark does not change position  in relation to the “sight picture.” Then, the line that may be  drawn between the balloon’s current position and the selected  landmark is the ground track of the balloon. It is important  that the pilot maintain a constant altitude while performing  this evaluation; any change in altitude may put the balloon  into a different wind flow, which requires the evaluation to  be performed again.  

It can be helpful to carry a magnetic sighting compass on  the flight. Identifying the bearings to a couple of distant  landmarks and comparing this to the ground track can provide  useful information to the balloon pilot.  

Examine  Figure 3-12  in Chapter 3. If the pilot can make  the mental extrapolation between known wind directions  at different altitudes and the desired direction of travel,  maneuvering the balloon becomes a simple exercise in direct  control, that is, vertical movement.  

# Contour Flying  

Contour flying may be the most fun and most challenging,  but, at the same time, may also be the most hazardous and  misunderstood of all balloon flight maneuvers. A good  definition of contour flying is flying safely at low altitude,  while obeying all regulations, considering persons, animals,  and property on the ground. Safe contour flying means never  creating a hazard to persons in the basket or on the ground,  or to any property, including the balloon.  [Figure 7-7]  

At first glance, the definition is subjective. One person’s  hazard may be another person’s fun. For instance, a person  who has never seen a balloon before may think a basket  touching the surface of a lake is dangerous, while the pilot  may think a splash-and-dash is fun.  

# Minimum Safe Altitude Requirements  

Legal contour flying has a precise definition. While the  FAA has not specifically defined contour, it has specified  exactly what minimum safe altitudes are. 14 CFR part 91,  section 91.119, refers to three different areas: anywhere,  over congested areas, and over other than congested areas,  including open water and sparsely populated areas.  

More balloonists are issued FAA violations for low flying  than for any other reason. Many pilots do not understand the  minimum safe altitude regulation. Many balloonists believe  the regulation was written for heavier-than-air aircraft and  that it does not apply to balloons. That is a false belief; the  regulation was written to protect persons and property on  the ground and it applies to all aircraft, including balloons.  Since this regulation is so important to balloonists, the  following is the applicable portion of 14 CFR part 91, section 

 91.119—Minimum safe altitudes: General.  

“Except when necessary for takeoff or landing, no person  may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:  

(a) Anywhere. An altitude allowing, if a power unit  fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to  persons or property on the surface. (b) Over congested areas. Over any congested area of a  city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly  of persons, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest  obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the  aircraft.  

![](images/ba58067e51469b820e1571686248d257a61dcaa68079af80630f07a6954d7115.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.   Contour flying.  

(c) Over other than congested areas. An altitude of 500  feet above the surface, except over open water or  sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft  may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any  person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.”  

14 CFR part 91, section 91.119(a) requires a pilot to fly  at an altitude that allows for a power unit failure and/or  an emergency landing without undo hazards to persons or  property. All aircraft should be operated so as to be safe, even  in worst-case conditions. Every good pilot is always thinking  “what if...,” and should operate accordingly. This portion of  the regulation can be applied in the following way. When  climbing over an obstacle, a pilot can make the balloon just  clear the obstacle, fly over it with room to spare, or give the  obstacle sufficient clearance to account for a problem or  miscalculation. An obstacle can be overflown while climbing,  descending, or in level flight. Descending over an obstacle  gives the greatest opportunity to misjudge clearance over an  obstacle. In level flight, the danger is reduced. Hazards are  minimized by climbing. Most instructors teach minimizing  the hazard by climbing when approaching an obstacle, thus  giving room to coast over the obstacle in case of a burner  malfunction.  

14 CFR part 91, section 91.119(b) concerns flying over  congested areas, such as settlements, towns, cities, and  gatherings of people. There is no standard definition of  “congested area” or “open air assembly of persons” but case  law has indicated that a subdivision or homes, constitute a  congested area, as does a small rural town.  

A balloon pilot must stay 1,000 feet above the highest  obstacle within a 2,000-foot radius of the balloon. This is  a straightforward regulation and easy to understand. Note  that the highest obstacle is probably an antenna, tower, or  some other tall object, not the rooftops. Two thousand feet is  almost one-half mile. This portion of the regulation is often  forgotten or ignored.  [Figure 7-8]  

A conscientious pilot includes livestock of any form—dairy  cows, horses, poultry—in the 1,000-feet above rule. Domestic  animals, while not specifically mentioned in the regulations,  are considered to be property; and experienced pilots know  that almost all poultry, exotic birds, swine, horses, and cows  may be spooked by the overflight of a balloon. Livestock in  large fields seem to be less bothered by balloons; however,  it is always a good idea to stay at least 1,000 feet away from  domestic animals. This is discussed in detail on page 7-16.  

![](images/6389bc364d7ef8e669450b461d3523c85710b69dff573a2ca06173a2d9cb7ff2.jpg)  
Figure 7-8   Minimum safe altitudes over a congested area.  

14 CFR part 91, section 91.119(c) refers to two area types:  sparsely populated and unpopulated. Here, the pilot must stay  at least 500 feet away from persons, vehicles, vessels, and  structures. “ Away from” is the key to understanding this rule.  The regulation specifies how high above the ground the pilot  must be and also states the pilot may never operate closer  than 500 feet. There exists a possibility for misunderstanding  in interpreting the difference between congested and other  than congested, as neither of these terms are defined by the  FAA regulations. As an example, operating below 1,000 feet  AGL within 2,000 feet of a congested area is in violation of  14 CFR part 91, section 91.119(b), even though the bordering  area may be used only for agricultural purposes. Therefore,  when flying over unpopulated land near a housing tract, the  balloon must fly either above 1,000 feet AGL or be 2,000  feet away from the houses.  

To stay 500 feet away from an isolated farmhouse, imagine  a 1,000-foot diameter clear hemisphere centered over the  building.  [Figure 7-9]  If the balloon is 400 feet away from  the structure on the horizontal plane, the balloon pilot only  need fly about 300 feet AGL to be 500 feet away from it. If  the balloon passes directly over the building, then there must  be a minimum of 500 feet above the rooftop, chimney, or  television antenna to be legal.  

In summary, regulations require:  

1.  Flying high enough to be safe if a problem occurs;  2.  1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a 2,000- foot radius above a congested area; and  3.  An altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over  open water or sparsely populated areas.  

![](images/8929586627a69eb1f6f7ee819fde6e8f453b940a451270a87314dccc461bdfaf.jpg)  
Figure 7-9   Minimum safe altitude over a sparsely populated  area.  

In those cases, the balloon may not be operated closer than  500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure. This is  an easy to understand regulation that requires compliance  from all pilots.  

# Contour Flying Techniques  

Aside from the legal aspects, contour flying is probably the  most difficult flying to perform. The balloon pilot must see all  obstacles on or near the balloon path, remember their location,  and maintain situational and spatial awareness. Terrain or  obstacle height must be estimated and allowed for, and the  pilot must always be prepared for an unexpected situation.  A relationship must be established between the balloon  altitude and the terrain or obstacle height. All these mental  calculations must occur in a few seconds, in a continuous  cycle, as the pilot executes a complicated flight profile.  

The balloon practical test standards (PTS) asks the applicant  to demonstrate contour flying by using all flight controls  properly to maintain the desired altitude based on the  appropriate clearance over terrain and obstacles, consistent  with safety. The pilot must consider the effects of wind gusts,  wind shear, thermal activity and orographic conditions, and  allow adequate clearance for livestock and other animals.  

Since most contour flying is done in unpopulated areas, the  balloon is rarely higher than 300 feet AGL and frequently  much lower; therefore, the balloon’s flight instruments are  seldom observed. Because mechanical instruments have  several seconds lag and electronic instruments are very  sensitive, pilots must rely on their observation and judgment.  

When flying at low altitude, the pilot must be vigilant for  obstacles, especially powerlines and traffic, and not rely  solely on instruments inside the basket. The pilot should  always face the direction of travel, especially at low altitude.  The pilot’s feet and shoulders should be facing forward. The  pilot should turn only his or her head from side to side (not  the entire body) to gauge altitude and to detect or confirm  climbs and descents. Facing the direction of flight cannot  be overemphasized; there are many National Transportation  Safety Board (NTSB) and FAA accident reports describing  balloon contacts with ground obstacles because the pilot was  looking in another direction.  

Contour flying requires somewhat shorter burns than  the standard burn. To fly at low altitudes requires half or  quarter burns. One disadvantage in using small burns is the  possibility of losing track of the heat being created. Precise  altitude control requires special burner techniques. Another  hazard of a series of too small burns is the accumulation  of added heat before the effects of the last burn have been  evaluated. The balloon actually responds to a burn 6 to 15  seconds after the burner is used.  

One technique to determine if the balloon is ascending,  flying level, or descending is to sight potential obstacles in  the flightpath of the balloon, such as the power lines shown  in  Figure 7-10 . As the balloon approaches the wires, the pilot  should determine how the wires (or other obstacles) are moving  in his or her field of vision relative to the background. If they  are moving up in the pilot’s field of vision (shown by the red  arrow), or staying stationary, then the balloon is on a descent  that may place the pilot and passengers at risk. Conversely,  if the wires are moving down in the pilot’s field of vision (as  indicated by the green arrow), then the balloon is either in level  flight or ascending, and able to clear the obstacle.

Figure 7-10   The movement of the power lines either up or down in  the pilot’s field of vision can indicate whether or not the balloon  has sufficient obstacle clearance.  

Some favorite sighting objects are a power pole as the near  object and the line of a road, field, or orchard as the far  object—lines may be observed moving up and down the  poles. Water towers with checkerboard or striped markings  are also good sighting objects. Vigilance is required for  constant scanning of the terrain along the flightpath, and  the pilot must be alert to avoid becoming fixated on sighting  objects. Again, the pilot should look where he or she is going,  not where he or she has been. When flying in proximity to  other balloons, particularly at lower altitudes, it is easy to  become fixated on the other balloon(s) and attempt to follow  their lead. The balloon pilot should remember to fly his or  her balloon and let the other pilots fly theirs.  

The particular pleasures of contour flying can best be enjoyed  in a balloon. It is wonderful to fly at low level over the trees,  drop down behind an orchard, float across a pond just off  the water, watch jackrabbits scatter—see sights up close.  No other aircraft can perform low level contour flying as  safely as in a balloon, and in no other aircraft is the flight  as beautiful. Contour flying can be great fun, but remember  that the balloon should always be flown at legal, safe, and  considerate altitudes.  

# Contour Flying Cautions — Aborted Landings  

The line between contour flying and unsafe, inconsiderate,  and misunderstood practices can sometimes be very fine. Observers often misinterpret aborted landings on the ground  as buzzing or rude flying. Sometimes landing sites seem to be  elusive. A typical situation is the pilot descending to land at an  appropriate site, but miscalculating the winds below and the  balloon turns away from the open field toward a farmhouse.  The farmer sees the balloon descend, turn towards the house,  and, with noisy burners roaring, zoom back into the air and  proceed. The pilot was not being rude or inconsiderate, just  inexperienced. The pilot did not mean to swoop down to buzz  the house; the wind had changed. If  the pilot had watched  something drop from the basket to gauge the winds below or  been more observant, the pilot would have known the balloon  would turn towards the house as it descended. A squirt of  shaving foam from an aerosol can or a small piece of rolled  up tissue could have alerted the pilot of the different wind  at lower altitudes.  

Two or three of these swoops over a sparsely populated area,  and people on the ground may not only think the pilot is  buzzing houses, some people may think the pilot is having  a problem and is in trouble. That is when the well-meaning  landowner calls the police to report a “balloon in trouble.”  Flying too close to a house (a friend’s house, for example)  to say hello, dragging the field, or giving people a thrill by  flying too low over a gathering are examples of buzzing,  which is illegal and can be hazardous.  

# Use of Instruments  

14 CFR part 31 and the balloon manufacturers’ equipment  lists specify certain instruments to be in the balloon. However,  most pilots find they use instruments less and less as they  gain experience and familiarity with the balloon.  

For instance, while the VSI and the altimeter can be used to  execute a smooth descent and transition to level flight, the  experienced pilot refers only occasionally to the instruments  during maneuvers. This is especially so in maneuvers  involving descents where more reliance is placed on sight  pictures and visual references.  

Some beginner pilots become fixated on the instruments  and forget to scan outside for obstacles. If a pilot spends too  much time looking at the flight instruments, the instructor  may cover the instrument pack with a spare glove or a hand  to try to break the formation of a bad habit. Instruments are  required and useful, but should not distract the pilot from  obstacle avoidance. Always practice see-and-avoid.  

# InFlight Emergencies  

An emergency is a sudden, unexpected situation or  occurrence that requires immediate action. In aviation, an  emergency is a critical, possibly life-threatening or property- threatening occurrence that may require outside assistance.  In an emergency, the pilot may violate any regulation as  necessary to safely resolve the emergency, but must be  prepared to justify his or her actions.  

Because of its basic simplicity, there are few catastrophic  failures or emergencies in a hot air balloon. Virtually all  emergency situations involving balloons can be grouped  into three categories:  

•  Loss/malfunction of vent or deflation line •  Loss/malfunction of pilot light •  Fuel leak  

# Loss/Malfunction of Vent or Deﬂation Line  

This is usually thought of as a loss of the envelope valve  control line. This could occur after a particularly windy  inflation, during which the pilot has inadvertently burned  through the control line and failed to notice it prior to launch.  Another variation could be a control line stuck in a guide  pulley, preventing the pilot from being able to control the  parachute vent.  

Regardless of the reason, loss of a control line must be  handled. A pilot experiencing this problem must be prepared  to land the balloon with a minimal amount of control, as he or  she has use only of the burner to affect the descent. The pilot  should maintain minimum altitudes and land in the largest  area possible. If a high wind landing is expected, the pilot  should anticipate rebound and dragging after touchdown;  the pilot also needs to consider the prospect of deliberately  landing the balloon in a less than desirable area in order to  avoid potential power line contacts.  

# Loss/Malfunction of Pilot Light  

Hot air balloon burner pilot lights are extremely reliable;  however, they do fail at times. This is usually caused by a  failure in the valve controlling the pilot light, or clogging of  the orifice in the pilot regulator due to contamination in the  fuel supplying the pilot light.  

In a dual burner system, the failure of a pilot light is not a  serious issue, as the balloon can still be controlled through the  use of the second burner. The pilot may attempt to relight the  pilot light by using both burners at the same time. To some  extent, the pilot may be able to utilize this procedure to fly  the balloon until able to land in a suitable location, should  the extinguished pilot light not relight.  

Pilot light failure in a single burner balloon is of more  concern, as the pilot’s options for continued flight are  reduced. The pilot needs to take immediate action to relight  the pilot light, either through the use of a piezoelectric igniter  (if equipped), or by using a striker or other ignition source.  Many balloon burners are not designed to be conveniently  relit while standing in the basket; this should be practiced  on a periodic basis by the pilot, at a minimum during flight  reviews. Should the pilot light not relight immediately, many  burners can still be utilized by “cracking” the main blast  valve very slightly, and then lighting the fuel stream from the  burner’s jets. Other sources may include the backup system  fitted in that particular balloon. The pilot may slightly open  the valve controlling the backup system, and attempt to light  that stream of propane. In any case, a landing as soon as  practical is probably the best course of action  

# Fuel Leak  

Fuel leaks in flight have the potential for catastrophic results  and must be acted upon immediately. Because of the design  of most balloon fuel systems, there are numerous potential  “leak points” which may be the source for a fuel leak. Fuel  lines and fuel line fittings, tank valves, and blast valves all  have the potential for failure, and the balloon pilot must be  aware of the various circumstances, and be prepared to deal  with them.  

Virtually all in-flight fuel leak emergencies in a balloon can  be dealt with by shutting off the fuel source. Small fires  from leaks around a fuel line fitting may be extinguished  by shutting off the fuel source and then wrapping a gloved  hand around the fitting and “snuffing” out the flame before  it can spread further.  

Because of the variety of systems, valve types, and differences  in operations, a pilot should review the flight manual for his  or her particular balloon system, and be familiar with and  regularly practice the emergency procedures. The previously  listed information is general in nature, and is not specific to  any particular type of balloon, nor should it be taken as a  specific procedure to be followed in the event of an in-flight  emergency. In all cases, the information contained in the  manufacturer’s flight manual should be followed.  

In all emergencies, it is imperative that the pilot maintain  control of the balloon. Many minor problems can quickly  become major problems if the pilot fails to continue to fly  the balloon. Additionally, the use of a checklist for in-flight  emergencies is not appropriate. First, the pilot must resolve  the situation, and then refer to an appropriate checklist or the  balloon’s flight manual to verify the appropriate action.  

# Tethering/Mooring  

Tethering a hot air balloon, despite its apparent simplicity,  is perhaps the most demanding and stressful operation in  ballooning, both in terms of equipment and the pilot. Balloons  are designed to be free flown, not tied to the ground, and  tethering incurs forces on a balloon that can, under certain  circumstances, exceed design limits. The pilot conducting  a tether is often called upon to conduct two or three hours  of precise, “finesse” flying, which many times he or she is  not prepared for. The crew must endure 2 to 3 hours of non- stop handling to manage this complex and often exhausting  operation. Safe conditions fall within narrow ranges and a  safe tether often demands more attention and management  than flying in marginal conditions.  

Every tether situation is unique enough to require tailoring  the operation to specific needs and equipment. However,  the idea of a “simple” tether should not lure the pilot into  underestimating the very real demands and risks that come  with it. A skilled and knowledgeable crew allows a pilot to  take advantage of the many benefits tethering offers. Under  suitable conditions, a well planned multi-hour commercial  tether can last for hours, reach a media audience of millions,  and offer several hundred people their first brief balloon  ride. Regardless of the reasons for tethering a balloon, all  forms of tethering require the same basic preparations and  guidelines for safety.  

The balloon pilot contemplating a tether operation should  remember that the requirements of 14 CFR Part 91, General  Operating and Flight Rules, apply to all operations conducted  with a type-certified hot air balloon. There is a popular  misconception that tether operations are conducted under  the provisions of 14 CFR Part 101, Applicability; this is an  incorrect assumption. T ether operations must be conducted by  a certificated pilot, and may not, under any circumstances, be  performed by an individual not in possession of an airman’s  certificate.  

Laying out the balloon for a properly executed tether operation  requires a little more preparation than a normal launch layout.  Initial planning needs to take into consideration the winds,  both current and forecast, for the period of time the tether is  to be conducted. The tether site should be at least twice, and  preferably three times, the size of a normal launch area for that  particular balloon. It may be surrounded by trees, buildings,  and other obstacles. Under certain circumstances, this may  work to the pilot’s advantage, as these may block low-level,  lower velocity winds. Higher winds may create turbulence  that significantly affects the balloon.  [Figure 7-11]  

There are two primary methods of tethering, the three-line  method and the six-line method. In the three-line method,  lateral lines are attached at the top of the basket, generally  to the suspension of the balloon, to transfer stress loads from  the balloon directly to the lateral lines, and not through the  basket’s superstructure. In the six-line method, three vertical  “bridle” lines are connected from the top of the balloon to the  top of the basket’s superstructure and three additional lines  

![](images/f31a33cc9f42e67a999cc6515c11e5abcb7e29fd939af83dba3aa4945733e9cc.jpg)  
Figure 7-11   Layout schematic for a balloon tether.  

(laterals) are attached to the vertical bridles.  [Figure 7-12] The six-line system is preferable in windier conditions, as  it allows the balloon to move within the framework created  by the bridles and laterals, but keeps the balloon upright  and confined to a relatively small area. The specific setup  required is dependent on the intent of the tether and whether  rides are being offered.  

In almost all cases, the manufacturer’s flight manual specifies  procedures and techniques for tethering the balloon, and  the prudent pilot is aware of these instructions and possible  limitations prior to conducting a tether.  

Tether safety often depends more on flight team skills and  preparation than anything else. The following tethering safety  tips are drawn from the book,  Hot Air Balloon Crewing  Essentials,  by Gordon Schwontkowski, and is an excellent  reference text for balloon pilots as well as crew.  

•  Whether you use a commercially available tether  system or your own quality ropes matters less than  how well and how thoroughly you prepare. Securely  attach two or three tether lines minimum to load rings,  envelope carabiners, or other brand specific point on  your equipment.  

•  Triangulated wind protection is the goal. Attach  tether lines to secure objects such as parked vehicles  so that two lines always distribute wind loads. This  protects you on all sides from turbulence and potential  downdrafts from buildings.  

•  Focus! Constantly watch weather conditions and line  tensions for changes or needed adjustments. Listen  to the crew for feedback and instruction. Direct  

spectators and participants according to your needs  and their safety rather than chatting with them.  

Note and adjust for weather changes. Weather places  great unnatural stresses on tethered balloons. Be  prepared to suspend or cancel a tether at any moment  due to changing weather. Allow extra time for packing  lines and other tether equipment when considering  whether to shut down.  

•  Plan for any one line to fail or come untied with no  notice. Create a backup plan you can implement  immediately to maintain control and safety.  

Watch for spectators and children who want to hang  onto tether lines and ride them off the ground. Keep  all noncrew away from lines; suddenly tight or rising  lines pose risks for all concerned. At NO TIME should  any crew member ever leave the ground (riding or  hanging on the basket, holding ropes, etc.).  

•  Devote one crew member exclusively to organizing  passengers in a line far back from the balloon and  tether lines. Select groups by number, weight, age,  or an appropriate combination of factors.  

Adding weight is necessary on landing and during  passenger switches, giving many opportunities for  someone’s toes or a foot to slip beneath a fully loaded  basket. Keep everyone similarly clear of lines running  to the basket or lower envelope.  

•  Inspect lines frequently to ensure they are attached  securely at both ends, particularly under heavy loads  or in stronger wind conditions.

# Inﬂight Crew Management  

The balloon chase crew does much more during the flight than  merely drive and wait for the balloon to land. As an integral  part of the flight team, the crew can often have a significant  impact on flight safety. Rather than passively follow behind  the balloon’s perceived route, a knowledgeable chase crew  can assist in the execution of the flight and play a large role  in flight safety and management.  

Immediately after the launch, the crew should promptly load  equipment and prepare to leave the launch field. At a large  fun fly of local pilots, or perhaps a competitive event, there  may be a temptation for the crew to remain on the field and  socialize; a crew on the field is of little or no use to a pilot  who may be in difficulty. The crew chief, in conjunction with  the pilot, should have a planned route off the launch site and  a methodology for conducting the chase. Some pilots prefer  for the chase crew to be ahead of the balloon, while other  pilots have the chase crew follow the balloon throughout  the entire flight. This is a matter of personal preference and  may have an impact on the comfort level of the pilot. Either  way is acceptable, as long as the pilot and crew remain in  contact, and there is a plan in place for the eventual recovery  of the balloon.  

Chasing the balloon is, at times, grossly oversimplified. The  crew should always bear in mind that they may have to plan  on how to be in one of two places at any given moment:  where the balloon currently is and where it appears to be  heading in the next few minutes. A good rule during the first  half of the planned flight is to leapfrog ahead of the balloon,  let the balloon catch up, and then repeat the process. Even  in familiar flying areas, the crew should frequently check  maps to determine the flightpath, likely landing areas, and  the best routes to get there. The crew must constantly be  aware of changing conditions that may affect the flight; winds  increasing, decreasing, or changing directions, or perhaps  traffic situations that affect how the crew gets to the balloon  after landing.  

# Crew Behavior  

During the chase, the crew should remember to drive  legally and politely. Driving at high rates of speed with no  justification creates a sense of emergency where there is not  one, and can draw unwanted attention to the chase crew. The  chase crew is useless to the pilot if they have been stopped  by the authorities.  

While chasing, the crew should observe all “No Trespassing”  and “Keep Out” signs, and stay on public, paved roads.  Vehicular trespass is common and the laws are very restrictive  regarding vehicles on private property. Pilots and their chase  crews should adhere to local trespass laws.  

If possible, the chase crew should try to keep the chase vehicle  in sight of the balloon. The pilot needs to know the crew is  nearby and not stuck in a ditch or off somewhere changing a  flat tire. When the vehicle is stopped at the side of the road,  park it so the entire vehicle is visible to the balloon pilot.  

# Pilot/Crew Communications  

Radio communications between the balloon and the chase  vehicle are fairly common. If radios are used, obey all Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Use call  signs, proper language, and keep transmissions short. Many  balloonists prefer not to use radios to communicate with their  chase vehicle because it can be distracting to both pilot and  chase vehicle driver. In any case, it is a good idea to agree  on a common phone number before a flight in case the chase  crew loses the balloon.  [Figure 7-13]  

![](images/67e1dbcb494054a56224247a524b7a59ce450019ee3b37d29c0ec5a21fb984b2.jpg)  
Figure 7-13   This crew chief has stopped safely off the road to  talk to her pilot. Communications are important, but safety is  paramount.  

# Use of a Very High Frequency (VHF) Radio  

There is confusion among pilots regarding frequencies that  may be used from air-to-ground, balloon-to-chase crew, for  instance. Many balloonists use 123.3 and 123.5 for air-to- ground (pilot-to-chase crew), as these frequencies are for  glider schools and not many soaring planes are in the air  at sunrise. Since all users of the airwaves must have an ID  or call, ground crews may identify themselves by adding  “chase” to the aircraft call sign. For example, the chase call  for “Balloon 3584 Golf” would be “3584 Golf Chase,” or  perhaps simply “84 Golf Chase.”  

The air-to-air frequency is 122.75. Remember that everyone  in the air is using this frequency; transmissions should be  kept brief. A balloon pilot trying to contact a circling airplane  would try 122.75 first.  

Weather information is available on VHF radio. A balloon  pilot could obtain nearby weather reports by tuning to  the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). The  appropriate frequency is listed on the cover of the sectional  chart and in the airport information block printed on the chart  near the appropriate airport.  

# Landowner Relations  

# Identiﬁcation of Animal Populations  

Balloonists must learn how to locate and identify animals on  the ground. Even though it may be legal to fly at a certain  low altitude, animals do not know the laws—nor do most of  their owners. If a pilot causes dogs to bark, turkeys to panic,  or horses to run, even while flying legally, it may provide  legitimate cause for complaint.  

Horses and ponies can be anywhere from the smallest  paddock and roughest fields to the largest pasture. Boarding  stables and breeding farms are easily identified by their  painted wooden fences, stacked bales of hay and straw, and  horse trailers. Assume all horses are valuable: race horses,  breeders, and those privately boarded. While horses generally  behave the same way when frightened, each one’s alarm level  differs. Anything from the glow of the back-up burner to the  balloon’s shadow can spook them. In a pasture, they may  buck, neigh, or even charge; in extreme cases, they might try  to jump the fence and may injure themselves. As horses are  accustomed to hearing human voices, talking to them may  help calm them down.  [Figure 7-14]  

![](images/7d9d2f27da048d5abe51a9bdce10fc920a684e975b7dea6601d392775436fb74.jpg)  
Figure 7-14   Flight in areas of horse activity requires caution and  consideration.  

Cattle need more space than horses, about one acre per cow.  Dairy cows tend to stay near the barn; corn near the pasture  and a muddy yard usually means milk production. If they  are out in more remote pastures, they are probably beef  producers. When startled, cattle usually bunch together to  face a threat but can just as easily panic and run. A stampede  can break down a fence or locked gate. Once out, cattle can  be herded by driving them from behind where they need  to go by blocking sideways means of escape (with people  or vehicles). Brood cows can be unpredictable, especially  during breeding, and are capable of damaging a truck. As  with horses, the sound of human voices may help calm cattle.  [Figure 7-15]  

![](images/7de61ab62dab6f1c5b5a7f9a3c5532cbbf2417596bb750e0ce52ea20d2b0d4c4.jpg)  
Figure 7-15   While cattle in a field may appear undisturbed, they  can spook and stampede at the least provocation.  

Pigs are perhaps the most difficult livestock for farmers  to raise. Easily disturbed, it is best to avoid them at all  costs. When frightened, they bunch together and bolt, and  are virtually unstoppable, almost impossible to catch, and  potentially dangerous (especially boars). Pigs run until  they are exhausted; rounding them up can take days. Pork  prices fluctuate dramatically, and monetary claims against  a balloonist who upsets pigs can be quite high.  

Poultry (chickens and turkeys) are more often raised in  confinement buildings than free range. A long windowless  building with fans on the ends and atop the roof usually  indicates a poultry production facility. With the lights and  fans off, tens of thousands of birds can be amazingly quiet.  Any disruption of this tightly controlled environment,  however, can severely affect production. A sudden blast  of a balloon’s burner can start an all-out panic; birds trying  to flock in a confined space trample and crush each other,  leading to mass-scale suffocation. Ducks and geese raised  outside average about 200 birds per pen. When panicked, they  also tend to flock which can lead to injury and death.  

Livestock will appear along a balloon’s flightpath, as well  as landing sites. Follow these livestock tips to minimize  disruptions during these encounters:  

•  Always watch for signs of livestock: barns, sheds,  silos, fences, muck heaps, tractors, trailers, stacked  bales of straw and hay, and mudded areas all point to  some form of livestock nearby.  

•  Stay away from barns and building clusters – livestock  are most likely inside or nearby.

 •  Livestock are most active in the morning and early  evening. When hot, they seek shade near buildings  or under trees. When cold, they gather together to  conserve heat and seek shelter from wind anywhere.

 •  Livestock breaking out of their field or enclosures  as the balloon flies by demands immediate attention.  A cow in the road can total a car; the driver will not  do well either. The chase crew should either find the  farmer or take steps to contain or protect the livestock  without endangering themselves. 

 •  The sound of a human voice can often calm agitated  or frightened livestock—talk to them. Use calm and  easy tones.

 •  Horses with riders warrant particular caution. A highly  visible wave from the basket to the rider acknowledges  their presence and says that all possible care is being  taken.  

# Chapter Summary  

As with the previous chapter, this chapter explains techniques  and procedures that have come to be generally accepted  throughout most of the ballooning community. They are by  no means an exhaustive explanation of “how to fly.” Some of  the procedures may seem unduly complex, but with practice  and experience, these maneuvers come naturally.  

A good pilot observes other pilots and incorporates techniques  that are safe and acceptable. New pilots sometimes fly with  different instructors, in order to gain a perspective on “how  the other guy does it”; other, more experienced pilots fly with  another commercial pilot during a flight review. Almost all  flight methodology, as long as it is safely conducted, and with  a plan and purpose behind it, is acceptable for use as long as  the performance requirements of the PTS can be met.

# Chapter 8 Landing  and Recovery  

# Introduction  

No other aircraft has as many different types of landings as  a balloon. Rarely are two landings in a balloon the same,  and each has its own unique characteristics. The prime  consideration in any balloon landing is the safety of the pilot  and passengers. While accessibility, ease of recovery, and  possible damage to the balloon are certainly considerations  in any balloon landing, these do not override the simple fact  that preventing injury to occupants must be the primary goal  of any balloon pilot.  

Accident statistics indicate that the landing sequence is the  portion of flight in which the most injuries occur.  

# The Approach  

An axiom of ballooning is “the best altitude for landing is  the lowest altitude.” Anyone can land from one foot above  the ground; it takes skill to land from 100 feet. The pilot’s  ultimate goal in making the approach is to set himself up to  make a smooth, gentle landing in the best possible location  without causing damage to the balloon or injury to the  passengers.  

Conventional wisdom indicates three types of approaches  to landing in ballooning—stair step, straight line, and steep  (previously discussed in Chapter 7, Inflight Maneuvers).  In reality, the stair step and straight line approaches are  considered the same type of approach, a controlled approach,  while the steep approach is viewed as an accelerated  approach. Any approach is considered to be a variation of  one of these two or perhaps a combination.  

Of more importance, and a point frequently missed by  newer or inexperienced pilots, is that the approach is being  performed in two different planes or dimensions. Pilots are  accustomed to thinking of the approach in vertical terms, but  frequently discount the fact that the approach is also being  performed on the horizontal plane.  

Refer to  Figure 8-1.  This is the approach path to the selected  landing site for this pilot. Most pilots presume that this  will happen after making a determination of lower level  winds, evaluating obstacle clearance, noting the presence  of powerlines, and making the decision to commit to the  landing. After that, the primary focus becomes making  the descent without further consideration of the lateral or  horizontal movement.  

In  Figure 8-2,  the pilot has determined the winds below, and  has set up for the same approach ensuring obstacle clearance,  powerline considerations, and making the commitment to  land. The difference here is that the pilot has a higher level  

![](images/ca47b60e25c7dadf205ca5b1ca7396447ebb60821ef8cc6afb4be5860c443aa7.jpg)

Figure 8-2.   The horizontal plane’s “reality” approach to landing.  

of situational awareness and understands the horizontal  component, and therefore begins the approach with many  more options available. In this example, if the pilot is tending  more towards the road, he or she can “extend” the approach  to remain in more favorable winds, and then continue the  descent when the turn is more advantageous to the landing.  

The vertical component of the landing profile is represented  in  Figure 8-3.  This may be referred to as a “natural” descent  profile. For example, the pilot may see a large field in the  distance ahead and elect to initiate a shallow or low profile  approach. The pilot would let the balloon cool naturally until  it reached the point depicted as Point A in  Figure 8-3.  A  normal descent rate at that point would project the balloon  out on a line tangent with the descent curve at that moment.  From that point, the pilot must maintain that line much like  the control necessary for contour flying.  

If, however, the winds are somewhat lighter or the landing  site is tight, conducting the approach from Point B,  Figure 8-3 might be more appropriate. Again, the pilot should wait until  the tangent of the descent curve aligns with the targeted  

![](images/c3ebd3f4be963c19ea7d75c33ac197849eb43a5e8fc48817d078d532660c0de1.jpg)

landing site. At that point, the pilot should make a half burn  and the balloon will follow the desired path.  

As a final illustration, steep descents, as previously discussed  in Chapter 7, are usually initiated and controlled from the point  or area depicted as C in  Figure 8-3.  The pilot must take both  planes of movement, the horizontal as well as the vertical,  into consideration when making the approach.  

Again, the balloon pilot must visualize the landing by  imagining the path through the air and across the ground.  Constant scanning in all directions while on the desired  approach is imperative. Target fixation can cause a pilot to  miss potentially dangerous objects or situations. Look for  obstacles, especially powerlines, near the imagined track.  Note surface wind velocity and direction by looking for  smoke, dust, flags, moving trees, and anything else that  indicates wind direction. Do not be influenced too much by  a wind indicator at a distance from the proposed site if there  is a good indicator closer.  

As an example, imagine flying level at 700 feet above ground  level (AGL) and it is time to land. Checking the fuel, there  is 30 percent remaining in each of the two 20-gallon tanks.  The balloon’s track across the ground is toward the southeast,  but a farmer’s tractor is observed making a column of dust  that is traveling nearly due east. The dust cloud rises from  the ground at about a  $45^{\circ}$   angle. From this information, it is  believed that the balloon turns left as it descends. This means  the pilot is looking to the left of the line the balloon now  travels. By dropping small tissue balls, the pilot determines  that the wind changes about halfway to the ground and  continues to turn left about  $45^{\circ}$  . As an initial plan, visualize  the descent being no faster than about 500 feet per minute  (fpm) initially and slowing to about  $300\,\mathrm{fpm}$   about 400 feet  AGL where the turn to the left can be expected. Because  the balloon loses some lift from the cooling effect of the  wind direction change, the rate of descent should be closely  monitored during the turn.  

With this imagined descent in mind, the pilot searches for an  appropriate landing site. The next fallow field to the left of the  present track is blocked by tall powerlines. The landing site is  rejected as unsuitable. The next field that seems appropriate  is an unfenced grain stubble field bordered by dirt roads with  a 30-foot high power line turning along the west side to the  left and parallel to the balloon’s present track. Under the  powerlines is a paved road with a row crop of sugar beets to  the right and directly in the balloon’s ground track.  

The pilot selects a landing site at the intersection of the two  dirt roads at the southeast corner of the field. The planned  path would be across the field diagonally giving the greatest  distance from the powerlines. Extending the final approach  line back over the powerlines and into the sugar beet field,  the pilot selects a point where the balloon is likely to begin  its surface wind turn. Then, reverse planning from that point,  a point should be determined in order to begin the initial  descent.  

Now, the balloon pilot performs the descent, turn, and landing  that is visualized. If all goes as planned, the balloon cools  and accelerates to about   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  . The pilot applies some  heat to arrest the descent while approaching the imagined  turning point over the beets, levels off (or actually climbs  a bit) while crossing over the power lines (about 100 feet  above), and allows the balloon to cool again while setting  up another descent across the stubble field. Due to the seven  mile per hour (mph) estimated wind, the pilot allows the  basket to touch down about 150 feet away from the dirt road  intersection to lose some momentum as the basket bounces  and skids over to the road, just as planned.  

Imagine, how the landing might have occurred not knowing  the surface wind was different from that of the flight path.  Perhaps a less considerate pilot would plan on landing in the  beets, believing the crop would not be hurt and the farmer  would not care. Unfortunately, the balloon turns unexpectedly  toward the power lines, causing the pilot to make several  burns of undetermined amount, setting up a climb that  prevents the pilot from landing on the dirt road. The road  is directly in line with the balloon’s track but disappearing  behind the balloon. Another good landing site becomes  unusable because of the lack of planning.  

The prudent pilot makes a nice landing on a dirt road with  25 percent fuel remaining, while the unprepared pilot dives,  turns, climbs, and is now back at 600 feet in the air looking  for another landing site. For the next attempt, the pilot has less  fuel and is under more pressure, all because of not noticing  the power lines to the left and not checking the wind on the  ground before making the descent.  

# Step-Down Approach  

The step-down approach method involves varying descent  rates. This procedure is used to determine lower level wind  velocities and directions so that options may be considered  until beginning the final descent phase to landing. There  are other methods to evaluate lower level wind conditions,  such as dropping strips of paper, small balloons, etc. While  the descent path can be varied and sometimes quite shallow,  it is important to avoid long, level flight segments below  minimum safe altitudes without intending to land. Level flight  at low altitudes could lead an observer to believe that the pilot  has discontinued the approach and established level flight at  less than a minimum safe altitude.  [Figure 8-4]  

# Low Approach  

The second type of approach is a low or shallow approach. If  there are no obstacles between the balloon and the proposed  landing site, a low or shallow approach allows a pilot to check  the wind closer to the surface. The closer the balloon is to the  surface, the easier it is to land. Low approaches are suitable  in open areas with a wide field of view and few obstacles.  

# Obstacles and Approach Angles  

Most good landing areas are not very large and generally have  obstacles somewhere close by. The classic approach requires  the balloon pilot to fly the balloon at a descent angle that clears  the highest obstacle in its path to the intended landing site.  However, if the pilot allows the balloon to descend below  that angle, a rapid adjustment of that angle is necessary to  avoid the top of the obstacle. In many cases, the attempt to  miss an obstacle by a close margin may result in a period of  overcontrolling or excessive burns and vents.  

![](images/3acaf4d9c367656fc01c03396a69311282caa5527db4ba26f411cfc99556937c.jpg)  
Figure 8-4.   The step-down approach.  

![](images/5a6a800f1fd34ebdcfe885f342be5539b897955aa966f9f1a5e83d2934ef55e1.jpg)  
Figure 8-5.   In this approach, the pilot has elected to clear the obstacle at a minimal distance. Any overcontrol after Point A is likely to  send the balloon past the intended landing area, and a very close clearance will be necessary over the obstacle at Point B in order to  preserve the desired approach angle.  

The inexperienced pilot usually misses the intended landing  site and is forced to find another or has an undesirably hard  landing, if the pilot manages to make the landing site. See  Figure 8-5  for an illustration of this effect.  

This type of approach is helpful by keeping the intended  landing area in focus so that the descent results in the balloon  touching down precisely where intended. Benefits to this  methodology are straight line control and immediate visual  feedback from the landing site. The disadvantage of using  this specific methodology is that, again, any deviation from  the depicted flight path may result in overcontrol or, at best,  a “close shave” over the obstacle at Point B to preserve the  approach.  

Figure 8-6  illustrates the same vertical profile but with a  few subtle and important differences. The initial approach  is identical, but the initial target is different. Rather than  focusing on the landing site past the barn requiring a clearance  of two or three feet, this pilot has elected to “aim” for a point  of safe obstacle clearance of the barn (about ten feet above the  silo), knowing that a short vent on the other side “sharpens”  the descent. It is clear that the balloon drops into the landing  site somewhat closer to the obstacle, the conscientious pilot  having already evaluated that possibility prior to committing  to the landing. This methodology minimizes the possibility  of overcontrolling and dramatically increases the chances of  a successful landing.  

![](images/f7384b240bd35bab0054169fb6cadd59f27c3e346a4463b002850e093f9e5a7d.jpg)  
Figure 8-6.   This approach is virtually the same as the one in Figure 8-5, but with subtle differences. In this case, the pilot has aimed for  a location above the obstacle at Point B with appropriate obstacle clearance. Minor deviations after Point A on the approach path, if  compensated for, still allow the pilot to make the intended landing area.  

T o summarize, if there is an obstacle between the balloon and  the landing site, the following are the three safe choices.  

1.  Give the obstacle appropriate clearance and drop in  from altitude. 2.  Reject the landing and look for another landing site. 3.  Fly a low approach to the obstacle, fly over the  obstacle allowing plenty of room, and then make the  landing.  

The first choice is the most difficult, requiring landing from  a high approach and then a fast descent at low altitude.  The second choice is the most conservative, but may not  be available if the pilot is approaching the last landing site.  The third choice is preferable. Flying toward the site at  low altitude provides an opportunity to check the surface  winds. By clearing the obstacle while ascending—always  the safest option—the pilot ends up with a short, but not too  high, approach.  

# Some Basic Rules of Landing  

When a landing site is being considered, a balloon pilot  should first think about the suitability of the site. “Is it safe,  is it legal, and is it polite?”  

Plan the landing early enough so that fuel quantity is not a  distraction. Always plan on landing with enough fuel so that  even if the first approach to a landing site is unsuccessful,  there is enough fuel to make a couple more approaches.  

The best landing site is one that is bigger than the balloon  needs and has alternatives. If the balloon has three prospective  sites in front of it, the pilot should aim for the one in the  middle in case the surface wind estimate was off. If the  balloon has multiple prospective landing sites in a row along  its path, the pilot should take the first one and save the others  for a miscalculation. Unless there is a   $180^{\circ}$   turn available,  all the landing sites behind are lost. Before beginning the  approach, the pilot should plan to fly a reasonable descent  path to the landing site using the step-down approach, the  low (shallow) approach, or a combination of the two.  

# Congested Areas  

Making an approach in a congested area, and subsequently  discovering the site to be impossible or inappropriate, is  another example of a situation in which a pilot could be  falsely accused of low flying. There are some inconsiderate  pilots who fly too low in congested areas without reason,  but they are rare. Every pilot has an occassional aborted  landing situation. According to Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.119, a balloon  may fly closer to the ground than the minimum altitude, if  necessary for landing. For example, during the approach the  balloon turns away from the obviously preferred landing site,  but there is another possible site only one-half mile in the  proper direction. The pilot has two choices: (1) go back up  to a legal altitude and try again, or (2) stay low in the wind  that the balloon pilot is sure will carry the balloon to a good  site and try to make the second landing site.  

In making the first choice, the pilot could be accused of  intentionally flying too low. However, with the second  choice, he or she flies lower for a longer period of time,  which might appear to be a blatant violation of the minimum  altitude regulation. This is not an argument in favor of either  technique. Many pilots prefer the second choice on the “once  the pilot goes down to land, he or she had better land” theory.  [Figure 8-7]  

![](images/b621bc6daaaeac3472442dc2bb747bc8e1005d638557ff713197033571fe7157.jpg)  
Figure 8-7.   A good landing is something to watch.  

# Practice Approaches  

Approaching from a relatively high altitude with a high  descent rate down to a soft landing is a very good maneuver  to practice periodically, regardless of the experience level  of the pilot. This is used when landing over an obstacle  and maneuvering to the selected field is possible only from  a higher than desired altitude. This maneuver can also be  used when, due to inattention or distractions, the pilot is at  a relatively high altitude approaching the last appropriate  landing site. Practicing this type of approach should take  place in an uninhabited area and the obstacle should be a  simulated obstacle.  

A drop-in landing or steep approach to landing is another good  maneuver to practice. Being able to perform this maneuver  can get the balloon into that perfect field that is just beyond  the trees or just the other side of the orchard. A pilot that is  able to drop quickly, but softly, into the fallow field between  crops is more neighborly than making a low approach over  the orchard. Being able to avoid frightening cattle or other  animals during an approach is a valuable skill.  

Having the skill to predict the balloon’s track during the  landing approach, touching down on the intended landing  target, and stopping the balloon basket in the preferred place  can be very satisfying. It requires a sharp eye trained to spot  the indicators of wind direction on the ground. Dropping bits  of tissue, observing other balloons, smoke, steam, dust, and  tree movement are all ways to predict the balloon track on its  way to the landing site. During the approach, one of the pilot’s  most important observations is watching for power lines.  

In ballooning, approaches can be practiced more often than  landings. A good approach usually earns a good landing.  

# Thermal Flight  

The experience of being caught in a thermal can certainly  occur at any altitude, but is more common during the landing  phase of balloon flight. This is primarily due to the balloon’s  proximity to the ground and being exposed to the conditions  that cause thermals.  [Figure 8-8]  

There are indicators of thermal conditions that may be  visible to the pilot, such as “dust devils” or small tornados  visible from the ground. An uncommanded ascent, usually  at a significant climb rate, may be experienced, or perhaps  significant changes in direction. In the extreme, a balloon  caught in a tight (compact) thermal may even create small  horizontal circles in the sky.  

There are two rules to thermal flight. First, the pilot must  continue to fly the balloon. Many pilots are distracted by the  thermal flight experience and may forget that the balloon is  cooling at a faster than normal rate. The pilot should ensure  that the temperature of the balloon’s envelope is kept at or  above that required to maintain normal flight, and under  no circumstance should the pilot allow the balloon to cool.  The temperature noted at equilibrum should be a minimum  temperature to maintain. Additionally, the pilot should not  

![](images/a70234f52901df18c3aed2912309f60ba4d309f349d4580667e2036e32f00cb0.jpg)  
Figure 8-8.   Anatomy of a thermal. A thermal is created by the uneven heating of the surface of the Earth by solar radiation (insolation).  As the sun heats the ground, the ground in turn warms the air above it. Warmer air is less dense, and therefore rises; as it rises, it cools  due to expansion. This heating/cooling pattern sets up a cycle, whereby a downward flow is created outside the thermal column one the  air has cooled to a temperature equal to that of the surrounding air. This can create a hazardous situation for a balloon pilot; the best  action is to maintain buoyancy, and wait for the column to dissipate.  

vent in an effort to descend and land; if the balloon falls out  of the thermal, the pilot may not have sufficient altitude to  recover control.  

The second rule of thermal flight is the axiom, “altitude is  your friend.” Thermals are usually short-lived phenomena  and dissipate after a brief period of time. If the pilot keeps  the balloon at flight temperature, the thermal usually “spits”  the balloon out at a higher altitude. When this happens, the  balloon can again be controlled by the pilot and a safe landing  may be executed.  

# Landings  

# Landing Considerations  

When selecting a landing site, three considerations in order  of importance are: safety of passengers, as well as persons  and property on the ground; landowner relations; and ease  of recovery.  

Some questions the pilot should ask when evaluating a  landing site are:  

•   Is it a safe place for my passengers and the balloon? •   Would my landing create a hazard for any person or  property on the ground? •   Will my presence create any problems (noise, startling  animals, etc.) for the landowner?  

# High-Wind Landing  

When a high-wind landing is likely, the pilot should explain  to the passengers that a high-wind landing follows. It is better  to alert them than allow them to be too casual. Passengers  should be briefed again on the correct posture and procedures  for a high-wind landing, to include wearing gloves and  helmets, if available or required. Some pilots with dual  burner systems elect to leave one burner operational through  the landing process, in the event that heat must be applied to  climb out of a bad approach. This decision should be made  with a view towards the intensity of the impact; a pilot must  also be aware that, instinctively, he or she may grab the burner  handle during a rough landing. This could result in burner  activation, damaging the balloon fabric.  

Depending on the landing speed and surface, open the  deflation vent at the appropriate time to control ground travel.  The passengers should be closely monitored to ensure they are  properly positioned in the basket and holding on tightly.  

Deflate the envelope and monitor it until all the air is  exhausted. Be alert for fire, check the passengers, and prepare  for recovery.  

When faced with a high wind landing, the balloon pilot must  remember that the distance covered during the balloon’s  reaction time is markedly increased. This situation is  somewhat analogous to the driver’s training maxim of “do  not overdrive your headlights.” For example, a balloon  traveling at 5 mph covers a distance of approximately 73  feet in the 10 seconds it takes for the balloon to respond to  a burner input—a distance equal to a semi-truck and trailer  on the road. However, at a speed of   $15~\mathrm{mph}$  , the balloon  covers a distance of 220 feet, or a little more than two-thirds  of a football field. A pilot who is not situationally aware  and fails to recognize hazards and obstacles at an increased  distance may be placed in a dangerous situation with rapidly  dwindling options.  

# Water Landings  

Landing in water requires modification to the passenger  briefing. In a ditching, make sure the passengers get clear of  the basket in case it inverts due to fuel tank placement. Advise  the passengers to keep a strong grip on the basket because it  becomes a flotation device. Predicting the final disposition of  the basket in water is difficult. If the envelope is deflated, the  pilot and passengers can expect the envelope to sink, as it is  heavier than water. Fuel tanks float because they are lighter  than water, even when full. If the envelope retains air, and  depending on fuel-tank configuration, the balloon basket may  come to rest, at least for a while, on its side.  

If the water landing is done on a river, the balloon may be  dragged down river in the current. Generally, staying with  the basket is the best course of action unless the balloon  has landed close to the bank and those aboard are strong  swimmers.  

The pilot should fly at the lowest safe altitude to a large field  and check that the deflation line is clear and ready. Obstacles  should be avoided and the pilot should ideally make an  approach to the near end of the field. When committed to the  landing, brief passengers again, turn off fuel valves, drain  fuel lines, and turn off pilot lights.  

# Passenger Brieﬁngs and Management  

Prior to landing, the pilot should explain correct posture and  procedure to the passengers. Many balloon landings are gentle,  stand-up landings. However, the pilot should always prepare  passengers for the possibility of a firm impact. The prelanding  briefing should instruct passengers to do the following:  

•   Stand in the appropriate area of the basket. •   Face the direction of travel. •   Place feet and knees together, with knees bent. •   “Hold on tight” in two places. •   Stay in the basket.  

# Stand in the Appropriate Area of the Basket  

Passengers and the pilot normally position themselves toward  the rear of the basket.  [Figure 8-9]  This accomplishes three  things.  

1.  The leading edge of the basket is lifted as the floor  tilts from the occupant weight shift, so the basket  is less likely to dig into the ground and tip over  prematurely. 2.  With the occupants in the rear of the basket and the  floor tilted, the basket is more likely to slide along the  ground and lose some speed before tipping.  

![](images/88f4f3c78a14bc935a6a93611df51a57b0b4aa2c6a96bb122f04c4cee7e49ca9.jpg)  
Figure 8-9.   Landing with passengers.  

3.  The passengers are less likely to fall out of the front  of the basket.  

In a high-wind landing, passengers should stand in the front  of the basket because if the basket makes surface contact and  tips over, passengers fall a shorter distance within the basket  and are not pitched forward. They are more likely to remain  in the basket, minimizing the risk of injury.  

# Face the Direction of Travel  

Feet, hips, and shoulders should be perpendicular to the  direction of flight. Impact with the ground while facing the  side puts a sideways strain on the knees and hips, which do  not naturally bend that way. Facing the opposite direction  is more appropriate under certain conditions. Recall the  discussion on passenger briefings on page 6-12.  

# Place Feet and Knees Together, with Knees Bent  

To some people this may not seem to be a natural ready  position; however, it is very appropriate in ballooning. The  feet and knees together stance allows maximum flexibility.  With the knees bent, one can use the legs as springs or shock  absorbers in all four directions. With the feet apart, sideways  flexibility is limited and knees do not bend to the side. With  legs apart fore and aft, one foot in front of the other, there  is the possibility of “doing the splits” and a likelihood of  locking the front knee. Avoid using the word brace as in  “brace yourselves,” as that gives the impression that knees  should be locked or muscles tensed. Legs should be flexible  and springy at landing impact.  

# “Hold On Tight” in Two Places  

This is probably the least followed of the landing instructions.  Up to this point, the typical balloon flight has been relatively  gentle, and most passengers are not mentally prepared for the  shock that can occur when a 7,000 pound balloon contacts  the ground. Passengers should be reminded to hold on tight.  The pilot should advise the passengers of correct places to  hold, whether they are factory-built passenger handles or  places in the balloon’s basket the pilot considers appropriate.  The pilot should obey his or her own directions and also  hold on firmly.  

# Stay in the Basket  

Some passengers, believing the flight is over as soon as  the basket makes contact with the ground, start to get out.  Even a small amount of wind may cause the basket to  bounce and slide after initial touchdown. If a 200-pound  passenger decides to exit the basket at this point, the balloon  immediately begins to ascend. All passengers should stay in  the basket until individually told by the pilot to exit.  

Monitoring of passengers is important because, after the  balloon first touches down, passengers may forget everything  they have been told. A typical response is for the passenger to  place one foot in front of the other and lock the knee. This is  a very bad position as the locked knee is unstable and subject  to damage. Pilots should observe their passengers and order 

 “feet together,” “front (back) of the basket,” “knees bent,” 

 “hold on tight,” and “do not get out until I tell you.” The pilot  should be a good example to passengers by assuming the  correct landing position. Otherwise, passengers may think,  “If the pilot does not do it, why should we.”  

It is very important that the passenger briefing be reinforced  more than once. Some balloon ride companies send an  agreement to their passengers in advance which includes  the landing instructions. Passengers are asked to sign a  statement that they have reviewed, read, and understand the  landing procedure. Many pilots give passengers a briefing  and landing stance demonstration on the ground before the  flight. This briefing should be given again as soon as the  pilot has decided to land.  

The pilot is very busy during the landing—watching the  passenger’s actions and reactions, closing fuel valves,  draining fuel lines, cooling the burners, and deflating  the envelope. The better the passengers understand the  importance of the landing procedure, the better the pilot  performs these duties and makes a safe landing.  

# Recovery  

# Landowner Relations  

The greatest threat to the continued growth of ballooning  is poor landowner relations. The emphasis should be to  create and maintain good relations with those who own and  work the land that balloonists fly over and land on. Balloon  pilots must never forget that, at most landing sites, they are  unexpected visitors. Balloonist may think the uninvited visit  of a balloon is a great gift to individuals on the ground. The  balloon pilot may not know the difference between a valuable  farm crop and uncultivated land. A balloonist may not notice  grazing cattle. A chase vehicle driver may drive fast down  a dirt road, raising unnecessary dust. A crewmember may  trample a valuable crop.  

There are several situations where a balloon pilot or crew  may anger the public. When people are angered, they demand  action from the local police, county sheriff, Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), or an attorney. The FAA does not  initiate an investigation without a complaint. The balloonist  is the one who initiates a landowner relations problem.  

A balloonist can ease the effect he or she has on people on  the ground. First, the pilot should develop skills to allow the  widest possible selection of landing sites. The pilot should  ensure that the crew is trained to respect the land, obey traffic  laws, and be polite to everyone they come in contact with.  The crew should always get permission for the balloon to  land and the chase vehicle to enter private property.  

Each pilot should learn the trespass laws of his or her home  area. In some states, it is very difficult for the balloon pilot  and passengers to trespass, but very easy for the chase vehicle  and crew to trespass. If the balloon lands on the wrong side of  a locked gate or fence, the first thing the chase crew should  do is try to find the landowner or resident to get permission  to enter. If no one can be found, it may be necessary to carry  the balloon and lift it over the fence.  

Do not cut or knock down fences, as it is probably considered  trespassing. In some places, even the possession of fence- cutting and fence-repairing tools may be interpreted as  possession of burglary tools, creating liabilities. Pilot and  crew should have a clear understanding of what is acceptable  and what is not acceptable.  

Sometimes local law enforcement officials arrive at the scene  of a balloon landing site. Someone may have called them or  they may have seen the balloon in the air. They may just be  interested in watching the balloon (which is usually the case),  or they may think a violation of the law has occurred. If law  enforcement officials approach the balloon, the pilot should  always be polite. Most emergency responders probably do not  know much about federal law regarding aviation. However,  even if they are wrong and the pilot knows they are wrong,  there is no point in antagonizing them with a belligerent  attitude. It is better to listen than to end up in court.  

There is a wealth of information on landowner relations issues  available from the Balloon Federation of America (BFA), as  well as the British Balloon and Airship Club (BBAC). The  BBAC web site, www.bbac.org, has an excellent video that  was produced solely to deal with the issues of landowner  relations in the United Kingdom. Despite being tailored for  that country, it is worth viewing by the pilot and crew in the  United States.  

# Packing the Balloon  

After the crew has obtained the necessary landowner clearance  to enter the landing site, the process of packing the balloon  begins. Despite being the end of the flight, many pilots, as well  as crew, consider this the point when the real work begins.  

Deflating the balloon is the reverse of the inflation process.  The crewmember designated to handle the crown line should  secure the free end of the crown line and move downwind.  The pilot should turn off the burner’s pilot light and main  fuel valves on the fuel tanks, and vent the fuel system. Once  the fuel system has been shut off, and there is no risk of  fire, the vent line can be activated to start the deflation. The  crown line crewperson pulls on the crown line to assist in  the deflation process and to help lay the balloon out in the  desired direction. The pilot and crew should remember that  it is virtually impossible to lay a balloon down against the  wind. Other crewmembers may be stationed on the sides  to keep fabric from draping over trees, bushes, and assist  the balloon in coming down. Once the envelope is on its  side, the crown line crewmember may move to the top of  the balloon, and maintain slight tension on the load ring in  order to continue the deflation. This crewmember should be  reminded to leave gloves on, as the load ring is hot and may  take some time to cool.  

At this point, the balloon is ready to be “walked out,” or  “squeezed,” meaning that the remaining air in the balloon  is removed in preparation for repacking the envelope in the  appropriate bag. The most common method is for the pilot or  a crewmember to gather the envelope together at the throat,  and, keeping their arms around the fabric, walk towards the  top of the envelope squeezing the air out as they go. There is  ample opportunity during this process to injure one’s back.  The person walking the envelope out should take care to not  put excessive strain on their lower back during this process.  There are some mechanical devices available to help in this  process, and some pilots elect to use one of these, rather than  put an individual’s well being at risk.  [Figure 8-10]  

![](images/4b58ad43af7f76a66e36bad4c1f92633aee0006c19f28b6fa02bf024ac4c957f.jpg)  
Figure 8-10.   Walking the balloon out with a “Squeeze-EZ.”  

After the envelope is walked out and the crown line is  secured, either in a separate bag or by folding it in half  down the length of the envelope (which prevents tangling),  the envelope is ready to be packed in its bag. The envelope  bag, regardless of manufacturer, has a “flap” of fabric across  the top. Some pilots prefer to pack the envelope so the flap  is towards the balloon, while others prefer that the flap be  away from the balloon. At first glance, this appears to be a  random choice but there is sound reasoning behind it. If the  balloon is usually launched from grassy, smooth fields, then  it would be normal to have the flap away from the balloon.  If, however, the balloon is laid out for inflation in areas  with rocks, stubble, and other objects which may potentially  damage the envelope, it is an accepted practice to pack the  balloon with the envelope flap facing towards the balloon.  Then, when the balloon is laid out on the next flight, it passes  over the flap before contact with the ground and minimizes  the risk of damage.  [Figure 8-11]  

![](images/ea74f2c589097824ebdb830a641ddcdc308e9d5699cb9fd1f3fc6be731945139.jpg)  
Figure 8-11.   Packing the balloon. This pilot has elected to position  the envelope bag near the basket and is bringing the balloon to the  bag, rather than picking up the bag each time to move it towards  the basket. Some pilots prefer this method, as it means less lifting  for the crew.  

Crewmembers should be stationed on opposite sides of the  bag at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle to the balloon. The pilot or designated  crewmember lifts a section of the balloon and, with the  crewmembers lifting the bag and bringing it to the envelope,  place it in the envelope bag. This process continues until the  envelope is almost completely packed and only the suspension  cables are out. The suspension system is removed from the  basket superstructure and secured, and placed in the envelope  bag. The bag is closed and loaded on the chase vehicle.  

Actions at this point are performed in the reverse order of the  layout procedure. Generally, the envelope is secured onto the  chase vehicle, the basket and burners are disassembled and  secured on the vehicle, and a final check of the landing site  is made to ensure that no loose items are left at the landing  site. A final check with the landowner is usually appropriate.  After a quick “thank you,” the flight is officially “one for  the books.”  

# Refueling  

Most pilots choose to refuel as soon after a flight as possible.  This is probably appropriate for most circumstances, as this  is one less issue to resolve when the time comes for the next  flight.  [Figure 8-12]  

![](images/8fd9a62dc6de9cf43556396ed0b3b642bb693675e6899fbe23c41c10e7d1ff74.jpg)  
Figure 8-12.   Refueling. Note that this pilot is exercising safety  precautions with sleeves down and gloves on.  

Each balloon has its own refueling procedures, which may  be found in the appropriate flight manual for that balloon.  Refueling involves connecting a supply line to the balloon’s  fuel lines, opening the refueling tank’s main valve, opening a  fixed liquid level gauge (“spit” valve) on the respective fuel  tank in the balloon basket, and then opening the main supply  valve on that tank. When the fixed liquid level gauge begins  to “spit” liquid propane, the tank is full. Shut off the main tank  valve first, then close the “spit valve,” then close the main  supply line, and then bleed the lines. This is a generalized  description of the process; under all circumstances, the pilot  should follow the procedure as outlined in the balloon’s  flight manual.  

Safety during refueling is of paramount importance. While  specific refueling procedures may vary, safety procedures do  not. Propane vapor is a highly flammable and, under certain  circumstances, explosive gas. There are many instances of  accidents during refueling that have resulted in property  damage, personal injury, and even death. The following  safety rules serve the balloon pilot well to remember:  

•  No smoking around the balloon while refueling. This  is an absolute. •  Never conduct refueling procedures from inside the  basket.  •  Disable strikers in the basket. Turn off cell phones  and pagers. Synthetic clothing may also provide a  source of ignition (static electricity) under certain  circumstances.  •  The chase vehicle should be shut off. Do not leave  the engine running during the refuel process. In larger  chase vehicles, such as RV conversions, water heater  pilot lights must be shut off.  •  Persons conducting the refueling should wear gloves  at all times, preferably loose ones that can be removed  quickly. •  Never refuel inside a closed trailer or inside a van. The  vapor can quickly build up to a potentially combustible  level. The basket should be moved to open air, as  propane vapor is heavier than air.  

For further safety recommendations, a pilot should consult  with the propane supplier or see the appropriate section of the  Hot Air Balloon Crewing Essentials  publication previously  cited in this handbook.  

# Logging of Flight Time  

At some time subsequent to the flight, it is necessary for the  pilot to make entries regarding the flight in their personal  logbook, as well as the aircraft’s logbook. It is an accepted  practice in aviation that flight time is logged in tenths of  a hour, as opposed to using hours and minutes. A tenth of  an hour is represented by a 6-minute increment; remaining  minutes are rounded up. This practice is used for both  individuals and aircraft.  

# Pilot’s Log  

A pilot’s flight time is required to be logged under the  provisions of 14 CFR section 61.51. That section states, in  part, that …“(1) Each person must document and record the  following time…(a) training and aeronautical experience used  to meet the requirements for a certificate, rating, or flight  review of this part. (2) The aeronautical experience required for  meeting the recent flight experience requirements of this part.”  (in this case, referring to currency requirements as stipulated  under section 61.57) This is a relatively simple requirement  and usually does not present issues for the pilot.  

There are certain definitions relating to solo time, pilot  in command (PIC) time, and instruction time, which are  explained within the regulation. Pilots are advised that since  they alone are responsible for maintaining the log books,  knowledge of these definitions is necessary. Reviewing  section 61.51 is appropriate. Should questions arise, a pilot  should consult with the local Flight Standards District Office  (FSDO) for interpretation.  

# Aircraft Log Books  

14 CFR section 91.417 addresses the requirement for aircraft  maintenance records (commonly referred to as a log book),  and what the record must contain. All time recorded on the  aircraft must be reflected in the maintenance record, and it  is the responsibility of the owner or operator of the aircraft  to ensure that the records are correctly maintained.  

Flight time in a balloon is defined as that time beginning  when the balloon is first made buoyant and lasts until the  balloon is deflated. Balloons do not have a hour meter, as an  airplane or other aircraft does, and the pilot must consider  the fact that burner activation on inflation would equate to  an engine start on an airplane.  [Figure 8-13]  

![](images/ba3a699268bb4e14abf078bd4b27becfbef92bc8177f1079ae03c2c68095d834.jpg)  
Figure 8-13.   Aircraft log books or maintenance records are for  aircraft time and not for passenger names and flight experiences.  

There are some pilots who do not, for whatever reason, record  aircraft time conducted while on tether. This is an incorrect  practice. A balloon on tether is in flight, or more precisely,  in a flight configuration, and conducting operations under  the provisions of part 91. All inflated time of a certificated  balloon should be noted in the maintenance records to ensure  that inspection times are met.  

# Crew Responsibilities  

The general theory regarding expectations of crew help at  landing is if the pilot cannot land the balloon without help, he  or she should not be flying. It is not always possible for the  chase crew to be at the landing site, so plan to land without  assistance.  

Most balloon pilots have strong opinions regarding whether or  not the crew must be present for a landing. Those who do not  see a need for crew to be present have some solid reasons.  

•  It is not always possible for crew to be there. Traffic,  wrong turns, and pilot decisions to land early or fly  on can thwart their best efforts. •  With no formal training, enthusiastic crew might  interfere with the landing or do the wrong thing and  create a problem where none would have existed.  •  Crew racing to every potential landing site may drive  inconsiderately and even recklessly, endangering  everyone on the road and creating a poor impression  for ballooning.  

Pilots who favor crew being on hand have a number of equally  convincing arguments.  

•  In any branch of aviation, takeoff and landing are  the most critical maneuvers. In ballooning, landing  is number one. The vast majority of ballooning  accidents and injuries occur on landing. A mistake  during inflation or launch usually means calling a  repair station; burned throat fabric is the leading  repair nationwide. A mistake during landing often  means calling the insurance agent. One insurance  survey found accidents involving bodily injury on hard  landings occur twice as often as damage to equipment  or even power line strikes. This trend clearly identifies  a need to improve safety at the end of every flight. •  The leading factor in accidents is wind. Highly  variable surface winds often speed up, slow down,  stop, turn, and even go backward. Crew onsite can  radio the pilot regarding surface wind speeds and  directions prior to landing, which factor into landing  at a particular site, if at all. •  Landing approaches put the balloon at its closest to  power lines, trees, buildings, and the ground. Potential  risks increase, and the closest first responders able to  handle the balloon and trouble are most likely to be  the crew. •  When flying low or into the sun, a pilot may not  see hidden power lines, antennas, or other obstacles  which crew can easily spot while assessing the landing  site. •  Crew can confirm the quality of a landing site. From  a distance, a pilot cannot see what may rule the site  out: livestock gathered under a tree, standing water,  

a newly planted crop, another balloon deflating in the  field, etc. The crew may find a site the pilot might not  have seen from the air.  

•  Many pilots ask crew to get landowner permission  before committing to a site or actually landing. This  is often a crew’s top priority. Finding the landowner  can take a few minutes; one crewmember can do  this while another walks out to assist the pilot. If it  is a “no,” time and fuel might have been better spent  searching for the next suitable option.

 •  Landings create a workload challenge for the pilot.  Consider all the tasks in the seconds before and after  landing: flying the balloon, making an approach,  briefing passengers, watching for obstacles, bracing  for landing, deciding to move closer to a road or  driveway, shutting down tanks, bleeding fuel lines,  radioing crew, directing passenger unloading,  deflating the envelope, keeping the envelope off  obstacles, dealing with a hostile landowner or dog, and  more. A single oversight, distraction, or poor decision  can compromise safety. Extra hands may be required  to protect everyone onboard and on the ground

 •  Crew serve as a pilot’s redundancy and work to  minimize flight risks of any nature. The FAA and  every balloon manufacturer know the safety value  of redundancy and the greatest risks (accidents and  injuries) come at landing. There is no better time  for crew to promote safety than in the flight’s last  minutes.  

visible from the air, with no obstacles, and perfect as is—early  in the flight. Conditions are often smooth enough for safe  landings. An unassisted landing often gives the pilot a better  feel for the balloon’s equilibrium. Letting the ground absorb  the balloon’s energy by touching and/or dragging might  be the safest option of all. The landowner might greet the  pilot in person even before the crew arrives, and passengers  may have equipment disassembled and packed before the  crew arrives. Many of these conditions frequently occur. A  thoroughly prepared crew is one that is trained and ready for  the many occasions that they are needed.  

# Chapter Summary  

Among the many adages in aviation is “takeoffs are optional,  landings are mandatory.” For every flight, there must be a  landing, and the balloon pilot should be prepared to execute  a landing with skill and precision at any time during the  flight.  

In the early days of ballooning, it was common to see pilots  “stick” the balloon (execute a hard landing) on a routine  basis as burner systems were generally inadequate to slow  the balloon during a rapid descent. With newer systems,  the balloon can be better controlled and a smooth, graceful  landing is a routine result, provided the pilot has planned  ahead and understands the mechanics and concepts of the  landing process. The information contained here is by no  means all inclusive, but illustrates certain methodologies to  good landing techniques.  

While crew-assisted landings may make some pilots  uncomfortable, the reality is they happen all the time. This  crew role can perhaps have more impact on flight safety than  any regulation, equipment, or technique, provided the pilot  and crew decide this before the flight.  

Sometimes the best landing assistance may be none at all.  Every pilot is trained to land without help from their crew.  The balloon pilot may have chosen a landing site—fully  

# Aeromedical  Factors  

# Introduction  

As a pilot, it is important to stay aware of the psychological  and physical standards required for the type of flying  performed. This chapter provides information on medical  certification and on aeromedical factors related to flying  activities.  

Most pilots must have a valid medical certificate to exercise  the privileges of their airman certificates. Balloon pilots are  not required to hold a medical certificate.  

Some operations conducted outside the United States may  require the balloon pilot to have a medical certificate. For  example, United States certificated balloon pilots participating  in events in Canada may be required to carry a second class  medical certificate in order to carry passengers. In this case,  it would be wise to check with the appropriate authorities to  determine the requirements for specific operations. Title 14  of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61 covers  medical certification of pilots. Aviation medical examiners  (AMEs) may be found by using a local telephone book, or  contacting the local Flight Service District Office (FSDO).  

# Environmental and Health Factors  Affecting Pilot Performance  

A number of health factors and physiological effects can be  linked to flying. Some are minor, while others are important  enough to require special consideration to ensure safety of  flight. In some cases, physiological factors can lead to in- flight emergencies. Some important medical factors that a  pilot should be aware of include hypoxia, hyperventilation,  middle ear and sinus problems, motion sickness, stress and  fatigue, dehydration, and heatstroke. Other subjects include  the effects of alcohol and drugs, anxiety, and excess nitrogen  in the blood after scuba diving.  

# Hypoxia  

Hypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough oxygen.”  Although any tissue will die if deprived of oxygen long  enough, the main concern is usually with getting enough  oxygen to the brain, since it is particularly vulnerable to  oxygen deprivation. Any reduction in mental function while  flying can result in life-threatening errors. Hypoxia can be  caused by several factors, including an insufficient supply of  oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability  of the body tissues to use oxygen. Four forms of hypoxia  based on their causes are: hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia,  stagnant hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia.  

# Hypoxic Hypoxia  

Hypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen available  to the body as a whole. A blocked airway and drowning are  obvious examples of how the lungs can be deprived of oxygen,  but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude  is an appropriate example for pilots. Although the percentage  of oxygen in the atmosphere is constant, its partial pressure  decreases proportionately as atmospheric pressure decreases.  As the aircraft ascends during flight, the percentage of each  gas in the atmosphere remains the same; however, there are  fewer molecules available at the pressure required for them  to pass between the membranes in the respiratory system.  This decrease in number of oxygen molecules at sufficient  pressure can lead to hypoxic hypoxia.  

# Hypemic Hypoxia  

Hypemic hypoxia occurs when the blood is not able to take  up and transport a sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells  in the body. Hypemic means “not enough blood.” This type  of hypoxia is a result of oxygen deficiency in the blood,  rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen, and can be caused by a  variety of factors. It may be because there is not enough blood  volume (due to severe bleeding), or may result from certain  blood diseases, such as anemia. More often it is because  hemoglobin, the actual blood molecule that transports  oxygen, is chemically unable to bind oxygen molecules. The  most common cause of hypemic hypoxia is carbon monoxide  poisoning. Hypemic hypoxia can also be caused by the loss  of blood from a blood donation. While the volume of blood  is restored quickly following a donation, normal levels of  hemoglobin can require several weeks to return. Although  the effects of the blood loss are slight at ground level, there  are risks when flying during this time.  

# Stagnant Hypoxia  

Stagnant means “not flowing.” Stagnant hypoxia results  when the oxygen-rich blood in the lungs is not moving, for  one reason or another, to the tissues that need it. One form of  stagnant hypoxia is an arm or leg “going to sleep” because  the blood flow has accidentally been shut off. This kind of  hypoxia can also result from shock, the heart failing to pump  blood effectively, or a constricted artery. Cold temperatures  can also reduce circulation and decrease the blood supplied  to extremities.  

# Histotoxic Hypoxia  

The inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen is defined  as histotoxic hypoxia. “Histo” refers to tissues or cells, and  “toxic” means poison. In this case, plenty of oxygen is being  transported to the cells that need it, but they are unable to  make use of it. This impairment of cellular respiration can  be caused by alcohol and other drugs, such as narcotics and  poisons. Research has shown that drinking one ounce of  alcohol can equate to an additional 2,000 feet of physiological  altitude. There are other issues concerning the use of alcohol  in relation to flying in general; those will be discussed later  in this chapter.  

# Symptoms of Hypoxia  

High altitude flying can place a pilot in danger of becoming  hypoxic. Oxygen starvation causes the brain and other vital  organs to become impaired. One noteworthy attribute of  the onset of hypoxia is that the first symptoms are euphoria  and a carefree feeling. With increased oxygen starvation,  the extremities become less responsive and flying becomes  less coordinated. The symptoms of hypoxia vary with the  individual, but common symptoms include:  

•  Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips), •  Headache, •  Decreased reaction time, •  Impaired judgment, •  Euphoria, •  Visual impairment, •  Drowsiness, •  Lightheaded or dizzy sensation,  

As hypoxia worsens, the field of vision begins to narrow,  and instrument interpretation can become difficult. Even  with all these symptoms, the effects of hypoxia can cause  a pilot to have a false sense of security and be deceived  into believing that everything is normal. The treatment for  hypoxia includes descending to lower altitudes and/or using  supplemental oxygen. Supplemental oxygen is required for  certain operations above 12,500 feet mean sea level (MSL).  (See 14 CFR part 91, section 91.211.)  

All pilots are susceptible to the effects of oxygen starvation,  regardless of physical endurance or acclimatization. When  flying at high altitudes, it is paramount that oxygen be used  to avoid the effects of hypoxia. The term “time of useful  consciousness” describes the maximum time the pilot has  to make rational, life-saving decisions and carry them out at  a given altitude without supplemental oxygen. As altitude  increases above 10,000 feet, the symptoms of hypoxia  increase in severity, and the time of useful consciousness  rapidly decreases. Many pilots have established an altitude  lower than the required   $12{,}500~\mathrm{MSL}$   as their personal “do  not exceed without oxygen” limit. All pilots are well advised  to personalize their performance at altitude.  

Since symptoms of hypoxia can be different for each  individual, the ability to recognize hypoxia can be greatly  improved by experiencing and witnessing the effects of it  during an altitude chamber “flight.” The Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) provides this opportunity through  aviation physiology training, which is conducted at the FAA  Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) and at many  military facilities across the United States. To attend an  aviation physiology course at CAMI, call (405) 954-4837  or write:

# Hyperventilation  

Hyperventilation occurs when an individual is experiencing  emotional stress, fright, or pain, and the breathing rate and  depth increase, although the carbon dioxide level in the  blood is already at a reduced level. The result is an excessive  loss of carbon dioxide from the body, which can lead to  unconsciousness due to the respiratory system’s overriding  mechanism to regain control of breathing.  

Pilots encountering an unexpected stressful situation may  subconsciously increase their breathing rate. If flying at  higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a pilot may  have a tendency to breathe more rapidly than normal, which  often leads to hyperventilation.  

Since many of the symptoms of hyperventilation are similar  to those of hypoxia, it is important to correctly diagnose and  treat the proper condition. If using supplemental oxygen,  check the equipment and flow rate to ensure the symptoms  are not hypoxia related.  

Common symptoms of hyperventilation include:  

•  Headache; •  Decreased reaction time; •  Impaired judgment; •  Euphoria; •  Visual impairment; •  Drowsiness; •  Lightheaded or dizzy sensation; •  Tingling in fingers and toes; •  Numbness; •  Pale, clammy appearance; and •  Muscle spasms.  

Hyperventilation may produce a pale, clammy appearance and  muscle spasms compared to the cyanosis and limp muscles  associated with hypoxia. The treatment for hyperventilation  involves restoring the proper carbon dioxide level in the  body. Breathing normally is both the best prevention and  the best cure for hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the  breathing rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking aloud  helps to overcome hyperventilation. Recovery is usually rapid  once the breathing rate is returned to normal.  

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems  

Ascents and descents can sometimes cause ear or sinus  pain and a temporary reduction in the ability to hear. The  physiological explanation for this discomfort is a difference  between the pressure of the air outside the body and that of  the air inside the middle ear and nasal sinuses.  

The middle ear is a small cavity located in the bone of the  skull. It is closed off from the external ear canal by the  eardrum. Normally, pressure differences between the middle  ear and the outside world are equalized by a tube leading  from inside each ear to the back of the throat on each side,  called the eustachian tube. These tubes are usually closed,  but open during chewing, yawning, or swallowing to equalize  pressure. Even a slight difference between external pressure  and middle ear pressure can cause discomfort.  

In a similar way, air pressure in the sinuses equalizes with  the ambient or outside pressure through small openings  that connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. An upper  respiratory infection, such as a cold or sinusitis, or a nasal  allergic condition can produce enough congestion around an  opening to slow equalization. As the difference in pressure  between the sinus and the ambient atmosphere increases,  congestion may plug the opening. This “sinus block” occurs  most frequently during descent. Slow descent rates can reduce  the associated pain. A sinus block can occur in the frontal  sinuses, located above each eyebrow, or in the maxillary  sinuses, located in each upper cheek. It will usually produce  excruciating pain over the sinus area. A maxillary sinus  block can also make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus  may discharge from the nasal passages.  

Sinus block can be avoided by not flying with an upper  respiratory infection or nasal allergic condition. Adequate  protection is usually not provided by decongestant sprays  or drops to reduce congestion around the sinus openings.  Oral decongestants have side effects that can impair pilot  performance. If a sinus block does not clear shortly after  landing, a physician should be consulted.  [Figure 9-1]  

![](images/1e9d4ea86e455ef4fbf4e8f11c320ffd38946d6bea155eabbb451c7775de36d7.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.   The eustachian tube allows air pressure to equalize in  the middle ear.  

During a climb, middle ear air pressure may exceed the  pressure of the air in the external ear canal, causing the  eardrum to bulge outward. Pilots become aware of this  pressure change when they experience alternate sensations  of “fullness” and “clearing.” During descent, the reverse  happens. While the pressure of the air in the external ear  canal increases, the middle ear cavity, which equalized with  the lower pressure at altitude, is at lower pressure than the  external ear canal. This results in the higher outside pressure,  causing the eardrum to bulge inward.  

This condition can be more difficult to relieve due to the  fact that the partial vacuum tends to constrict the walls of  the eustachian tube. To remedy this often painful condition,  which also causes a temporary reduction in hearing  sensitivity, pinch the nostrils shut, close the mouth and lips,  and blow slowly and gently in the mouth and nose. This is  commonly referred to as the Valsalva procedure.  

The Valsalva procedure forces air through the eustachian tube  into the middle ear. It may not be possible to equalize the  pressure in the ears if a pilot has a cold, an ear infection, or  sore throat. A flight in this condition can be extremely painful,  as well as damaging to the eardrums. If a pilot experiences  minor congestion, nose drops or nasal sprays may reduce the  risk of a painful ear blockage.  

# Spatial Disorientation and Illusions  

Balloon pilots rarely experience issues with spatial  disorientation while in flight, as virtually all balloon  operations are conducted under visual flight rules (VFR)  conditions. Knowledge of these conditions, however, is  important in the event of unusual circumstances or situations,  such as inadvertently being caught in fog, or perhaps in areas  of low visibility. The balloon pilot should have an awareness  of these issues, so that appropriate actions may be taken as  necessary.  

Spatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of  orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement  of an aircraft in space. The body uses three integrated systems  working together to ascertain orientation and movement in  space. The eye is by far the largest source of information.  Kinesthesia refers to the sensation of position, movement, and  tension perceived through the nerves, muscles, and tendons.  The vestibular system is a very sensitive motion-sensing  system located in the inner ears. It reports head position,  orientation, and movement in three-dimensional space.  

All this information comes together in the brain and, most  of the time, the three streams of information agree, giving  a clear idea of where and how the body is moving. Flying  can sometimes cause these systems to supply conflicting  information to the brain, which can lead to disorientation.  During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC),  the eyes are the major orientation source and usually prevail  over false sensations from other sensory systems. When  these visual cues are removed, as they are in instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC), false sensations can cause  a pilot to become quickly disoriented.  

The vestibular system in the inner ear allows the pilot  to sense movement and determine orientation in the  surrounding environment. In both left and right inner ears,  three semicircular canals are positioned at approximate right  angles to each other.  [Figure 9-2]  Each canal is filled with  fluid and has a section full of fine hairs. Acceleration of the  inner ear in any direction causes the tiny hairs to deflect,  which in turn stimulate nerve impulses, sending messages to  the brain. The vestibular nerve transmits the impulses from  the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals to the brain to  interpret motion.  

The postural system sends signals from the skin, joints, and  muscles to the brain that are interpreted in relation to the  Earth’s gravitational pull. These signals determine posture.  Inputs from each movement update the body’s position to the  brain on a constant basis. “Seat of the pants” flying is largely  dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual  and vestibular clues, these sensations can be fairly reliable.  However, the body cannot distinguish between acceleration  forces due to gravity and those resulting from maneuvering  the aircraft, which can lead to sensory illusions and false  impressions of an aircraft’s orientation and movement.  

Again, under normal flight conditions, most balloon pilots  and passengers do not experience spatial disorientation (or  vertigo) while flying.  

# Motion Sickness  

Motion sickness, or airsickness, is caused by the brain  receiving conflicting messages about the state of the body. A  pilot may experience motion sickness during initial flights, but  it generally goes away within the first few lessons. Anxiety  and stress, which may be experienced at the beginning of  flight training, can contribute to motion sickness. Symptoms  of motion sickness include general discomfort, nausea,  dizziness, paleness, sweating, and vomiting. Generally, under  normal flight conditions, motion sickness is not an issue for  balloon pilots or passengers.  

# Stress  

Stress is defined as the body’s response to physical and  psychological demands placed upon it. The body’s reaction  to stress includes releasing chemical hormones (such as  adrenaline) into the blood, and increasing metabolism to  provide more energy to the muscles. Blood sugar, heart rate,  respiration, blood pressure, and perspiration all increase. The  term “stressor” is used to describe an element that causes  an individual to experience stress. Examples of stressors  include physical stress (noise or vibration), physiological  stress (fatigue), and psychological stress (difficult work or  personal situations).  

Stress falls into two broad categories: acute (short term) and  chronic (long term). Acute stress involves an immediate  threat that is perceived as danger. This is the type of stress that  triggers a “fight or flight” response in an individual, whether  the threat is real or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can  cope with acute stress and prevent stress overload. However,  ongoing acute stress can develop into chronic stress.  

Chronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that presents  an intolerable burden, exceeds the ability of an individual  to cope, and causes individual performance to fall sharply.  Unrelenting psychological pressures, such as financial  worries, difficult relationships, or work problems can produce  a cumulative level of stress that exceeds a person’s ability  to cope with the situation. When stress reaches these levels,  

![](images/006dfc8ec4a22c1f3f1779c2a388e9104cb49ea40e10de05342b5daf2ed91cda.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.   The semicircular canals lie in three planes, and sense motions of roll, pitch, and yaw.  

performance falls off rapidly. Pilots experiencing this level  of stress are not safe and should not exercise their airman  privileges. Pilots who suspect they are suffering from chronic  stress should consult a physician.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is frequently associated with pilot error. Some of  the effects of fatigue include degradation of attention and  concentration, impaired coordination, and decreased ability  to communicate. These factors can seriously influence the  ability to make effective decisions. Physical fatigue can result  from sleep loss, exercise, or physical work. Factors such as  stress and prolonged performance of cognitive work can  result in mental fatigue.  

Like stress, fatigue also falls into two broad categories: acute  and chronic. Acute fatigue is short term and is a normal  occurrence in everyday living. It is the kind of tiredness  people feel after a period of strenuous effort, excitement, or  lack of sleep. Rest after exertion and 8 hours of sound sleep  ordinarily cures this condition.  

A special type of acute fatigue is skill fatigue. This fatigue  can be readily seen in the balloon pilot who, for example,  has driven most or all of the night in order to attend an  event, or perhaps was up for most of the previous night.  [Figure 9-3]  

![](images/20b88fb7c09d252e8c77ffa2466f6efdccdc92f1366263ab9e0896510cb9db38.jpg)  
Figure 9-3.   This pilot drove all night to make an event, but still will  not be able to fly.  

This type of fatigue has two main effects on performance:  

Timing disruption—appearing to perform a task as  usual, but the timing of each component is slightly off.  This makes the pattern of the operation less smooth,  because the pilot performs each component as though  it were separate, instead of as a part of an integrated  activity. Disruption of the perceptual field—concentrating  attention upon movements or objects in the center of  vision and neglecting those in the periphery. This may  be accompanied by loss of accuracy and smoothness  in control movements.  

Acute fatigue has many causes, but the following are among  the most important to the pilot:  

•   Mild hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), •   Physical stress, •   Psychological stress, and •   Depletion of physical energy resulting from  psychological stress.  

Sustained psychological stress accelerates the glandular  secretions that prepare the body for quick reactions during  an emergency. These secretions make the circulatory and  respiratory systems work harder, and the liver releases energy  to provide the extra fuel needed for brain and muscle work.  When this reserve energy supply is depleted, the body lapses  into generalized and severe fatigue.  

Acute fatigue can be prevented by proper diet and adequate  rest and sleep. A well-balanced diet prevents the body from  consuming its own tissues as an energy source. Adequate  rest maintains the body’s store of vital energy.  

Chronic fatigue, extending over a long period of time, usually  has psychological roots, although an underlying disease is  sometimes responsible. Continuous high stress levels, for  example, can produce chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue is  not relieved by proper diet and adequate rest and sleep, and  usually requires treatment by a physician. An individual may  experience this condition in the form of weakness, tiredness,  palpitations of the heart, breathlessness, headaches, or  irritability. Sometimes chronic fatigue even creates stomach  or intestinal problems and generalized aches and pains  throughout the body. When the condition becomes serious  enough, it can lead to emotional illness.  

If suffering from acute fatigue, stay on the ground. If fatigue  occurs in the basket, no amount of training or experience  can overcome the detrimental effects. Getting adequate  rest and nutrition is the only way to prevent fatigue from  occurring. Avoid flying without a full night’s rest, after  working excessive hours, or after an especially exhausting  or stressful day. Pilots who suspect they are suffering from  chronic fatigue should consult a physician.  

# Dehydration and Heatstroke  

Dehydration is the term given to a critical loss of water from  the body. The first noticeable effect of dehydration is fatigue,  which in turn makes top physical and mental performance  difficult, if not impossible. As a pilot, flying for long periods  in hot summer temperatures or at high altitudes increases the  susceptibility of dehydration since the dry air at altitude tends  to increase the rate of water loss from the body. If this fluid  is not replaced, fatigue progresses to dizziness, weakness,  nausea, tingling of hands and feet, abdominal cramps, and  extreme thirst.  [Figure 9-4]

Figure 9-4.   Hydration is important both before and after participating  in outdoor activities. While for obvious reasons during hot weather,  an individual can dehydrate during cold weather, too.  

Heatstroke is a condition caused by inability of the body  to control its temperature. Onset of this condition may be  recognized by the symptoms of dehydration, but it has also  been recognized only by complete collapse.  

To prevent these symptoms, it is recommended that a pilot  carry an ample supply of water to drink at frequent intervals  on any long flight, whether thirsty or not.  

# Alcohol  

Alcohol impairs the efficiency of the human body. Studies  have proven that drinking and performance deterioration  are closely linked. Pilots must make hundreds of decisions,  some of them time critical, during the course of a flight.  The safe outcome of any flight depends on the ability to  make the correct decisions and take the appropriate actions  during routine occurrences, as well as abnormal situations.  The influence of alcohol drastically reduces the chances of  completing a flight without incident. Even in small amounts,  alcohol can impair judgment, decrease sense of responsibility,  affect coordination, constrict visual field, diminish memory,  reduce reasoning power, and lower attention span. As little  as one ounce of alcohol can decrease the speed and strength  of muscular reflexes, lessen the efficiency of eye movements  while reading, and increase the frequency at which errors are  committed. Impairments in vision and hearing can occur after  consuming only one alcoholic drink.  

The alcohol consumed in beer and mixed drinks is ethyl  alcohol, a powerful central nervous system depressant. It  acts on the body much like a general anesthetic. The “dose”  is generally much lower and more slowly consumed in the  case of alcohol, but the basic effects on the body are similar.  Alcohol is easily and quickly absorbed by the digestive tract.  The bloodstream absorbs about 80 to 90 percent of the alcohol  in a drink within 30 minutes on an empty stomach. The body  requires about 3 hours to rid itself of all the alcohol contained  in one mixed drink or one beer.  

When experiencing a hangover, a pilot is still under the  influence of alcohol. Although a pilot may think that he  or she is functioning normally, motor and mental response  impairment is still present. Considerable amounts of alcohol  can remain in the body for over 16 hours, so pilots should be  cautious about flying too soon after drinking.  

Altitude multiplies the effects of alcohol on the brain. When  combined with altitude, the alcohol from two drinks may have  the same effect as three or four drinks. Alcohol interferes  with the brain’s ability to utilize oxygen, producing a form  of histotoxic hypoxia. The effects are rapid because alcohol  passes quickly into the bloodstream. In addition, the brain is a  highly vascular organ that is immediately sensitive to changes  in the blood’s composition. For a pilot, the lower oxygen  availability at altitude and the lower capability of the brain  to use available oxygen add up to a deadly combination.  

Intoxication is determined by the amount of alcohol in the  bloodstream. This is usually measured as a percentage by  weight in the blood. 14 CFR part 91, section 91.17 requires  that blood alcohol level be less than 0.04 percent and that 8  hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting an aircraft.  A pilot with a blood alcohol level of 0.04 percent or greater  after 8 hours cannot fly until the blood alcohol falls below that  amount. Even though blood alcohol may be well below 0.04  percent, a pilot cannot fly sooner than 8 hours after drinking  alcohol. Although the regulations are quite specific, it is a  good idea to be more conservative than the regulations.  

# Drugs  

Pilot performance can be seriously degraded by both  prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as  by the medical conditions for which they are taken. Many  medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives, strong pain  relievers, and cough suppressants have primary effects that  may impair judgment, memory, alertness, coordination,  vision, and the ability to make calculations. Others, such  as antihistamines, blood pressure drugs, muscle relaxants,  and agents to control diarrhea and motion sickness have  side effects that may impair the same critical functions.  Any medication that depresses the nervous system, such as  sedatives, tranquilizers, or antihistamines can make a pilot  more susceptible to hypoxia.  

Painkillers can be grouped into two broad categories:  analgesics and anesthetics. Analgesics are drugs that reduce  pain, while anesthetics are drugs that deaden pain or cause  loss of consciousness.  

Over-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid  (aspirin), acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), and ibuprofen (e.g.,  Advil) have few side effects when taken in the correct dosage.  Although some people are allergic to certain analgesics or  may suffer from stomach irritation, flying usually is not  restricted when taking these drugs. However, flying is almost  always precluded while using prescription analgesics, such  as drugs containing propoxyphene (e.g., Darvon), oxycodone  (e.g., Percodan), meperidine (e.g., Demerol), and codeine  since these drugs may cause side effects such as mental  confusion, dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.  Anesthetic drugs are commonly used for dental and surgical  procedures. Most local anesthetics used for minor dental and  outpatient procedures wear off within a relatively short period  of time. The anesthetic itself may not limit flying so much  as the actual procedure and subsequent pain.  

Stimulants are drugs that excite the central nervous  system and produce an increase in alertness and activity.  Amphetamines, caffeine, and nicotine are all forms of  stimulants. Common uses of these drugs include appetite  suppression, fatigue reduction, and mood elevation. Some  of these drugs may cause a stimulant reaction, even though  this reaction is not their primary function. In some cases,  stimulants can produce anxiety and mood swings, both of  which are dangerous when flying.  

several types of drugs that can cause a depressing effect on the  body, including tranquilizers, motion sickness medication,  and some types of stomach medication, decongestants, and  antihistamines. The most common depressant is alcohol.  

Some drugs, which can be classified as neither stimulants  nor depressants, have adverse effects on flying. For example,  some forms of antibiotics can produce dangerous side effects,  such as balance disorders, hearing loss, nausea, and vomiting.  While many antibiotics are safe for use while flying, the  infection requiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying. In  addition, unless specifically prescribed by a physician, do not  take more than one drug at a time, and never mix drugs with  alcohol because the effects are often unpredictable.  

The dangers of illegal drugs also are well documented.  Certain illegal drugs can have hallucinatory effects that occur  days or weeks after the drug is taken. Obviously, these drugs  have no place in the aviation community.  

14 CFR part 65 prohibits pilots from performing crewmember  duties while using any medication that affects the body in  any way contrary to safety. The safest rule is not to fly as a  crewmember while taking any medication, unless approved to  do so by the FAA. If there is any doubt regarding the effects  of any medication, consult an AME before flying.  

# Scuba Diving  

Scuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure, which  allows more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues and fluids.  The reduction of atmospheric pressure that accompanies  flying can produce physical problems for scuba divers.  Reducing the pressure too quickly allows small bubbles of  nitrogen to form inside the body as the gas comes out of  solution. These bubbles can cause a painful and potentially  incapacitating condition called “the bends.” (An example  is dissolved gas forming bubbles as pressure decreases by  slowly opening a transparent bottle of carbonated beverage.)  Scuba training emphasizes how to prevent the bends when  rising to the surface, but increased nitrogen concentrations  can remain in tissue fluids for several hours after a diver  leaves the water. The bends can be experienced from as low as  8,000 feet MSL, with increasing severity as altitude increases.  As noted in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM),  the minimum recommended time between scuba diving on  non decompression stop dives and flying is 12 hours, while  the minimum time recommended between decompression  stop diving and flying is 24 hours.  [Figure 9-5]  

Depressants are drugs that reduce the body’s functioning in  many areas. These drugs lower blood pressure, reduce mental  processing, and slow motor and reaction responses. There are

Figure 9-5.   The reduction of atmospheric pressure that accompanies  flying can produce physical problems for scuba   divers.  

# Vision in Flight  

Of all the senses, vision is the most important for safe flight.  Most of the things perceived while flying are visual or heavily  supplemented by vision. As remarkable and vital as it is,  vision is subject to some limitations, such as illusions and  blind spots. The more a pilot understands about the eyes and  how they function, the easier it is to use vision effectively  and compensate for potential problems.  

for registering images. Light enters through the cornea at the  front of the eyeball, travels through the lens, and falls on the  retina. The retina contains light sensitive cells that convert  light energy into electrical impulses that travel through nerves  to the brain. The brain interprets the electrical signals to form  images. There are two kinds of light-sensitive cells in the  eyes: rods and cones.  [Figure 9-6]  

The cones are responsible for all color vision, from  appreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle shades  in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout the retina, but  are concentrated toward the center of the field of vision at the  back of the retina. There is a small pit called the fovea where  almost all the light sensing cells are cones. This is the area  where most “looking” occurs (the center of the visual field  where detail, color sensitivity, and resolution are highest).  

While the cones and their associated nerves are well suited  to detecting fine detail and color in high light levels, the rods  are better able to detect movement and provide vision in  dim light. The rods are unable to discern color but are very  sensitive at low light levels. However, a large amount of light  overwhelms the rods, and they take a long time to “reset”  and adapt to the dark again. There are so many cones in the  fovea that the very center of the visual field has virtually no  rods at all. Therefore, the middle of the visual field is not  very sensitive in low light. Farther from the fovea, the rods  are more numerous and provide the major portion of night  

![](images/22a6bbecd66541ee8fee1105dd57e1059d873f61c72923e72cff64b35a08d4ee.jpg)  
an aperture, a lens, a mechanism for focusing, and a surface  

![](images/b29aef265ea9ce17d00dc5be917b716a894470c0ad00adbdc43c2680e2b3a492.jpg)  
Figure 9-7.   The eye’s blind spot.  

The area where the optic nerve enters the eyeball has no rods  or cones, leaving a blind spot in the field of vision. Normally,  each eye compensates for the other’s blind spot.  Figure 9-7 provides a dramatic example of the eye’s blind spot. Cover  the right eye and hold this page at arm’s length. Focus the left  eye on the X in the right side of the windshield, and notice  what happens to the balloon while slowly bringing the page  closer to the eye.  

# Empty-Field Myopia  

Another problem associated with flying at night or in reduced  visibility is empty-field myopia, or induced nearsightedness.  With nothing on which to focus, the eyes automatically focus  on a point just slightly ahead of the aircraft. Searching out  and focusing on distant light sources, no matter how dim,  helps prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.  

# Night Vision  

It is estimated that once fully adapted to darkness, the rods are  10,000 times more sensitive to light than the cones, making  them the primary receptors for night vision. Since the cones  are concentrated near the fovea, the rods are also responsible  for much of the peripheral vision. The concentration of cones  in the fovea can make a night blind spot in the center of the  field of vision. T o see an object clearly at night, the pilot must  expose the rods to the image. This can be done by looking  $5^{\circ}$  to  $10^{\circ}$   off center of the object to be seen. This can be tried in  a dim light in a darkened room. When looking directly at the  light, it dims or disappears altogether.  [Figure 9-8]  

When looking slightly off center, it becomes clearer and  brighter. Refer to  Figure 9-8.  When looking directly at an  object, the image is focused mainly on the fovea, where detail  is best seen. At night, the ability to see an object in the center  of the visual field is reduced as the cones lose much of their  sensitivity and the rods become more sensitive. Looking off  center can help compensate for this night blind spot. Along  with the loss of acuity (sharpness) and color at night, depth  perception and judgment of size may be lost.  

Balloon pilots, while not normally conducting flight  operations at night, can experience similar issues when flying  in low light conditions, particularly if there is haze or reduced  visibility. In those instances where the balloon is operated at  night, such as during a night “glow” or tether, night vision  can be immediately destroyed by the light from the burner.  It may take several minutes for the pilot to recover his or  her vision, time in which complete awareness of his or her  

![](images/b07c3891b027244790da675a5102218343618506c1261ff2aad9d5f1e390ff05.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.  Night blind spot.  

surroundings is lost. If those surroundings include people,  a potentially dangerous situation can ensue. Closing one  eye during a burn and not looking at the burner flame will  minimize this momentary blindness.  

Diet and general physical health have an impact on how well  a pilot can see in the dark. Deficiencies in vitamins A and C  have been shown to reduce night visual acuity. Other factors,  such as carbon monoxide poisoning, smoking, alcohol, certain  drugs, and a lack of oxygen also can greatly decrease night  vision.  

# Chapter Summary  

Balloon pilots and glider pilots are unique in that they “self- certify” they are physically fit to conduct flight duties. This  is an individual responsibility and must not be abused. The  ability to “self-certify” becomes particularly problematic  after the balloon pilot has had a major medical issue arise,  such as a heart attack, angina, major surgery, and other items  in this category. While they may be perfectly capable of  piloting a balloon after triple bypass surgery, for example,  it may not be the recommended course of action.  

The best recommendation is to be aware of the provisions  of 14 CFR part 61. If a medical issue may be medically  disqualifying for other pilots, the balloon pilot would be well  advised to consult with an AME, and obtain recommendations  on how best to proceed.  

# Chapter 10 The Instructional  Process  

As previously discussed in Chapter 1, commercially rated  balloon pilots have the additional responsibility and privilege  of providing instruction to aspiring student pilots, without the  benefit of having a certified flight instructor (CFI) rating. This  is unique to balloon pilots, as all other aircraft pilots require  instruction by a CFI in order to achieve their certificate.  

Flight training, whether in an airplane, helicopter, or a  balloon, should be conducted in a complete and thorough  manner in order to prepare the student pilot to safely conduct  flight operations throughout the entire spectrum of scenarios.  An ill-prepared instructor can produce only an ill-prepared  student. A well-prepared instructor produces a well-prepared  student, and he or she reaps the additional benefit of showing  the student how instruction should be conducted. That pilot,  in later stages, reflects on his or her own training and probably  conducts future training in the same manner.  

The flight instructor is the central figure in aviation training  and is responsible for all phases of required training. The  instructor must be fully qualified as an aviation professional;  however, the instructor’s ability must go far beyond this if  the requirements of professionalism are to be met. Although  the word “professionalism” is widely used, it is rarely  defined. In fact, no single definition can encompass all of the  qualifications and considerations that must be present before  true professionalism can exist.  

When discussing professionalism, most conversations omit  any reference to the accountability of the instructor. An  individual who takes on the responsibility of providing  flight instruction must realize that they have a significant  influence on the habits and actions of the student as a pilot.  All of the student’s impressions and perceptions towards the  flight experience, balloon operations, and,  most importantly,  safety  is drawn from the instructor’s methods. It becomes  imperative that the instructor understand that he or she,  by default, actively and passively contributes to the future  actions of the student and should make every effort to provide  the most thorough training experience possible. It can be said  that many students become “clones” of their instructor.  

Though not all inclusive, the following list gives some major  considerations and qualifications that should be included in  the definition of professionalism.  

•  Professionalism exists only when a service is  performed for someone or for the common good. •  Professionalism is achieved only after extended  training and preparation. •  True performance as a professional is based on study  and research. •  Professionalism requires the ability to make good  judgment decisions. Professionals cannot limit  their actions and decisions to standard patterns and  practices. •  Professionalism demands a code of ethics. Professionals  must be true to themselves and to those they serve.  Anything less than a sincere performance is quickly  detected by the student and immediately destroys  instructor effectiveness. •  Professionalism requires that the individual instructor  be able to conduct a self-assessment. A true professional  must be able to critique his or her own performance  with objectivity.  

Flight instructors should carefully consider this list. Failing to  meet these qualities may result in poor performance by both  instructor and student. Preparation and performance as an  instructor with these qualities in mind commands recognition  as a professional in aviation instruction. Professionalism  includes an instructor’s public image.  

A more complete discussion of the information contained  in this chapter may be found in FAA-H-8083-9, Aviation  Instructor’s Handbook. There have been some minor changes  in this chapter to address the specific aspects of balloon  flight training. For expanded discussions of the areas of  operation covered in the Commercial Pilot Practical Test  Standards (PTS), (FAA-S-8081-18), the Aviation Instructor’s  Handbook is required reading. Commercial pilots who wish  to excel at the instruction process may consider taking the  Fundamentals of Instruction knowledge test administered  through the FAA ’s knowledge testing program. While not a  mandatory requirement, it is believed that the study necessary  to successfully complete this exam assists the pilot/instructor  in acquiring the knowledge necessary to plan and perform  proper aviation training.  

For the remainder of this chapter, it should be understood that  the term “flight instructor” is meant to define those individuals  who hold a commercial pilot certificate with a free balloon  category rating. This chapter also makes the presupposition  that virtually all balloon flight training is performed “one on  one,” and not as part of a group environment.  

# Flight Instructor Characteristics and  Responsibilities  

Students look to flight instructors as authorities in their  respective areas. It is important that flight instructors not  only know how to teach, but they also need to project a  knowledgeable and professional image. In addition, flight  instructors are on the front lines of efforts to improve the  safety record of the industry. This section addresses the  scope of responsibilities for flight instructors and enumerates  methods they can use to enhance their professional image  and conduct.  

# Instructor Responsibilities  

The job of a flight instructor, or any instructor, is to teach.  The learning process can be made easier by helping students  learn, providing adequate instruction, demanding adequate  standards of performance, and emphasizing the positive.  [Figure 10-1]  

![](images/2f794743ffc81c7cb593903f025b53b90941d51dc0e153ef6cf7b0a7a15627b4.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.   The four main responsibilities for flight instructors.  

# Helping Students Learn  

Learning should be an enjoyable experience. By making  each lesson a pleasurable experience for the student, the  instructor can maintain a high level of student motivation.  This does not mean the instructor must make things easy for  the student or sacrifice standards of performance to please  the student. The student experiences satisfaction from doing  a good job or from successfully meeting the challenge of a  difficult task.  

Learning should be interesting. Knowing the objectives,  in clear and concise terms, of each period of instruction  gives meaning and interest to the student, as well as the  instructor. Not knowing the objective of the lesson often  leads to confusion, disinterest, and uneasiness on the part  of the student.  

Learning to fly should be a habit-building period during  which the student devotes his or her attention, memory, and  judgment to the development of correct habits. Any objective  other than to learn the right way is likely to make students  impatient. The instructor should keep the students focused  on good habits both by example and by a logical presentation  of learning tasks.  

# Providing Adequate Instruction  

The flight instructor should attempt to carefully and correctly  analyze the student’s personality, thinking, and ability. No  two students are alike, and no one method of instruction can  be equally effective for each student. The instructor must talk  with a student at some length to learn about the student’s  background interests, temperament, and way of thinking.  The instructor’s methods also may change as the student  advances through successive stages of training.  

An instructor who has not correctly analyzed a student may  soon find that the instruction is not producing the desired  results. For example, this could mean that the instructor does  not realize that a student is actually a quick thinker, but is  hesitant to act. Such a student may fail to act at the proper time  due to lack of self-confidence, even though the situation is  correctly understood. In this case, instruction would obviously  be directed toward developing student self-confidence, rather  than drill on flight fundamentals. In another case, too much  criticism may completely subdue a timid person, whereas  brisk instruction may force a more diligent application to the  learning task. A student may require instructional methods  that combine tact, keen perception, and delicate handling. If  such a student receives too much help and encouragement,  a feeling of incompetence may develop.  

# Standards of Performance  

Flight instructors must continuously evaluate their own  effectiveness and the standard of learning and performance  achieved by their students. The desire to maintain pleasant  personal relationships with the students must not cause  the acceptance of a slow rate of learning or substandard  flight performance. It is a fallacy to believe that accepting  lower standards to please a student produces a genuine  improvement in the student-instructor relationship. An  earnest student does not resent reasonable standards that are  fairly and consistently applied.  

# Emphasizing the Positive  

Flight instructors have a tremendous influence on their  students’ perception of aviation. The way instructors conduct  themselves, the attitudes they display, and the manner in  which they develop their instruction all contribute to the  formation of either positive or negative impressions by their  student. The success of a flight instructor depends, in large  measure, on the ability to present instruction so that a student  develops a positive image of aviation.  

Most new instructors tend to adopt those teaching methods  used by their own instructors. These methods may or may  not have been good. The fact that one has learned under one  system of instruction does not mean that this is necessarily the  best way it can be done, regardless of the respect one retains  for the ability of their original instructor. Some students  learn in spite of their instruction, rather than because of it.  Emphasize the positive because positive instruction results  in positive learning.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibilities  

All flight instructors shoulder an enormous responsibility  because their students ultimately fly an aircraft. Flight  instructors have some additional responsibilities including  the responsibility of evaluating student pilots and making a  determination of when they are ready to solo. Other flight  instructor responsibilities are based on Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61 and advisory circulars  (ACs).  [Figure 10-2]  

# Evaluation of Student Piloting Ability  

Evaluation is one of the most important elements of  instruction. In flight instruction, the instructor initially  determines that the student understands the procedure or  maneuver. Then the instructor demonstrates the maneuver,  allows the student to practice the maneuver under direction,  and finally evaluates student accomplishment by observing  their performance.  

![](images/a6de3ba1051860488717f65f81f7280008f42986be9b9e315ef9e9f4f190ad40.jpg)  
Figure 10-2.   The flight instructor has many additional  responsibilities.  

Evaluation of demonstrated ability during flight instruction  must be based upon established standards of performance,  suitably modified to apply to the student’s experience and  stage of development as a pilot. The evaluation must consider  the student’s mastery of all the elements involved in the  maneuver, rather than merely the overall performance.  

Correction of student errors should not include the practice  of taking the controls away from students immediately when  a mistake is made. Safety permitting, it is frequently better  to let students progress part of the way into the mistake  and find their own way out. It is difficult for students to  learn to do a maneuver properly if they seldom have the  opportunity to correct an error. On the other hand, students  may perform a procedure or maneuver correctly and not fully  understand the principles and objectives involved. When  the instructor suspects this, students should be required to  vary the performance of the maneuver slightly, combine  it with other operations, or apply the same elements to  the performance of other maneuvers. Students who do not  understand the principles involved probably are not able to  do this successfully.  

# Student Pilot Supervision  

Flight instructors have the responsibility to provide guidance  and restraint with respect to the solo operations of their  students. This is by far the most important flight instructor  responsibility because the instructor is the only person in a  position to make the determination that a student is ready for  solo operations. Before endorsing a student for solo flight, the  instructor should require the student to demonstrate consistent  ability to perform all of the fundamental maneuvers.  

# Practical Test Recommendations  

Provisions are made on the airman certificate or rating  application form for the written recommendation of the flight  instructor who has prepared the applicant for the practical  test involved. Signing this recommendation imposes a serious  responsibility on the flight instructor. A flight instructor  who makes a practical test recommendation for an applicant  seeking a certificate or rating should require the applicant  to thoroughly demonstrate the knowledge and skill level  required for that certificate or rating. This demonstration  should in no instance be less than the complete procedure  prescribed in the applicable PTS.  

A practical test recommendation based on anything less risks  the presentation of an applicant who may be unprepared for  some part of the actual practical test. In such an event, the  flight instructor is logically held accountable for a deficient  instructional performance. This risk is especially great in  signing recommendations for applicants who have not been  trained by the instructor involved. For balloons, 14 CFR part  61 requires a minimum of two training flights of one hour  each with an authorized instructor within 60 days preceding  the date of the test for a private or commercial certificate.  The instructor signing the endorsement is required to have  conducted the training in the applicable areas of operation  stated in the regulations and the PTS, and certifies that the  person is prepared for the required practical test. In most  cases, the conscientious instructor has little doubt concerning  the applicant’s readiness for the practical test.  

FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners rely on flight  instructor recommendations as evidence of qualification  for certification, and proof that a review has been given of  the subject areas found to be deficient on the appropriate  knowledge test. Recommendations also provide assurance  that the applicant has had a thorough briefing on the  practical test standards and the associated knowledge areas,  maneuvers, and procedures. If the flight instructor has trained  and prepared the applicant competently, the applicant should  have no problem passing the practical test.  

The recommended format for log book endorsements may  be found in the current version of AC 61-65; an extract  of those relevant to balloon instruction may be found in  Appendix E.  

# Self-Improvement  

Professional flight instructors must never become complacent  or satisfied with their own qualifications and abilities.  They should be constantly alert for ways to improve their  qualifications, effectiveness, and the services they provide  to students. Flight instructors are considered authorities on  aeronautical matters and are the experts to whom many pilots  refer questions concerning regulations, requirements, and  new operating techniques.  

# Sincerity  

The professional instructor should be straightforward and  honest. Attempting to hide some inadequacy behind a  smokescreen of unrelated instruction makes it impossible  for the instructor to command the respect and full attention  of a student. Teaching an aviation student is based upon  acceptance of the instructor as a competent, qualified teacher  and an expert pilot. Any facade of instructor pretentiousness,  whether it is real or mistakenly assumed by the student,  immediately causes the student to lose confidence in the  instructor and learning is adversely affected.  

# Acceptance of the Student  

With regard to students, the instructor must accept them as  they are, including all their faults and problems. The student  is a person who wants to learn, and the instructor is a person  who is available to help in the learning process. Beginning  with this understanding, the professional relationship of  the instructor with the student should be based on a mutual  acknowledgement that the student and the instructor are  important to each other, and that both are working toward  the same objective.  

# Personal Appearance and Habits  

Personal appearance has an important effect on the  professional image of the instructor. Today’s aviation  customers expect their instructors to be neat, clean, and  appropriately dressed. Since the instructor is engaged in a  learning situation, the attire worn should be appropriate to a  professional status.  [Figure 10-3]  

Personal habits have a significant effect on the professional  image. The exercise of common courtesy is perhaps the most  important of these.  

# Demeanor  

The attitude and behavior of the instructor can contribute  much to a professional image. The professional image  requires development of a calm, thoughtful, and disciplined,  but not somber, demeanor.  

The instructor should also present an attitude of enthusiasm,  with respect to the training conducted, whether ground  or flight. The enthusiasm expressed by the instructor is  normally reflected in the student’s response to the training,  and makes it a much more enjoyable experience for all parties  concerned.  

# Safety Practices and Accident Prevention  

The safety practices emphasized by instructors have a long  lasting effect on students. Generally, students consider their  instructor to be a model of perfection whose habits they  

![](images/a18810956b9cf9be8940d54c5144f58642666c20903ea992a5855042ea6abf00.jpg)  
Figure 10-3.   The flight instructor should always present a professional appearance.  

attempt to imitate, whether consciously or unconsciously. The  instructor’s advocacy and description of safety practices mean  little to a student if the instructor does not demonstrate them  consistently. For this reason, instructors must meticulously  observe the safety practices being taught to students. A good  example is the use of a checklist before takeoff. If a student  pilot sees the flight instructor layout, inflate, and take off  in a balloon without referring to a checklist, no amount of  instruction in the use of a checklist convinces that student to  faithfully use one when solo flight operations begin.  

To maintain a professional image, a flight instructor must  carefully observe all regulations and recognized safety  practices during flight operations. An instructor who is  observed to fly with apparent disregard for loading limitations  or weather minimums creates an image of irresponsibility that  many hours of scrupulous flight instruction can never correct.  Habitual observance of regulations, safety precautions, and  the precepts of courtesy enhances the instructor’s image of  professionalism. Moreover, such habits make the instructor  more effective by encouraging students to develop similar  habits.  

# Proper Language  

In aviation instruction, as in other professional activities, the  use of profanity and obscene language leads to distrust or,  at best, to a lack of complete confidence in the instructor.  To many people, such language is actually objectionable to  the point of being painful. The professional instructor must  speak normally, without inhibitions, and develop the ability  to speak positively and descriptively without excesses of  language.  

Also consider that the beginning aviation student is being  introduced to new concepts and experiences and encountering  new terms and phrases that are often confusing. At the  beginning of the student’s training, and before each lesson  during early instruction, the instructor should carefully define  the terms and phrases to be used during the lesson. The  instructor should then be careful to limit instruction to those  terms and phrases, unless the exact meaning and intent of  any new expression are explained immediately. In all cases,  terminology should be explained to the student before it is  used during instruction.  

# The Learning Process  

To learn is to acquire knowledge or skill. Learning also may  involve a change in attitude or behavior. Pilots need to acquire  the higher levels of knowledge and skill, including the ability  to exercise judgment and solve problems. The challenge for  the flight instructor is to understand how people learn, and  more importantly, to be able to apply that knowledge to the  learning environment.  [Figure 10-4]

Figure 10-4.   Effective learning shares several common  characteristics.  

# Deﬁnition of Learning  

The ability to learn is one of the most outstanding human  characteristics. Learning occurs continuously throughout  a person’s lifetime. To define learning, it is necessary to  analyze what happens to the individual. Thus, learning can  be defined as a change in behavior as a result of experience.  This can be physical and overt, or it may involve complex  intellectual or attitudinal changes which affect behavior  in more subtle ways. In spite of numerous theories and  contrasting views, psychologists generally agree on many  common characteristics of learning.  

# Characteristics of Learning  

Flight instructors need a good understanding of the general  characteristics of learning in order to apply them in a  learning situation. If learning is a change in behavior as a  result of experience, then instruction must include a careful  and systematic creation of those experiences that promote  learning. This process can be quite complex because, among  other things, an individual’s background strongly influences  the way that person learns. To be effective, the learning  situation should contain the following four points:  

1.  Learning is purposeful. Most people have definite  ideas about what they want to do and achieve. Their  goals are sometimes short term, involving a matter of  days or weeks, while others may have goals carefully  planned for a career or a lifetime. Each student, then,  has specific intentions and goals. Learning, then,  becomes a means to those goals. 2.  Learning is a result of experience. A student can learn  only from personal experience; therefore learning and  knowledge cannot exist apart from a person. Even  when observing or performing the same procedures,  two people can react differently; they learn different  

things from it, according to the manner in which the  event affects their individual needs.  

3.  Learning is multifaceted. The learning process  includes verbal elements, emotional elements, and  problem-solving elements all taking place at once.  4.  Learning is an active process. The individual who  wishes to be proficient at a particular task or skill  should understand that they never stop learning.  

# Principles of Learning  

Over the years, educational psychologists have identified  several principles which seem generally applicable to the  learning process. They provide additional insight into what  makes people learn most effectively.  

•  Readiness—individuals learn best when they are  ready to learn. However, they do not learn well if  they see no reason for learning. Getting students ready  to learn is usually the instructor’s responsibility. If  students have a strong purpose, a clear objective, and  a definite reason for learning something, they make  more progress than if they lack motivation.  •  Exercise—the principle of exercise states that those  things most often repeated are best remembered. It is  the basis of drill and practice. The human memory  is fallible. The mind can rarely retain, evaluate,  and apply new concepts or practices after a single  exposure. Students learn by applying what they have  been told and shown. Every time practice occurs,  learning continues. The instructor must provide  opportunities for students to practice and, at the same  time, make sure that this process is directed toward a  goal. •  Effect—based on the emotional reaction of the  student. It states that learning is strengthened when  accompanied by a pleasant or satisfying feeling, and  that learning is weakened when associated with an  unpleasant feeling. Experiences that produce feelings  of defeat, frustration, anger, confusion, or futility  are unpleasant for the student. If, for example, an  instructor attempts to teach precision maneuvering  during the first flight, the student is likely to feel  inferior and be frustrated. •  Primacy—the state of being first, often creates a  strong, almost unshakable, impression. For the  instructor, this means that what is taught must be right  the first time. For the student, it means that learning  must be right. “Unteaching” is often more difficult  than teaching. Every student should be started right.  The first experience should be positive, functional,  and lay the foundation for all that is to follow.  

•  Intensity—a vivid, dramatic, or exciting learning  experience teaches more than a routine or boring  experience. A student is likely to gain greater  understanding of steep approaches or short-field, high  wind landings by performing them rather than merely  reading about them. The principle of intensity implies  that a student learns more from the real thing than from  a substitute.  

•  Recency—things most recently learned are best  remembered. Conversely, the further a student is  removed in time from a new factor in understanding,  the more difficult it is to remember. Instructors  recognize the principle of recency when they carefully  plan a summary for a ground school lesson, a flight  period, or a postflight critique.  

# How People Learn  

Initially, all learning comes from perceptions which are  directed to the brain by one or more of the five senses:  sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Psychologists  have also found that learning occurs most rapidly when  information is received through more than one of the senses.  [Figure 10-5]  

![](images/3dc1c72943d97d749e517711db4c942658daf0bf096c0aeaa3ae7f403251c0d4.jpg)  
Figure 10-5.   Most learning occurs through sight, but the  combination of sight and hearing accounts for about 99 percent  of all perception.  

# Perceptions  

Perceiving involves more than the reception of stimuli from  the five senses. Perceptions result when a person gives  meaning to sensations. People base their actions on the way  they believe things to be.  

Real meaning comes only from within a person, even though  the perceptions which evoke these meanings result from  external stimuli. The meanings which are derived from  perceptions are influenced not only by the individual’s  experience, but also by many other factors. Knowledge of the  factors which affect the perceptual process is very important  to the flight instructor because perceptions are the basis of  all learning.  

# Factions Which Affect Perception  

There are several factors that affect an individual’s ability  to perceive. Some are internal to each person and some are  external.  

•  Physical organism—provides individuals with the  perceptual sensors for perceiving the world around  them.  •  Basic need—a person’s basic need is to maintain and  enhance the organized self. A person’s most pressing  need is to preserve and perpetuate the self. T o that end,  an instructor must remember that anything asked of  the student that may be interpreted by the student as  endangering the self is resisted or denied. •  Goals and values—perceptions depend on one’s  goals and values. The precise kinds of commitments  and philosophical outlooks which the student holds  are important for the instructor to know, since this  knowledge assists in predicting how the student  interprets experiences and instructions. •  Self-concept—a powerful determinant in learning. If  a student’s experiences tend to support a favorable  self-image, the student tends to remain receptive  to subsequent experiences. A negative self-concept  inhibits the perceptual processes which tend to keep  the student from perceiving, effectively blocking the  learning process. •  Time and opportunity—it takes time and opportunity  to perceive. Learning some things depends on other  perceptions which have preceded these learnings, and  on the availability of time to sense and relate these  new things to the earlier perceptions. Thus, sequence  and time are necessary.  •  Element of threat—does not promote effective  learning. When confronted with a perceived threat,  students tent to limit their attention to the threatening  object or condition.  

# Insight  

Insight involves the grouping of perceptions into meaningful  groups of understanding. Creating insight is one of the  instructor’s major responsibilities. To ensure that this does  occur, it is essential to keep each student constantly receptive  to new experiences and to help the student realize the way  each piece relates to all other pieces of the total pattern of  the task to be learned.  

As perceptions increase in number and are assembled by the  student into larger blocks of learning, they develop insight.  As a result, learning becomes more meaningful and more  permanent. Forgetting is less of a problem when there are  more anchor points for tying insights together. It is a major  responsibility of the instructor to organize demonstrations and  explanations, and to direct practice, so that the student has  better opportunities to understand the interrelationship of the  many kinds of experiences that have been perceived. Pointing  out the relationships as they occur, providing a secure and  nonthreatening environment in which to learn, and helping  the student acquire and maintain a favorable self-concept are  key steps in fostering the development of insight.  

# Motivation  

Motivation is probably the dominant force governing the  student’s progress and ability to learn. Motivation may  be positive or negative, tangible or intangible, subtle and  difficult to identify, or it may be obvious.  

Positive motivation is provided by the promise or achievement  of rewards. These rewards may be personal or social; they  may involve financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept,  or public recognition. Motivation which can be used to  advantage by the instructor includes the desire for personal  gain, the desire for personal comfort or security, the desire  for group approval, and the achievement of a favorable  self-image.  

Negative motivation may engender fear, and be perceived  by the student as a threat. While negative motivation may  be useful in certain situations, characteristically it is not  as effective in promoting efficient learning as positive  motivation.  

Positive motivation is essential to true learning. Negative  motivation in the form of reproofs or threats should be  avoided with all but the most overconfident and impulsive  students. Slumps in learning are often due to declining  motivation. Motivation does not remain at a uniformly  high level. It may be affected by outside influences, such as  physical or mental disturbances or inadequate instruction.  The instructor should strive to maintain motivation at the  highest possible level. In addition, the instructor should be  alert to detect and counter any lapses in motivation.  

# Levels of Learning  

Levels of learning may be classified in any number of ways.  Four basic levels have traditionally been included in flight  instructor training:  

•  Rote—the ability to repeat something back which  was learned but not understood. An example of this  may be the student who reads and can repeat back  the applicable provision of 14 CFR section 91.119,  Minimum Safe Altitudes, but has no concept of how  this may affect their flight. •  Understanding—to comprehend or grasp the nature or  meaning of something. Once a student has received  proper instruction on performing a steep descent,  and has some experience controlling the balloon in  straight and level flight, he can consolidate those  old and new perceptions into an insight on how to  make a steep approach. At this point, the student has  developed an understanding of the procedure for the  steep approach. •  Application—the act of putting something to use that  has been learned and understood. When the student  understands the procedure for entering and performing  a steep approach to the ground, has had the maneuver  demonstrated, and has practiced the approach until  consistency has been achieved, the student has  developed the skill to apply what has been learned.  This is a major level of learning, and one at which the  instructor is too often willing to stop. •  Correlation—associating what has been learned,  understood, and applied with previous or subsequent  learning. The correlation level of learning, which  should be the objective of aviation instruction, is that  level at which the student becomes able to associate an  element which has been learned with other segments  or blocks or learning.  

Most training is conducted in such a manner that the student  never progresses past the rote and understanding levels. This  is an unacceptable procedure, as practical testing requires the  student to perform at the application and correlation levels.  Failing to bring the student to those levels is incomplete  instruction, and does not provide a complete training  experience.  

# Transfer of Learning  

During a learning experience, the student may be aided by  things learned previously. On the other hand, it is sometimes  apparent that previous learning interferes with the current  learning task. Consider the learning of two skills. If the  learning of skill A helps to learn skill B, positive transfer  occurs. If learning skill A hinders the learning of skill B,  negative transfer occurs. It should be noted that the learning  of skill B may affect the retention or proficiency of skill A,  either positively or negatively. While these processes may  help substantiate the interference theory of forgetting, they  are still concerned with the transfer of learning.  

Many aspects of teaching profit by this type of transfer.  It may explain why students of apparently equal ability  have differing success in certain areas. Negative transfer  may hinder the learning of some; positive transfer may  help others. This points to a need to know a student’s past  experience and what has already been learned. In lesson and  syllabus development, instructors should plan for transfer of  learning by organizing course materials and individual lesson  materials in a meaningful sequence. Each phase should help  the student learn what is to follow.  

# Habit Formation  

The formation of correct habits from the beginning of any  learning process is essential to further learning and for correct  performance after the completion of training. Remember that  primacy is one of the fundamental principles of learning.  Therefore, it is the instructor’s responsibility to insist on  correct techniques and procedures from the outset of training  to provide proper habit patterns. It is much easier to foster  proper habits from the beginning of training than to correct  faulty ones later.  

Due to the high level of knowledge and skill required  in aviation for pilots, training has traditionally followed  a building block concept. This means new learning and  habits are based on a solid foundation of experience and/or  old learning. As knowledge and skill increase, there is an  expanding base upon which to build for the future.  

# Theories of Forgetting  

A consideration of why people forget may point the way to  help them remember. Several theories account for forgetting,  including disuse and interference.  

# Disuse  

The theory of disuse suggests that a person forgets those  things which are not used. The high school or college  graduate is saddened by the lack of factual data retained  several years after graduation. Since the things which are  remembered are those used on the job, a person concludes  that forgetting is the result of disuse. But the explanation  is not quite so simple. Experimental studies show that a  hypnotized person can describe specific details of an event  which normally is beyond recall. Apparently the memory is  there, locked in the recesses of the mind. The difficulty is  summoning it up to consciousness.  

# Interference  

The basis of the interference theory is that people forget  something because a certain experience has overshadowed  it, or that the learning of similar things has intervened.  This theory might explain how the range of experiences  after graduation from school causes a person to forget or to  lose knowledge. In other words, new events displace many  things that had been learned. From experiments, at least two  conclusions about interference may be drawn. First, similar  material seems to interfere with memory more than dissimilar  material; and second, material not well learned suffers most  from interference.  

# The Teaching Process  

Effective teaching is based on principles of learning which  have been previously discussed in this chapter. The learning  process is not easily separated into a definite number of steps.  Sometimes, learning occurs almost instantaneously, and other  times it is acquired only through long, patient study and  diligent practice. The teaching process, on the other hand,  can be divided into steps. Although there is disagreement  about the number of steps, examination of the various  lists of steps in the teaching process reveals that different  authors are saying essentially the same thing: the teaching  of new material can be reduced to preparation, presentation,  application, and review and evaluation.  [Figure 10-6]  

When beginning the teaching process, it may be helpful if  the instructor remembers that in order to provide a “holistic,”  or complete, approach to aviation training, it is necessary  to teach more than just the “how-to” of flying. Too many  times, the entire focus of flight training is spent on the  mechanical aspects of performing a maneuver; it may be a  better approach to also include and discuss the “why” of an  action, to assist the student in gaining a better understanding  of the flight process.  

# Preparation  

For each lesson or instructional period, the instructor must  prepare a lesson plan. Traditionally, this plan includes a  

![](images/31c797a8fd4fb39b49f2e0d8aa8967c3b7d06fabb0c7335771f14fa497969137.jpg)  
Figure 10-6.  The teaching process consists of four basic principles.  

statement of lesson objectives, the procedures and facilities  to be used during the lesson, the specific goals to be attained,  and the means to be used for review and evaluation. The  lesson plan should also include home study or other special  preparation to be done by the student. The instructor should  make certain that all necessary supplies, materials, and  equipment needed for the lesson are readily available and that  the equipment is operating properly. Preparation of the lesson  plan may be accomplished after reference to the syllabus or  practical test standards (PTS), or it may be in a preprinted  form as prepared by a publisher of training materials. These  documents list general objectives that are to be accomplished.  Objectives are needed to bring the unit of instruction into  focus. The instructor can organize the overall instructional  plan by writing down the objectives and making certain that  they flow in a logical sequence from beginning to end. The  objectives allow the instructor to structure the training and  permit the student to see clearly what is required along the  way.  

# Performance-Based Objectives  

One good way to write lesson plans is to begin by formulating  performance-based objectives. The instructor uses the  objectives as listed in the syllabus or the appropriate PTS  as the beginning point for establishing performance-based  objectives. These objectives are very helpful in delineating  exactly what needs to be done and how it is done during each  lesson. Once the performance-based objectives are written,  most of the work of writing a final lesson plan is completed.  One useful thought is the utilization of the “DAM principle”;  objectives, as well as goals, should be difficult, attainable,  and measurable.  

Performance-based objectives are used to set measurable,  reasonable standards that describe the desired performance  of the student. This usually involves the term behavioral  objective, although it may be referred to as a performance,  instructional, or educational objective. All refer to the same  thing, the behavior of the student.  

Performance-based objectives consist of three parts:  description of the skill or behavior, conditions, and criteria.  Each part is required and must be stated in a way that  leaves every reader with the same picture of the objective,  how it is performed, and to what level of performance.  [Figure 10-7]  

Use of performance-based objectives also provides the  student with a better understanding of the big picture, as well  as knowledge of exactly what is expected. This overview  can alleviate a significant source of frustration on the part  of the student.  

![](images/97b1074f42325d1d21201c3e883aa53f8521a5d7252e836b7708d638f38c3ca1.jpg)  
Figure 10-7.   Performance-based objectives are made up of a  description of the skill or behavior, conditions, and criteria.  

# Presentation  

Instructors have several methods of presentation from  which to choose. The nature of the subject matter and the  objective in teaching it normally determine the method of  presentation.  

The lecture method is suitable for presenting new material,  for summarizing ideas, and for showing relationships  between theory and practice. For example, it is suitable for  the presentation of a ground school lesson on performance  planning. This method is most effective when accompanied  by instructional aids and training devices. In the case of a  discussion on performance planning, a chalkboard, a marker  board, or flip chart could be used effectively.  

The demonstration-performance method is desirable for  teaching a skill, such as instruction on most flight maneuvers.  Showing a student pilot how to perform a steep descent, for  example, would be appropriate for this method. The instructor  would first demonstrate the maneuver, and then have the  student attempt the same maneuver.  

Another form of presentation is the guided discussion  which is used in a classroom situation. It is a good method  for encouraging active participation of the students. It is  especially helpful in teaching subjects such as safety and  emergency procedures where students can use initiative and  imagination in addressing problem areas.  

# Review and Application  

Application is where the student uses what the instructor  has presented. After a classroom presentation, the student  may be asked to explain the new material. The student also  may be asked to perform a procedure or operation that has  just been demonstrated. In most instructional situations, the  instructor’s explanation and demonstration activities are  alternated with student performance efforts. The instructor  makes a presentation and then asks the student to try the same  procedure or operation.  

Usually the instructor has to interrupt the student’s efforts  for corrections and further demonstrations. This is necessary,  because it is very important that each student perform the  maneuver or operation the right way the first few times. This  is when habits are established. Faulty habits are difficult to  correct and must be addressed as soon as possible. Flight  instructors in particular must be aware of this problem since  students do a lot of their practice without an instructor. Only  after reasonable competence has been demonstrated should  the student be allowed to practice certain maneuvers on solo  flights. Then, the student can practice the maneuver again and  again until correct performance becomes almost automatic.  Periodic review and evaluation by the instructor is necessary  to ensure that the student has not acquired any bad habits.  

# Teaching Methods  

The information presented in previous sections has been  largely theoretical, emphasizing concepts and principles  pertinent to the learning process, human behavior, and  effective communication in education and training programs.  This knowledge, if properly used, enables instructors to be  more confident, efficient, and successful. The discussion  which follows departs from the theoretical with some specific  recommendations for the actual conduct of the teaching  process. Included are methods and procedures which have  been tested and found to be effective.  

Personal computers are a part of every segment of our  society today. Since a number of computer-based programs  are currently available from publishers of aviation training  materials, a brief description of new technologies and how  to use them effectively is provided near the end of this  section.  

# Organizing Material  

Regardless of the teaching method used, an instructor must  properly organize the material. Lessons do not stand alone  within a course of training. There must be a plan of action  to lead instructors and their students through the course in  a logical manner toward the desired goal. Usually the goal  for students is a certificate or rating. A systematic plan of  action requires the use of an appropriate training syllabus.  

Generally, the syllabus must contain a description of each  lesson, including objectives and completion standards.  

Although instructors may develop their own syllabus, in  practice many instructors use a group-developed syllabus  such as that developed and available through the Balloon  Federation of America. Thus, the main concern of the  instructor usually is the more manageable task of organizing a  block of training with integrated lesson plans. The traditional  organization of a lesson plan is: introduction, development,  and conclusion.  

# Introduction  

The introduction sets the stage for everything to come.  Efforts in this area pay great dividends in terms of quality  of instruction. In brief, the introduction is made up of three  elements—attention, motivation, and an overview of what  is to be covered.  [Figure 10-8]  

![Figure 10-8.   The introduction prepares the students to receive the  information in the lesson. ](images/deadd208b7923236d4a099114df8f2a977faa07b23a9525c8563c06b64d51290.jpg)  

# Attention  

The purpose of the attention element is to focus each student’s  attention on the lesson. The instructor may begin by telling a  story, making an unexpected or surprising statement, asking  a question, or telling a joke. Any of these may be appropriate  at one time or another. Regardless of which is used, it  should relate to the subject and establish a background for  developing the learning outcomes. Telling a story or a joke  that is not related in some way to the subject can only distract  from the lesson. The main concern is to gain the attention of  everyone and concentrate on the subject.  

# Motivation  

The purpose of the motivation element is to offer the student  specific reasons why the lesson content is important to know,  understand, apply, or perform. For example, the instructor  may talk about an occurrence where the knowledge in the  lesson was applied. Or the instructor may remind the student  of an upcoming test on the material. This motivation should  appeal to each student personally and engender a desire to  learn the material.  

# Overview  

Every lesson introduction should contain an overview that  explains what is to be covered during the period. A clear,  concise presentation of the objective and the key ideas gives  the students a road map of the route to be followed. A good  visual aid can help the instructor show the students the path  that they are to travel. The introduction should be free of  stories, humor, or incidents that do not help the students focus  their attention on the lesson objective. Also, the instructor  should avoid a long apologetic introduction, because it only  serves to dampen the students’ interest in the lesson.  

# Development  

Development is the main part of the lesson. Here, the  instructor develops the subject matter in a manner that helps  the students achieve the desired learning outcomes. The  instructor must logically organize the material to show the  relationships of the main points. The instructor usually shows  these primary relationships by developing the main points  in one of the following ways: from past to present, simple  to complex, known to unknown, and most frequently used  to least frequently used.  

Under each main point in a lesson, the subordinate points  should lead naturally from one to the other. With this  arrangement, each point leads logically into, and serves as a  reminder of, the next. Meaningful transitions from one main  point to another keep the students oriented, aware of where  they have been, and where they are going. This permits  effective sorting or categorizing chunks of information in  the working or short-term memory. Organizing a lesson so  the students grasp the logical relationships of ideas is not  an easy task, but it is necessary if the students are to learn  and remember what they have learned. Poorly organized  information is of little or no value to the student because it  cannot be readily understood or remembered.  

# Conclusion  

An effective conclusion retraces the important elements of  the lesson and relates them to the objective. This review and  wrap-up of ideas reinforces student learning and improves  the retention of what has been learned. New ideas should not  be introduced in the conclusion because at this point they are  likely to confuse the students.  

By organizing the lesson material into a logical format, the  instructor has maximized the opportunity for students to retain  the desired information. However, each teaching situation is  unique. The setting and purpose of the lesson determines  which teaching method—lecture, guided discussion,  demonstration-performance, cooperative or group learning,  computer-based training, or a combination—is used.  

# Lecture Method  

The lecture method is the most widely used form of  presentation. Every instructor should know how to develop  and present a lecture.  [Figure 10-9]  Lectures are used for  introduction of new subjects, summarizing ideas, showing  relationships between theory and practice, and reemphasizing  main points. The lecture method is adaptable to many  different settings, including either small or large groups.  Lectures also may be used to introduce a unit of instruction  or a complete training program. Finally, lectures may be  combined with other teaching methods to give added meaning  and direction.  

![](images/7291389385f1167633ae7c6ccf13830dac66b7b74fb7b907ae7b821e58c86d7f.jpg)  
Figure 10-9.   Instructors should try a dry run with another instructor  to get a feel for the lecture presentation.  

The lecture method of teaching needs to be very flexible  since it may be used in different ways. For example, there  are several types of lectures such as the illustrated talk where  the speaker relies heavily on visual aids to convey ideas to  the listeners. With a briefing, the speaker presents a concise  array of facts to the listeners who normally do not expect  elaboration of supporting material. During a formal lecture,  the speaker’s purpose is to inform, to persuade, or to entertain  with little or no verbal participation by the students. When  using a teaching lecture, the instructor plans and delivers an  oral presentation in a manner that allows some participation  by the students and helps direct them toward the desired  learning outcomes.  

# Demonstration-Performance Method  

This method of teaching is based on the simple, yet sound  principle that we learn by doing. Students learn physical  or mental skills by actually performing those skills under  supervision. An individual learns to write by writing, and  to fly a balloon by actually performing flight maneuvers.  Students also learn mental skills, such as speed reading, by  this method. Skills requiring the use of tools, machines, and  equipment are particularly well suited to this instructional  method.  

Every instructor should recognize the importance of student  performance in the learning process. Early in a lesson that  is to include demonstration and performance, the instructor  should identify the most important learning outcomes. Next,  explain and demonstrate the steps involved in performing the  skill being taught. Then, allow students time to practice each  step, so they can increase their ability to perform the skill.  

The demonstration-performance method of teaching has five  essential phases:  

•  Explanation Phase—explanations must be clear,  pertinent to the objectives of the particular lesson to  be presented, and based on the known experience and  knowledge of the student. In addition to the necessary  actions to be performed, the instructor should describe  the end result of these efforts. •  Demonstration Phase—the instructor must show the  student the actions necessary to perform a skill. •  Student Performance and Instructor Supervision  Phases—these two phases, which involve separate  actions, are performed concurrently, and are thus  described under a single heading. The first action  is the performance by the student of the physical  or mental skill that had been explained. The second  is the instructor’s supervision, insuring that errors  are immediately corrected to standards already  prescribed. •  Evaluation Phase—in this final phase, the instructor  judges student performance. The student performs  whatever competence has been attained, and the  instructor evaluates and discovers just how well the  skill has been learned. Form this measurement of  

student achievement, the instructor determines the  effectiveness of the instruction.  

# Computer-based Training  

Many new and innovative training technologies are available  today. One of the most significant is computer-based training 

 (CBT)—the use of the personal computer as a training device. 

 [Figure 10-10]  CBT is sometimes called computer-based  instruction (CBI). The terms CBT and CBI are synonymous  and may be used interchangeably.

Figure 10-10.   The instructor must continually monitor student  performance when using CBT, as with all instructional aids.  

Common examples of CBT with specific application to  balloon flight training include the computer versions of the  test prep study guides which are useful for preparation for  the FAA knowledge tests. These programs typically allow  the students to select a test, complete the questions, and find  out how they did on the test. The student may then conduct a  review of questions missed. An excellent resource for balloon  training is the web site webexams.com; this provides the  student with the ability to take practice exams, which assists  in determining weaknesses in training.  

While computers provide many training advantages, they  also have limitations. Improper or excessive use of CBT  should be avoided. Computer-based training should not be  used by the instructor as stand-alone training any more than a  textbook or video. Like video or a textbook, CBT is an aid to  the instructor. The instructor must be actively involved with  the students when using instructional aids. This involvement  should include close supervision, questions, examinations,  quizzes, or guided discussions on the subject matter.  

# Techniques of Flight Instruction  

In this section, the demonstration-performance method is  applied to the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction,  as well as the integrated technique of flight instruction.  

# The Telling-and-Doing Technique  

This technique has been in use for a long time and is very  effective in teaching physical skills. Flight instructors find  it valuable in teaching procedures and maneuvers. The  telling-and-doing technique is actually a variation of the  demonstration-performance method. In the telling-and-doing  technique, the first step is preparation. This is particularly  important in flight instruction because of the introduction  of new maneuvers or procedures. The flight instructor  needs to be well prepared and highly organized if complex  maneuvers and procedures are to be taught effectively. The  student must be intellectually and psychologically ready for  the learning activity. The preparation step is accomplished  prior to the flight lesson with a discussion of lesson objectives  and completion standards, as well as a thorough preflight  briefing.  [Figure 10-11]  

# Instructor Tells-Instructor Does  

Presentation is the second step in the teaching process. It  is a continuation of preparing the student, which began in  the detailed preflight discussion, and now continues by a  carefully planned demonstration and accompanying verbal  explanation of the procedure or maneuver. It is important that  the demonstration conforms to the explanation as closely as  possible. In addition, it should be demonstrated in the same  sequence in which it was explained to avoid confusion and  provide reinforcement.  

# Student Tells-Instructor Does  

This is a transition between the second and third steps in the  teaching process. It is the most obvious departure from the  demonstration-performance technique, and may provide the  most significant advantages. In this step, the student actually  plays the role of instructor, telling the instructor what to do  and how to do it. Two benefits accrue from this step. First,  being freed from the need to concentrate on performance of  the maneuver and from concern about its outcome, the student  should be able to organize his or her thoughts regarding the  steps involved and the techniques to be used. In the process  of explaining the maneuver as the instructor performs it,  perceptions begin to develop into insights. Mental habits  begin to form with repetition of the instructions previously  received. Second, with the student doing the talking, the  instructor is able to evaluate the student’s understanding of  the factors involved in performance of the maneuver.  

# Student Tells-Student Does  

Application is the third step in the teaching process. This is  where learning takes place and where performance habits  are formed. If the student has been adequately prepared  (first step) and the procedure or maneuver fully explained  and demonstrated (second step), meaningful learning occurs.  The instructor should be alert during the student’s practice to  detect any errors in technique and to prevent the formation  of faulty habits.  

![](images/8361a214661d309356b1bb1a8a05d4fa99294a75f485e046f71d9bee9bbffeaf.jpg)  
Figure 10-11.   Comparison of steps in the teaching process, the demonstration-performance method, and the telling-and-doing technique.  This comparison shows the similarities, as well as some differences. The main difference in the telling-and-doing technique is the important  transition, student tells—instructor does, which occurs between the second and third step.  

At the same time, the student should be encouraged to think  about what to do during the performance of a maneuver, until  it becomes habitual. In this step, the thinking is done verbally.  This focuses concentration on the task to be accomplished,  so that total involvement in the maneuver is fostered.  

# Student Does-Instructor Evaluates  

The fourth step of the teaching process is review and  evaluation. In this step, the instructor reviews what has  been covered during the instructional flight and determines  to what extent the student has met the objectives outlined  during the preflight discussion. Since the student no longer  is required to talk through the maneuver during this step,  the instructor should be satisfied that the student is well  prepared and understands the task before starting. This last  step is identical to the final step used in the demonstration- performance method. The instructor observes as the student  performs, then makes appropriate comments.  

At the conclusion of the evaluation phase, record the student’s  performance and verbally advise each student of the progress  made toward the objectives. Regardless of how well a skill  is taught, there may still be failures. Since success is a  motivating factor, instructors should be positive in revealing  results. When pointing out areas that need improvement, offer  concrete suggestions that help. The instructor should make  every effort to end the evaluation on a positive note.  

# Critique and Evaluation  

Since every student is different and each learning situation is  unique, the actual outcome may not be entirely as expected.  The instructor must be able to appraise student performance  and convey this information back to the student. No skill is  more important to an instructor than the ability to analyze,  appraise, and judge student performance. The student quite  naturally looks to the instructor for guidance, analysis,  appraisal, as well as suggestions for improvement and  encouragement. This feedback from instructor to student is  called a critique.  

In most cases, a critique should be conducted in private. It  should come immediately after a student’s performance,  while the details of the performance are easy to recall. An  instructor may critique any activity which a student performs  or practices to improve skill, proficiency, and learning.  

Two common misconceptions about the critique should be  corrected at the outset. First, a critique is not a step in the  grading process. It is a step in the learning process. Second,  a critique is not necessarily negative in content. It considers  the good along with the bad, the individual parts, relationships  of the individual parts, and the overall performance. A  critique can, and usually should, be as varied in content as  the performance being critiqued.  

# Purpose of a Critique  

A critique should provide the student with something  constructive upon which he or she can work or build. It  should provide direction and guidance to raise their level of  performance. Students must understand the purpose of the  critique; otherwise, they are unlikely to accept the criticism  offered and little improvement will result.  

# Methods of Critique  

The critique of student performance is always the instructor’s  responsibility, and it can never be delegated in its entirety.  The instructor can add interest and variety to the criticism  through the use of imagination and by drawing on the talents,  ideas, and opinions of others. There are several useful  methods of conducting a critique, two of which have specific  application to balloon flight instruction.  

# Student-Led Critique  

The instructor asks a student to lead the critique. The  instructor can specify the pattern of organization and the  techniques or can leave it to the discretion of the student  leader. Because of the inexperience of the participants in the  lesson area, student-led critiques may not be efficient, but  they can generate student interest and learning and, on the  whole, be effective.  

# Self-Critique  

A student is required to critique personal performance.  Like all other methods, a self-critique must be controlled  and supervised by the instructor. Whatever the methods  employed, the instructor must not leave controversial issues  unresolved, nor erroneous impressions uncorrected. The  instructor must make allowances for the student’s relative  inexperience. Normally, the instructor should reserve time  at the end of the student critique to cover those areas that  might have been omitted, not emphasized sufficiently, or  considered worth repeating. One variant of this method is  for the instructor to ask the student to name three negative  aspects of the flight training period, and discuss corrective  action. Then, the instructor asks for three positive aspects  of the training. This also indicates to the instructor whether  or not the student is able to analyze their performance, in  relation to the standards sought.  

# Ground Rules for Critiquing  

There are a number of rules and techniques to keep in mind  when conducting a critique. The following list can be applied,  regardless of the type of critiquing activity.  

•  Avoid trying to cover too much. A few well-made  points usually is more beneficial than a large number  

of points that are not developed adequately. •  Allow time for a summary of the critique to  reemphasize the most important things a student  should remember. •  Never allow yourself to be maneuvered into the  unpleasant position of defending criticism. If the  criticism is honest, objective, constructive, and  comprehensive, no defense should be necessary. •  If part of the critique is written, make certain that it is  consistent with the oral portion.  

Although, at times, a critique may seem like an evaluation,  it is not. Both student and instructor should consider it as an  integral part of the lesson. It normally is a wrap-up of the  lesson. A good critique closes the chapter on the lesson and  sets the stage for the next lesson.  

# Characteristics of an Effective Critique  

In order to provide direction and raise the students’ level  of performance, the critique must be factual and be aligned  with the completion standards of the lesson. This, of course,  is because the critique is a part of the learning process. Some  of the requirements for an effective critique are shown in  Figure 10-12 .  

•  Objective—the effective critique is focused on student  performance. It should be objective, and not reflect  the personal opinions, likes, dislikes, and biases of  the instructor. If a critique is to be objective, it must  be honest; it must be based on the performance as it  was, not as it could have been, or as the instructor and  student wished that it had been.  

•  Flexible—the instructor needs to examine the entire  performance of a student and the context in which  it is accomplished. Sometimes a good student turns  in a poor performance and a poor student turns in a  good one. A friendly student may suddenly become  hostile, or a hostile student may suddenly become  friendly and cooperative. The instructor must fit the  tone, technique, and content of the critique to the  occasion, as well as the student. A critique should  be designed and executed so that the instructor can  allow for variables. An effective critique is one that  is flexible enough to satisfy the requirements of the  moment.  

•  Acceptable—before students willingly accept their  instructor’s criticism, they must first accept the  

![](images/18b5ea10c098eab4677a33356a3d2b4e5412cef17b6180746a529a1c49d76874.jpg)  
Figure 10-12.  Elements of an effective critique.  

instructor. Students must have confidence in the  instructor’s qualifications, teaching ability, sincerity,  competence, and authority. If a critique is presented  fairly, with authority, conviction, sincerity, and from  a position of recognizable competence, the student  probably accepts it as such. Instructors should not rely  on their position to make a critique more acceptable  to their students.  

•  Comprehensive—a comprehensive critique is not  necessarily a long one, nor must it treat every aspect  of the performance in detail. The instructor must  decide whether the greater benefit comes from a  discussion of a few major points or a number of minor  points. The instructor might critique what most needs  improvement, or only what the student can reasonably  be expected to improve. An effective critique covers  strengths as well as weaknesses.  

•  Constructive—a critique is pointless unless the student  profits from it. The instructor should give positive  guidance for correcting the fault and strengthening  the weakness. Negative criticism that does not point  toward improvement or a higher level of performance  should be omitted from a critique altogether.  

•  Organized—unless a critique follows some pattern  of organization, a series of otherwise valid comments  may lose their impact. Almost any pattern is acceptable  as long as it is logical and makes sense to the student  as well as to the instructor. An effective organizational  pattern might be the sequence of the performance  itself. Sometimes a critique can profitably begin at the  point where a demonstration failed and work backward  through the steps that led to the failure.  

•  Thoughtful—an effective critique reflects the  instructor’s thoughtfulness toward the student’s need  for self-esteem, recognition, and approval from others.  The instructor should never minimize the inherent  dignity and importance of the individual. Ridicule,  anger, or fun at the expense of the student have no  place in a critique. While being straightforward  and honest, the instructor should always respect the  student’s personal feelings.  

•  Specific—the instructor’s comments and  recommendations should be specific, rather than  general. The student needs to focus on something  concrete. If the instructor has a clear, well-founded,  and supportable idea in mind, it should be expressed  with firmness and authority in terms that cannot be  misunderstood.  

# Evaluation  

Whenever learning takes place, the result is a definable,  observable, measurable change in behavior. The purpose of  an evaluation is to determine how a student is progressing in  the course. Evaluation is concerned with defining, observing,  and measuring or judging this new behavior. Evaluation  normally occurs before, during, and after instruction; it is an  integral part of the learning process. During instruction, some  sort of evaluation is essential to determine what the student  is learning and how well they are learning it. The instructor’s  evaluation may be the result of observations of the students’  overall performance, or it may be accomplished as either a  spontaneous or planned evaluation, such as an oral quiz,  written test, or skill performance test.  [Figure 10-13]  

![](images/37f2ccd9c71a137ae76e18b1a5283e509c0bd264c9bd77d4ee59e77e2835d32d.jpg)  
Figure 10-13.   There are three common types of evaluations that  instructors may use.  

# Oral Quizzes  

The most used means of evaluation is the direct or indirect  oral questioning of the student by the instructor. Questions  may be loosely classified as fact questions and thought  questions. The answer to a fact question is based on memory  or recall. This type of question usually concerns who, what,  when, and where. Thought questions usually involve why  or how, and require the student to combine knowledge of  facts with an ability to analyze situations, solve problems,  and arrive at conclusions. Proper quizzing by the instructor  can have a number of desirable results.  

# Characteristics of Effective Questions  

An effective oral quiz requires some preparation. The  instructor should devise and write pertinent questions in  advance. One method is to place them in the lesson plan.  Prepared questions merely serve as a framework, and as  the lesson progresses, should be supplemented by such  impromptu questions as the instructor considers appropriate.  To be effective, questions must apply to the subject of  instruction. Unless the question pertains strictly to the  particular training being conducted, it serves only to confuse  the students and divert their thoughts to an unrelated subject.  An effective question should be brief and concise, but also  clear and definite.  

Effective questions must be adapted to the ability, experience,  and stage of training of the students. Effective questions  center on only one idea. A single question should be limited  to who, what, when, where, how, or why, not a combination.  Effective questions must present a challenge to the students.  Questions of suitable difficulty serve to stimulate learning.  Effective questions demand and deserve the use of proper  English.  

# Answering Questions from Students  

Responses to student questions must also conform with  certain considerations if answering is to be an effective  teaching method. The question must be clearly understood by  the instructor before an answer is attempted. The instructor  should display interest in the student’s question and frame  an answer that is as direct and accurate as possible. After  the instructor completes a response, it should be determined  whether or not the student’s request for information has  been completely answered, and if the student is satisfied  with the answer.  

Occasionally, a student asks a question that the instructor  cannot answer. In such cases, the instructor should freely  admit not knowing the answer, but should promise to get the  answer or, if practicable, offer to help the student look it up  in available references.  

# Written Tests  

As evaluation devices, written tests are only as good as the  knowledge and proficiency of the test writer. This section is  intended to provide the flight instructor with only the basic  concepts of written test design.  

# Characteristics of a Good Test  

A test is a set of questions, problems, or exercises for  determining whether a person has a particular knowledge or  skill. A test can consist of just one test item, but it usually  consists of a number of test items. A test item measures a  single objective and calls for a single response. The test  could be as simple as the correct answer to an essay question  or as complex as completing a knowledge or practical test.  Regardless of the underlying purpose, effective tests share  certain characteristics. For a full list of these characteristics,  refer to the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook.  

# Test Development  

When testing aviation students, the instructor is usually  concerned more with criterion-referenced testing than norm- referenced testing. Criterion-referenced testing evaluates  each student’s performance against a carefully written,  measurable, standard or criterion. Norm-referenced testing  measures a student’s performance against the performance  of other students. There is little or no concern about the  student’s performance in relation to the performance of other  students. The FAA knowledge and practical tests for pilots  are all criterion referenced because in aviation training it is  necessary to measure student performance against a high  standard of proficiency consistent with safety.  

# Presolo Knowledge Tests  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61  requires the satisfactory completion of a presolo knowledge  test prior to solo flight. The presolo knowledge test is  required to be administered, graded, and all incorrect answers  reviewed by the instructor providing the training prior to  endorsing the student pilot certificate and logbook for solo  flight. The regulation states that the presolo knowledge test  must include questions applicable to 14 CFR parts 61 and 91  and on the flight characteristics and operational limitations  of the make and model aircraft to be flown.  

The content and number of test questions are to be determined  by the flight instructor. An adequate sampling of the general  operating rules should be included. In addition, a sufficient  number of specific questions should be asked to ensure the  student has the knowledge to safely operate the aircraft in  the local environment.  

Specific procedures for developing test questions are covered  in the Aviation Instructor’s Handbook, but a review of some  items as they apply to the presolo knowledge test are in  order. Though selection-type (usually referred to as multiple- choice) test items are easier to grade, it is recommended that  supply-type (or “fill in the blank”) test items be used for  the portions of the presolo knowledge test where specific  knowledge is to be tested. One problem with supply-type test  items is difficulty in assigning the appropriate grade.  

Since solo flight requires a thorough working knowledge  of the different conditions likely to be encountered on the  solo flight, it is important that the test properly evaluate this  area. In this way, the instructor can see any areas that are  not adequately understood and can then cover them in the  review of the test. Selection-type test items do not allow  the instructor to evaluate the student’s knowledge beyond  the immediate scope of the test items. The supply-type test  item measures much more adequately the knowledge of the  student, and lends itself very well to presolo testing.  

The instructor must keep a record of the test results for at  least three (3) years, as required by the provisions of 14 CFR  section 61.189. The record should at least include the date,  name of the student, and the results of the test.  

# Performance Tests  

The flight instructor does not administer the practical test for  a pilot certificate. Flight instructors do get involved with the  same skill or performance testing that is measured in these  tests. Performance testing is desirable for evaluating training  that involves an operation, a procedure, or a process. The  job of the instructor is to prepare the student to take these  tests. Therefore, each element of the practical test has been  evaluated prior to an applicant taking the practical exam.  

The purpose of the practical test standards (PTS) is to delineate  the standards by which FAA inspectors and designated pilot  examiners conduct tests for ratings and certificates. The  standards are in accordance with the requirements of 14 CFR  parts 61 and 91 and other FAA publications including the  Aeronautical Information Manual and pertinent advisory  circulars and handbooks. The objective of the PTS is to ensure  the certification of pilots at a high level of performance and  proficiency, consistent with safety.  

Since every task in the PTS may be covered on the check  ride, the instructor must evaluate all of the tasks before  certifying the applicant to take the practical test. While this  evaluation is not totally formal in nature, it should adhere to  criterion-referenced testing. Although the instructor should  always train the student to the very highest level possible, the  evaluation of the student is only in relation to the standards  listed in the PTS. The instructor, and the examiner, should  also keep in mind that the standards are set at a level that is  already very high. They are not minimum standards and they  do not represent a floor of acceptability. In other words, the  standards are the acceptable level that must be met and there  are no requirements to exceed them.  

# Planning Instructional Activities  

Any instructional activity must be well planned and organized  if it is to proceed in an effective manner. Much of the basic  planning necessary for the flight instructor is provided by  the knowledge and proficiency requirements published in  14 CFR, approved school syllabi, and the various texts,  manuals, and training courses available. This section reviews  the planning required by the instructor as it relates to four  key topics—course of training, blocks of learning, training  syllabus, and lesson plans.  

# Course of Training  

In education, a course of training may be defined as a complete  series of studies leading to attainment of a specific goal. The  goal might be a certificate of completion, graduation, or an  academic degree. For example, a student pilot may enroll in  a private pilot certificate course, and upon completion of all  course requirements, be awarded a graduation certificate.  

Other terms closely associated with a course of training  include curriculum, syllabus, and training course outline. In  many cases, these terms are used interchangeably, but there  are important differences.  

A curriculum may be defined as a set of courses in an area  of specialization offered by an educational institution. A  curriculum for a pilot school usually includes courses for  the various pilot certificates and ratings. A syllabus is a  brief or general summary or outline of a course of study. In  aviation, the term “training syllabus” is commonly used. In  this context, a training syllabus is a step-by-step, building  block progression of learning with provisions for regular  review and evaluations at prescribed stages of learning.  The syllabus defines the unit of training, states by objective  what the student is expected to accomplish during the unit of  training, shows an organized plan for instruction, and dictates  the evaluation process for either the unit or stages of learning.  And, finally, a training course outline, within a curriculum,  may be described as the specific content of a particular course.  It normally includes statements of objectives, descriptions  of teaching aids, definitions of evaluating criteria, and  indications of desired outcome.  

# Objectives and Standards  

The overall objective of an aviation training course is  usually well established, and the general standards are  included in various rules and related publications. For  example, eligibility, knowledge, proficiency, and experience  requirements for pilots and maintenance students are  stipulated in the regulations, and the standards are published  in the applicable practical test standards (PTS). It should be  noted, though, that the PTS standards are limited to the most  critical performance tasks. Certification tests do not represent  an entire training syllabus.  

# Blocks of Learning  

After the overall training objectives have been established,  the next step is the identification of the blocks of learning  [Figure 10-14]  which constitute the necessary parts of the  total objective. Just as in building a pyramid, some blocks are  

![](images/3f28f442025ee8f08549e691a934d797f30f28b51ce129ff4836e3739a06b141.jpg)  
Figure 10-14.   The presolo stage, or phase, of private training is comprised of several basic building blocks. These blocks of learning,  which should include coordinated ground and flight training, lead up to the first solo.  

submerged in the structure and never appear on the surface,  but each is an integral and necessary part of the structure.  During the process of identifying the blocks of learning to  be assembled for the proposed training activity, the planner  must also examine each carefully to see that it is truly an  integral part of the structure.  

While determining the overall training objectives is a  necessary first step in the planning process, early identification  of the foundation blocks of learning is also essential. Training  for any such complicated and involved task as piloting  or maintaining an aircraft requires the development and  assembly of many segments or blocks of learning in their  proper relationships. In this way, a student can master the  segments or blocks individually and can progressively  combine these with other related segments until their sum  meets the overall training objectives.  

# Training Syllabus  

There are a number of valid reasons why all flight instructors  should use a training syllabus. As technology advances,  training requirements become more demanding. At the  same time, new and often more complicated rules continue  to be proposed and implemented. In addition, the rules for  instruction in other than an approved flight school are still  quite specific about the type and duration of training. These  factors, along with the continuing growth of aviation, add  to the complexity of aviation training and certification.  

Instructors need a practical guide to help them make sure the  training is accomplished in a logical sequence and that all of  the requirements are completed and properly documented.    A  well organized, comprehensive syllabus can fulfill these  needs.  

# Syllabus Format and Content  

The format and organization of the syllabus may vary, but it  always should be in the form of an abstract or digest of the  course of training. It should contain blocks of learning to be  completed in the most efficient order.  

Since a syllabus is intended to be a summary of a course  of training, it should be fairly brief, yet comprehensive  enough to cover essential information. This information is  usually presented in an outline format with lesson-by-lesson  coverage. Some syllabi include tables to show recommended  training time for each lesson, as well as the overall minimum  time requirements.  

Since effective training relies on organized blocks of learning,  all syllabi should stress well-defined objectives and standards  for each lesson. Appropriate objectives and standards should  be established for the overall course, the separate ground  and flight segments, and for each stage of training. Other  details may be added to a syllabus in order to explain how  to use it and describe the pertinent training and reference  materials. Examples of the training and reference materials  include textbooks, video, compact disks, exams, briefings,  and instructional guides.  

# How To Use a Training Syllabus  

Any practical training syllabus must be flexible, and should  be used primarily as a guide. When necessary, the order of  training can and should be altered to suit the progress of  the student and the demands of special circumstances. For  example, previous experience or different rates of learning  often require some alteration or repetition to fit individual  students. The syllabus also should be flexible enough so it  can be adapted to weather variations and scheduling changes  without disrupting the teaching process or completely  suspending training.  

Effective use of a syllabus requires that it be referred to  throughout the entire course of training. Both the instructor  and the student should have a copy of the approved syllabus.  However, as previously mentioned, a syllabus should not  be adhered to so stringently that it becomes inflexible or  unchangeable. It must be flexible enough to adapt to special  needs of individual students.  

A syllabus lesson may include several other items that add  to or clarify the objective, content, or standards. A lesson  may specify the recommended class time, reference or  study materials, recommended sequence of training, and  study assignment for the next lesson. Both ground and flight  lessons may have explanatory information notes added to  specific lessons.  

While a syllabus is designed to provide a road map showing  how to accomplish the overall objective of a course of  training, it may be useful for other purposes. As already  mentioned, it can be used as a checklist to ensure that required  training has successfully been completed. Thus, a syllabus  can be an effective tool for recordkeeping. Enhanced syllabi,  which also are designed for recordkeeping, can be very  beneficial to the independent instructor.  

A recordkeeping function may be facilitated by boxes or  blank spaces adjacent to the knowledge areas, procedures, or  maneuvers in a flight lesson, much as the syllabus designed  by the Balloon Federation of America does. Most syllabi  introduce each procedure or maneuver in one flight lesson  and review them in subsequent lessons. Some syllabi also  include provisions for grading student performance and  recording both ground and flight training time. Accurate  recordkeeping is necessary to keep both the student and the  instructor informed on the status of training. These records  also serve as a basis for endorsements and recommendations  for knowledge and practical tests.  

Another benefit of using a syllabus is that it helps in  development of lesson plans. A well constructed syllabus  already contains much of the essential information that is  required in a lesson plan, including objectives, content, and  completion standards.  

# Lesson Plans  

A lesson plan is an organized outline for a single instructional  period.  [Figure 10-15]  It is a necessary guide for the  instructor in that it tells what to do, in what order to do it, and  what procedure to use in teaching the material of a lesson.  Lesson plans should be prepared for each training period  and be developed to show specific knowledge and/or skills  to be taught.  

A mental outline of a lesson is not a lesson plan. A lesson plan  should be put into writing. Another instructor should be able  to take the lesson plan and know what to do in conducting  the same period of instruction. When putting it in writing, the  lesson plan can be analyzed from the standpoint of adequacy  and completeness.  

Lesson plans serve many purposes, such as:  

•  Assure a wise selection of material and the elimination  of unimportant details. •  Make certain that due consideration is given to each  part of the lesson. •  Aid the instructor in presenting the material in a  suitable sequence for efficient learning. •  Provide an outline of the teaching procedure to be  used. •  Serve as a means of relating the lesson to the objectives  of the course of training. •  Give the inexperienced instructor confidence. •  Promote uniformity of instruction regardless of the  instructor or the date on which the lesson is given.  

# Characteristics of a Well-Planned Lesson  

The quality of planning affects the quality of results.  Successful professionals understand the price of excellence is  hard work and thorough preparation. The effective instructor  realizes that the time and energy spent in planning and  preparing each lesson is well worth the effort in the long  run.  [Figure 10-16]  

A complete cycle of planning usually includes several  steps. After the objective is determined, the instructor must  research the subject as it is defined by the objective. Once  the research is complete, the instructor must determine the  

![](images/46dcbe74f239b6984641845a99382c84486ea463567e1598ae0034328a1e8d17.jpg)  

method of instruction and identify a useful lesson planning  format. Other steps, such as deciding how to organize the  lesson and selecting suitable support material also must be  accomplished. The final steps include assembling training  aids and writing the lesson plan outline. One technique for  writing the lesson plan outline is to prepare the beginning and  ending first. Then, complete the outline and make revisions  as necessary. The following are some of the important  characteristics that should be reflected in all well-planned  lessons.  

•  Unity—each lesson should be a unified segment  of instruction. A lesson is concerned with certain  limited objectives, which are stated in terms of desired  student learning outcomes. All teaching procedures  and materials should be selected to attain these  objectives. •  Content—each lesson should contain new material.  However, the new facts, principles, procedures,  or skills should be related to the lesson previously  presented. A short review of earlier lessons is usually  necessary, particularly in flight training. •  Scope—each lesson should be reasonable in scope. A  person can master only a few principles or skills at a  time, the number depending on complexity. Presenting  too much material in a lesson results in confusion;  presenting too little material results in inefficiency. •  Practicality—each lesson should be planned in terms  of the conditions under which the training is to be  conducted. Lesson plans for training conducted in a  balloon differ from those conducted in a classroom.  Also, the kinds and quantities of instructional aids  available have a great influence on lesson planning  and instructional procedures. •  Flexibility—although the lesson plan provides an  outline and sequence for the training to be conducted,  a degree of flexibility should be incorporated. For  example, the outline of content may include blank  spaces for add-on material, if required. •  Relation to course of training—each lesson should be  planned and taught so that its relation to the course  objectives are clear to each student. For example, a  lesson on short-field takeoffs and landings should be  related to both the certification and safety objectives  of the course of training. •  Instructional Steps—every lesson, when adequately  developed, lends itself to the four steps of the teaching  process: preparation, presentation, application, and  review and evaluation.  

# How To Use a Lesson Plan Properly Be Familiar With the Lesson Plan  

The instructor should study each step of the plan and should  be thoroughly familiar with as much information related to  the subject as possible.  

# Use the Lesson Plan as a Guide  

The lesson plan is an outline for conducting an instructional  period. It assures that pertinent materials are at hand and  

![](images/e3adc6dfd89f1b3d83761ac838127e12d52c02a8c0ba298d007fd2de2ad25b4a.jpg)  

that the presentation is accomplished with order and unity.  Having a plan prevents the instructor from getting off the  track, omitting essential points, and introducing irrelevant  material. Students have a right to expect an instructor to give  the same attention to teaching that they give to learning. The  most certain means of achieving teaching success is to have  a carefully thought-out lesson plan.  

# Adapt the Lesson Plan to the Class or Student  

In teaching a ground school period, the instructor may find  that the procedures outlined in the lesson plan are not leading  to the desired results. In this situation, the instructor should  change the approach. There is no certain way of predicting  the reactions of different groups of students. An approach  that has been successful with one group may not be equally  successful with another.  

A lesson plan for an instructional flight period should  be appropriate to the background, flight experience, and  ability of the particular student. A lesson plan may have to  be modified considerably during flight, due to deficiencies  in the student’s knowledge or poor mastery of elements  essential to the effective completion of the lesson. In some  cases, the entire lesson plan may have to be abandoned in  favor of review.  

# Revise the Lesson Plan Periodically  

After a lesson plan has been prepared for a training period,  a continuous revision may be necessary. This is true for a  number of reasons, including availability or non-availability  of instructional aids, changes in regulations, new manuals  and textbooks, and changes in the state-of-the art among  others.  

In spite of need for varied subject coverage, diverse teaching  methods, and relatively high level learning objectives, most  aviation lesson plans have the common characteristics already  discussed. They all should include objectives, content to  support the objectives, and completion standards. Various  authorities often divide the main headings into several  subheadings, and terminology, even for the main headings,  varies extensively. For example, completion standards may  be called assessment, review and feedback, performance  evaluation, or some other related term.  

# Chapter Summary  

It is an unfortunate truth that many commercial balloon  pilots are not as qualified and prepared for their instructional  responsibility as they should be. All commercial pilots are  required to study the necessary principles of instruction in  order to pass their knowledge test, and must perform a lesson  on a flight maneuver as a part of the practical test.  

A commercial pilot who chooses to instruct needs to hold  himself to the same standards as the rest of the aviation  community. He should provide compete and thorough flight  training, as well as insuring that proper ground training is  conducted, so that the prospective pilot is well-grounded in  all facets of aviation. To do less minimizes the instructor’s  role in the educational process, and perpetuates poor training  in the ballooning community.  

The information in this chapter provides a basis for an  instructor’s knowledge of the skills and techniques of the  instructional process. It is the responsibility of each individual  instructor to expand on that knowledge, and provide the best  instruction possible.  

# Lesson Plan Formats  

The format and style of a lesson plan depends on several  factors. Certainly the subject matter has a lot to do with  how a lesson is presented and what teaching method is used.  Individual lesson plans may be quite simple for one-on-one  training, or they may be elaborate and complicated for large,  structured classroom lessons. Preferably, each lesson should  have somewhat limited objectives that are achievable within  a reasonable period of time. This principle should apply to  both ground and flight training. As previously noted, aviation  training is not simple.  

# The Gas Balloon  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses topics relating specifically to manned  gas ballooning. The understanding and flying of gas balloons is  very similar to hot air ballooning, but there are also significant  differences. This chapter generally discusses the differences  and assumes that the reader is familiar with the topics in the  other chapters of this handbook. Frequent comparisons to  hot air ballooning are used to place discussions in a more  familiar context for the hot air balloon pilot.  

Much of this chapter relates to gas balloons with an envelope  volume of 1,000 cubic meters (35,315 cubic feet). This is  by far the most common size and is the maximum volume  allowed for the major competitions. Several types of lifting  gas are discussed, but the main emphasis is on helium and  hydrogen. All discussions assume that the envelope is the  “zero pressure” type. Zero pressure envelopes have an open  appendix, or tube, at the bottom that maintains a zero pressure  difference between the gas inside the envelope and the  atmospheric air outside. Neither super-pressure balloons nor  Rozière (a type of gas-hot air hybrid construction) balloons  are discussed.  

Gas ballooning was once the most common form of aviation  in the United States. Today, due to the costs involved,  gas flights are most frequently undertaken for training,  competition, or record breaking purposes. Short, recreational  gas flights, while not unheard of, are much less common  than hot air.  

# The History of Gas Ballooning  

The first gas balloon flight occurred just a few weeks after the  first manned balloon flight of Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier  and the Marquis d’Arlandes. While the Montgolfiers were  experimenting with hot air balloons, the Robert brothers and  Jacques Charles were also experimenting with gas balloons.  

The first gas balloon was small (13 feet in diameter) and was  filled with what was called “inflammable air.”  [Figure 11-1] It generated 35 pounds of net lift and, when set free, remained  aloft for 45 minutes and traveled 15 miles. Its final, sudden  descent was attributed to a rupture in the balloon.  

![](images/60bc3c2ef81dbeeeef8890892fb1530cf8733cd06ea30080582dc6059359cceb.jpg)  
Figure 11-1.   Early style of gas balloon. Many of these terms still  apply today.  

With the success of the demonstration flight, Charles next  made a 25.5-foot diameter globe of rubberized silk. A net  was fitted over the upper half of the balloon and tied to a  loop around the middle of the bag. From this loop, a sort of  car or boat was suspended. The bag was tied at the bottom  to contain the gas. Dropping ballast caused the balloon to  rise, and releasing gas through a valve at the top made it  fall. On December 1, 1783, Professor Charles and Nicholas  Robert made the first manned gas balloon flight. The first  flight lasted for 1 hour and 45 minutes, rose to 1,800 feet, and  covered more than 27 miles. On landing, Robert got out of the  boat and Charles, now flying solo, ascended to almost 9,000  feet. The balloon had been flaccid on first landing, but filled  out as it rose and gas was released to prevent it from bursting.  Benjamin Franklin was present for this lift off and recognized  the potential for balloons in military operations.  

Other ascensions followed, mostly to gather scientific data.  It was through these early experiments that the design/shape  of gas balloons, lifting capacity, and weight of air were  determined. One notable early flight was the crossing of  the English Channel from Britain to France by Jean-Pierre  Blanchard and Dr. John Jeffries on January 7, 1785. Their  balloon was scarcely sufficient to carry them and they threw  out their ballast, anchors, food, and clothing to complete the  crossing.  

In 1906, James Gordon Bennett needed news for his  newspaper and having been successful in starting car and  boat races, decided to initiate a gas balloon race. The first  race was organized for Paris, France. Each country could send  contestants to the race. This race, the Coupe Aéronautique  de Gordon Bennett, is still held annually although there were  years when no race occurred due to wars. Today, the race is  the most prestigious gas race in the world. It is sanctioned  by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). The  country of the previous year’s winner is entitled to host the  race. In 2006, the  $50^{\mathrm{th}}$   race was held flying out of Belgium  (www.coupegordonbennett.org).  

The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta (AIBF) started  the America’s Challenge Gas Balloon Race in 1995. It has  been conducted yearly, with the exception of 1999 when  AIBF instead hosted the Gordon Bennett Race. This has  become a very prestigious and international race that offers  pilots the opportunity for extremely long flights (www. balloonfiesta.com/Education/History/).  

# Balloon Systems  

Gas balloons designs are generally classified as netted or  quick fill.  

# Netted Balloon Systems  

The netted design  [Figure 11-2]  dates from the  $18^{\mathrm{th}}$   century.  A spherical balloon envelope is encased in a diamond mesh  net of light weight cord that runs around the balloon from  the apex valve at the top of the envelope down to support  points on the gondola.  

Inflation is accomplished by first bringing the inflation  hose to the center of a ground tarp. The envelope is next  laid over the hose with the hose inserted into the appendix  and with the apex of the balloon on top and centered. The  net is deployed over and attached to the envelope and as the  lifting gas is flowed, sandbags are hung on the diamonds of  the net at ground level. As the balloon fills and forms a rising  hemisphere, the crew moves the sandbags down the net to  keep them at ground level. Enough bags are added to keep  the balloon anchored to the ground.  

After the envelope is completely filled, it is raised and the  basket is brought underneath and attached to the net. The  hemispherical shape is very stable in moderate to high ground  winds as the flow is over the top of the shape. One drawback  of netted balloons is that more crew is required to manage  the sandbags during inflation.  

# Quick Fill Balloon Systems  

The quick fill design dates from the mid 20th century. A  natural shape envelope is surrounded by vertical support  tapes that run from the apex of the balloon down to the  gondola.  [Figure 11-3]  Several horizontal tapes extend  c irc um fe rent i ally around and are attached to the vertical tapes  to stabilize the structure.  

Inflation is accomplished by laying out the envelope on the  ground along its full length with the apex at one end and the  appendix (base) at the other. The gondola is attached to the  load lines and is bagged down. As the lifting gas is flowed  in through the appendix, several crew members hold the  apex of the balloon down. When enough gas has entered  the envelope to generate approximately 100 to 150 pounds  of net lift, the apex is released, the envelope rises, and the  inflation is completed.  

# Lifting Gases  

Modern gas balloons normally use helium or hydrogen as  the lifting gas. Anhydrous ammonia and methane are two  other less common options. Helium is a monotomic, inert  gas and must be refined to reach a purity of greater than  99 percent from raw well gas at a purity of a few percent.  Hydrogen typically exists in the molecular form   $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  . It is  flammable when combined in a mixture of 25 percent   $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  to 75 percent air. This means that this mixture supports an  existing flame.  

![](images/814ba56c95e35e7e1d4b9c0de4e8ec336c7b3b490341a7f651044975e47729e3.jpg)

Figure 11-3.   Quick fill design gas balloon.  

Helium is expensive but is more commonly used in the  United States while hydrogen is more common in Europe.  Helium provides slightly less lift than hydrogen but is the  more stable gas. (See subsection titled Flying in Inversions  on page 11-7 for a discussion of stability.) Balloon systems  must not be prone to generating static electricity if they are  to be used with hydrogen.  

There are at least six factors to consider when choosing a  lifting gas. These are:  

1.  Compatibility with the balloon system being used  2.  Cost  3.  Lifting capacity 4.  Availability  5.  Locale of flight  6.  Inherent gas stability  

Normally, the gas selection process starts with the type  of balloon. Hydrogen can be used if the balloon system  is hydrogen compatible, hydrogen is available, and local  ordinances allow its use. If one of these conditions is not  satisfied, as is often the case in the United States, then helium  is the likely choice. If a very short training or pleasure flight  of several hours is planned, the more economical alternative  of ammonia or methane (natural gas) may be considered.  

When inflating or landing with hydrogen or methane, care  must be taken to ensure that no flame or material with the  potential to generate sparks is present in the launch locale.  Lighted cigarettes, cigars, nylon clothing, cell phones, and  other electronic devices are examples of forbidden items.  Only essential personnel should be allowed in the launch and  landing areas. For long, competitive flights, the increased  stability of helium is a factor in its favor.  

# Components of the Gas Balloon  

Gas balloon systems can be broken into four parts:  

1.  Envelope to contain the lifting gas 2.  Gondola for carrying pilots and equipment 3.  Support system to connect the envelope to the  gondola 4.  Other equipment  

# Envelope  

The maneuvering valve  [Figure 11-4]  is at the apex of the  envelope. It allows for the controlled release of a small  amount of gas to initiate a descent. It is usually spring  actuated and controlled via a line that runs from the valve  down through the envelope into the gondola. On some  

![](images/adc0727dbb26b9d3c57b12ab8e9c98d1937ee19fdf3218ba606dda2d10db8d90.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.   Maneuvering valve on quick fill gas ballon.  

balloons, a gas tight parachute top may be used instead of a  valve. The envelope is also equipped with either a rip panel  or deflation port for rapid, total deflation during high wind  landings. More information on proper use of the valve and  deflation ports is provided in the section The Practice of Gas  Ballooning, page 11-8.  

# Gondola  

The gas balloon’s gondola  [Figure 11-5]  is typically  somewhat larger than ones used for sport hot air ballooning,  with four by five feet being a typical size. A foldable cot or  sleeping pad normally runs along the long side of the gondola  and a “kick-out” panel in the side wall at one end of the cot  may be used to provide additional legroom for sleeping.  

![](images/97390f90765997141ffb87056947663c30fd27ec7cdbc4a0e56cf69a71141383.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.   Typical gondola layout.  

A trail rope is slung on the outside gondola along with much  of the remaining support equipment. The trail rope is typically  about 150 feet of natural fiber rope, one inch in diameter and  weighs about 40 pounds. Its use is described in the landing  paragraph.  

# Support Cabling  

The connection between envelope and gondola may be made  of rope, flat tape, or steel cable. The total strength of the  cabling should have a breaking strength of at least five times  the maximum gross load that is suspended on the cables.  This must include sand ballast, as well as the weight of the  gondola, the occupants, and all supplies and equipment. For hydrogen systems, the cabling must be electrically  conductive. For ammonia systems, the cables should be long  enough to separate the occupants of the gondola from gas  fumes coming out of the appendix.  

The bottom end of the cabling is gathered at a load ring which  acts as the interface between the envelope and the gondola  cables. The load ring also serves as the system’s strong point  for attachment of inflation harnesses or trail ropes.  

# Equipment  

Equipment carried varies with the purpose of the flight.  A minimum equipment list should include an altimeter/ variometer, compass, global positioning system (GPS),  aircraft position lights, several flashlights (for night flights),  oxygen (for high altitude flights), aircraft radio, and  aircraft sectional maps for navigation and communication.  [Figure 11-6]  Other items which may be included for safety  and occupant comfort may include: a first aid kit, adequate  food, water, warm clothing, and toilet facilities for both  the planned flight and for the postflight period before the  recovery crew arrives.  

![](images/3002d7e4e88cbea617918dfffe7a2912ef19f42990c390a6b83a6acf64cf550a.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.   Instruments and radios are sometimes carried in a  pod such as this.  

# Theory of Gas Ballooning  

Complete books have been written on the theory of gas  ballooning and a full discussion of the topic is not possible  here. At the very least, three topics must be understood by  the competent gas pilot: physics, weather aspects, and the  significance of different lifting gases.  

# Physics of Gas Ballooning  

Four main factors are instrumental in determining lift:  

1.  Type of lifting gas used (e.g., helium, hydrogen, or  anhydrous ammonia) 2.  Amount of lifting gas in the envelope (usually equal  to the envelope’s total capacity) 3.  Outside air temperature 4.  Ambient barometric pressure (which is directly related  to altitude and local weather conditions).  

# Lift at Sea Level  

The generation of buoyancy (commonly referred to as “lift”)  in a gas balloon is somewhat different from that of a hot air  balloon. The basic principle is the same, but for different  reasons.  

One cubic meter of air weighs 2.702 pounds at sea level  under International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) conditions 

 (29.92 inches of mercury   $("\mathrm{Hg})$   and 59 degrees Fahrenheit 

  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   at sea level). At the same time, and also under ISA  conditions, a cubic meter of helium weighs 0.3729 pounds.  The difference between these two numbers, 2.329 pounds,  is the gross lift of a gas balloon with a volume of one cubic  meter. T o determine the gross lift under ISA conditions, it then  becomes a simple multiplication of 2.329 pounds times the  volume of the envelope. For the standard 1,000 cubic meter  gas balloon, the gross lift is 2,329 pounds.  

The above calculation is valid for helium. If, however,  hydrogen is used as the lifting gas, the factor is 0.189 pounds  per cubic meter; anhydrous ammonia’s weight is 1.583  pounds per cubic meter. As compared to helium, hydrogen  has 8 percent more gross lift per cubic meter, while ammonia  has approximately 50 percent less lift than helium under ISA  conditions.  

# Lift at Altitude  

As a balloon ascends, it is generally true that temperature,  atmospheric pressure, and gross lift all decrease. Gross lift  decreases as pressure decreases, but increases as temperature  decreases. Thus, as a gas balloon rises in the atmosphere, the  decreasing pressure and temperature oppose each other. The  decreasing temperature increases lift while the decreasing  pressure decreases lift. Atmospheric pressure changes are  more significant than temperature changes. Thus, net lift  decreases as altitude increases in a standard atmosphere.  

When calculating the effect of changing pressure and  temperature, it is necessary to multiply the sea level lift by  the ratio of pressures and temperatures. For a nonstandard  ambient pressure, multiply the lift at the ISA level either by   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   or 1,013.25 millibars (mb).  

Temperatures at altitude must also be calculated and  compensated for. The factor for temperature is a ratio of  absolute temperatures expressed in either degrees Kelvin  or Rankine. To get temperature in degrees Rankine, simply  add 459 to the normal Fahrenheit temperature. For a new  temperature, multiply the lift calculated at the ISA by the  factor:   $(59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}+459)$  /(new temperature  $+\;459$  ). When using  temperature in degrees Centigrade   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  , add 273 to convert  to absolute temperature (i.e., Kelvin). This is:   $^{15}\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}+$  273)/(new temperature  $+\,273$  ). Various lift factors at differing  altitudes, comparing helium and hydrogen, are illustrated in  Appendix F.  

# Pressure Ceiling  

The pressure ceiling is the altitude at which the lifting gas  inside the envelope would expand to just completely fill the  envelope, assuming the balloon rose to that altitude. Rising  above the pressure ceiling causes lifting gas to be expelled  from the appendix and establishes a new, higher pressure  ceiling. Exceeding the current pressure ceiling causes loss of  lifting gas, reduces gross lift, and typically causes the balloon  to eventually begin to descend. Ballast must be expended to  maintain the new higher altitude. However, maneuvers that  result in altitude changes below the pressure ceiling, do not  result in loss of lifting gas or gross lift. Very little ballast is  required to ascend while below the pressure ceiling. For these  reasons, the gas pilot should always be aware of what the  approximate current pressure ceiling is and should consider  the consequences of penetrating that ceiling.  

The following approximations generally apply to a balloon  below 18,000 mean seal level (MSL).  

1.  For a 1,000 cubic meter balloon at its pressure ceiling,  an ambient pressure decrease of   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   causes a  decrease in gross lift of about 80 pounds. 2.  For a 1,000 cubic meter balloon at its pressure ceiling,  an ambient and gas temperature decrease of   $3.3\ ^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{F}$  causes a lift increase of about 16 pounds. 3.   For a 1,000 cubic meter balloon at its pressure ceiling,  a discharge of about 64 pounds of ballast results in  approximately a 1,000 foot increase in altitude.  

# Additional Factors That Affect Lift  

1.  A balloon flying below its pressure ceiling (i.e., a  flaccid balloon) responds differently from one flying  at its pressure ceiling.  

2.  When the lifting gas inside the balloon is warmer (i.e.,  super heating) than the ambient air, additional lift is  generated. The reverse happens when the lifting gas  is colder than the ambient air. 3.  Nonstandard atmospheric conditions, such as  inversions, affect a balloon’s stability. 4.  The atmospheric humidity has a small effect on lift  with more humidity resulting in slightly less lift. 5.  The purity of the lifting gas directly affects lift. Most  commercially produced gas is assumed to be greater  than 99 percent pure, but purity can be reduced as a  result of improper filling technique.  

For further discussion of gas balloon calculations, the book  A Short Course on the Theory and Operation of the Free  Balloon , by C. H. Roth, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company,  is recommended reading. This manual provides a good  overview of the physics and operation of gas ballooning as  of 1917. It is long out of print, but photocopies are readily  available.  

# Weather Considerations for Gas  Ballooning  

When studying weather for gas ballooning, one must look  for trends both further into the future and higher above  the ground. The best weather for any flight is determined  by the flight’s objectives. A flight to set a duration record  (maximum time aloft) benefits from light winds and clear  skies while a distance competition requires high winds aloft  with lighter winds in the landing zone. A competitor in a  long competition is likely to encounter several different  weather patterns during flight simply due to the length of  the flight. Examples of these include precipitation, snow,  icing, thunderstorms, lightning, high winds, mountain winds,  unstable air, or convective currents.  

This discussion again focuses on the most common type of  competitive flight, a Gordon Bennett type, with the objective  to maximize great circle distance covered. Since winning  distances can be well over a thousand miles at altitudes of  up to 18,000 feet MSL with times aloft possibly exceeding  seventy hours, a much larger area of the weather map must  be studied than for a typical hot air flight.  

# Meteorological Differences From Hot Air  Ballooning  

In contrast to hot air flights, landing conditions are most  likely to be different from those at launch and several weather  patterns may be encountered during the flight. Freezing  levels and the moisture content of the air should be checked  to predict the possibility of icing. Any icing that occurs has  multiple negative impacts on the flight. It adds weight to  the balloon and can interfere with the functioning of the  valve by preventing it from either opening properly or from  sealing tightly after activation.  The weight of the ice should  initiate a natural descent to a lower altitude and warmer  temperatures. If this does not happen naturally, the pilot may  initiate a descent by valving. Be aware that the melting ice  at lower altitudes lightens the system and additional valving  is necessary to prevent a second ascend back above the  freezing level. Falling ice shards have also been blamed for  equipment damage on occasional flights. A second strategy  against icing is to seek drier air above the saturated air but the  higher altitude is unlikely to provide the warmer temperatures  needed to melt the accumulated ice.  

Encountering thunderstorm activity is much more common  in gas versus hot air flights. This is especially dangerous  when flying an explosive gas such as hydrogen. Isolated  thunderstorms can develop due to solar heating of moist air  in the afternoon over the great plains of the United States  with very little warning. Prediction and avoidance are the  best tools against thunderstorms. Real time contact between  the pilots and a ground-based meteorologist with access to  forecasting tools to predict the formation of thunderstorms  can help to avoid these storms. During the different stages  of a thunderstorm, rapid accelerations due to inflows or  outflows, as well as rapid ascents or descents, are very likely.  The presence of any of these effects, in conjunction with  any thunder or lightning are indications that an immediate  landing is prudent.  

# Meteorological Flight Planning  

Flight planning for a gas balloon flight starts several days  prior to the planned flight. The gas balloon pilot examines  numerous meteorological tools, looking at frontal movement  to get the big picture, wind speed and direction forecasts at  several altitudes, and future times to predict a flight path.  Then, they will study forecast precipitation probabilities  and freezing levels over the flight period. Modern trajectory  predictors, such as the HYSPLIT (www.arl.noaa.gov/ ready.html) program, maintained by National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) can be a great  help. However, the HYSPLIT model gives no forecast for  precipitation along the route, so the possibility of rain, snow,  or icing must be assessed using other weather models. Often,  ideal weather is found just after a frontal passage, after any  moisture has cleared but while the air mass is still moving  with the departing front.  

For serious competitions, a professional meteorologist is an  invaluable team member and is consulted before and during  the flight. A good starting point for weather investigations  is NOAA ’s aviation weather web site www.aviationweather. gov.  

# Flying in Inversions  

Proper utilization of atmospheric temperature inversions  during gas balloon flights can result in increased flight  stability and ballast conservation.  Figure 11-7  shows a  simplified atmospheric temperature lapse chart when no  inversion is present.  Figure 11-8  is similar but with an  inversion present. In both charts, altitude increases up the  vertical scale and temperature increases going to the right  on the horizontal scale.  Figure 11-7  shows temperature  decreasing consistently with altitude, while  Figure 11-8  has  an inversion zone (inside red circle) from 2,000 to 4,000 feet  

![](images/68bd95379bbb3329717d3fe8e586626b3c844c3ddeaa8a33e18b9255256bcee7.jpg)

Figure 11-8.   Atmosphere exhibiting an inversion.  

in which the temperature increases with increasing altitude.  A gas balloon flying in this inversion has the advantage of  increased stability as compared to the altitudes above or  below the inversion which exhibit normal lapse rates.  

To explain this, it is important to understand the term  “stability” with respect to a gas balloon. Stability can be  imagined as an invisible hand that gently pulls the balloon  down whenever it starts to rise or alternately pushes the  balloon back up as it starts to fall. A balloon flying in stable  weather tends to fly level with very little intervention from  the pilot. However, stability is a weak condition and can  be overcome by many factors, such as gain or loss of solar  heating, orographic winds, and ballasting or valving.  

To understand why an inversion creates stable flying  conditions, think of a gas balloon flying at 3,000 feet in the  middle of the inversion. If, for some reason, the balloon  starts to ascend, two things happen. First, the balloon enters  warmer ambient air. Second, the lifting gas inside the balloon  expands and cools adiabatically as it reaches the slightly  lower pressure atmosphere of the higher altitude. Both of  these effects cause the balloon to lose lift and to descend. It is  helpful to remember that, as a hot air balloon either cools or  enters hotter air, the temperature differential between outside  and inside air decreases and lift is lost. The same principle  applies here, as applied to gas balloons. Subsequently, if the  gas balloon descends from its starting point, it encounters  cooler outside ambient air and its interior gas compresses and  warms adiabatically, therefore gaining and ascending back to  its original altitude. Remember, in an inversion, either motion  (ascending or descending) tends to cause an opposing force  to passively initiate a return to the original altitude.  

With proper planning, the gas balloon pilot can take advantage  of this scenario. Weather theory teaches that inversions often  set up at night either right at the surface (sometimes referred  to as “surface inversion”) or at some altitude above the ground  (generally referred to as an “inversion aloft”) as shown in  Figure 11-8 . Visible signs of an inversion may be pollution  trapped below the inversion causing reduced visibility and  dirty looking air. Invisible signs of an inversion may be  significantly more stable flying conditions in the inversion  area. If a slow, steady initial ascent is initiated (best done  by launching with a flaccid balloon), the balloon may find  an inversion with no help from the pilot by leveling off as it  enters the inversion zone. More likely the pilot has to hunt  for the inversion; inversion levels can be determined from the  use of the Skew-T charts as previously discussed in Chapter  4, Weather Theory and Reports.  

level. If a pilot suspects an inversion aloft may exist above,  he or she can initiate a slow ascent. If the envelope is flaccid  and the ambient air at this altitude is not inverted, then the  balloon tends to continue rising until it either encounters an  inversion or becomes full as it reaches its pressure ceiling. If  the balloon levels out while it is still flaccid, this may indicate  that it has entered an inversion zone. If the balloon continues  to fly level passively, it is flying in an inversion.  

# The Practice of Gas Ballooning  

# Gas Balloon Regulations  

For a pilot with a hot air rating, certification to fly gas  balloons requires the removal of the “with airborne heater”  limitation on his or her certificate. For a private pilot gas  rating, aeronautical experience requirements in Title 14 of  the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) section 61.109(h)  (1) require “…at least two flights of at least 2 hours each  that consists of  

(i) At least one training flight with an authorized  instructor within 60 days prior to application for the  rating on the areas of operation for a gas balloon; (ii) At least one flight performing the duties of pilot  in command in a gas balloon with an authorized  instructor; and (iii) At least one flight involving a controlled ascent to  3,000 feet above the launch site. ”  

The regulation for removal of the airborne heater restriction  from an existing hot air pilot’s certificate (14 CFR Section  61.115 Balloon ratings: Limitations) states:  

(2)  The limitation may be removed when the person  obtains the required aeronautical experience in a  gas balloon and receives a logbook endorsement  from an authorized instructor who attests to the  person’s accomplishment of the required aeronautical  experience and ability to satisfactorily operate a gas  balloon.  

NOTE: Only a logbook entry is required to complete the  process (no check ride), since the gas authorization is a  removal of a restriction from an existing rating rather than  an issuance of a new rating.  

The regulations for the aeronautical experience for a  commercial rating are virtually identical according to 14  CFR section 61.129(h)(4)(i) except that the student must act  as pilot in command on both flights and the controlled ascent  must be to “…5,000 feet above the launch site.”  

As an example, during flight at night very near the ground,  a pilot may feel he or she is continually ballasting to fly  Additional areas of specific interest to gas balloon pilots are  the regulation for currency for night flight according to 14  CFR section 61.57(b)(1):  

“…no person may act as pilot in command of an aircraft  carrying passengers during the period beginning 1 hour after  sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise unless within the  preceding 90 days that person has made at least three takeoffs  and three landings to a full stop during the period beginning  1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise.”  

NOTE: This is similar to the currency for day flight and only  applies to flights with passengers. It does not prohibit night  flight when only pilots are on board.  

Also of interest are the sections on aircraft lights (14 CFR  section 91.209) for night flight; the use of supplemental  oxygen (14 CFR section 91.211), and the use of transponders  (14 CFR section 91.215).  

# Flight Planning  

During the planning stage of the flight, the objectives of the  flight should be established. Possibilities include: training,  pleasure, competition, record setting, new equipment  checkout, or possibly scientific investigation. Then, the  expected flight parameters should be developed. These  include the number of pilots and passengers, balloon  parameters (type, size, and lifting gas to be used), launch  time and location, expected duration, required weather,  maximum altitude, and predicted landing zone. If a fixed  date has been selected for the flight, an initial meteorological  assessment should be made approximately three days out  and subsequent weather developments are used to make a  “go/no-go” decision. If the flight date is flexible over an  extended time window, continual monitoring of the weather  is required until proper conditions develop.  

After this, an equipment list can be developed and a  system weight and ballast calculation should be performed.  Permission to use the desired launch site must be confirmed  and the availability of adequate gas supply and launch and  chase crew must be assured. A concise schedule should be  sent to all crew members, defining when decisions are made  and how these decisions are communicated to the crew.  

Finally, all inflation and flight equipment must be assembled  and checked out for proper functioning. The chase vehicle  selected should be able cover the expected distance and bring  all participants back home.  

# Layout and Inﬂation  

When the day comes, all equipment is transported to the  launch site. A site “walk-around” is performed to remove  debris and trash and to check for obstructions to inflation  or takeoff. Layout and assembly differ by balloon type, but  should proceed according to the balloon’s flight manual. For  quick fill balloons, layout should be downwind, similar to  hot air balloons. A crew briefing should be performed and a  crew chief should be designated. Safety must be emphasized;  new crew members must be given specific instructions and be  assigned to a more experienced crew member for guidance.  Gas balloon launches still tend to draw a crowd and some  form of crowd control may be required.  [Figure 11-9]  

![](images/ee1894979c33dfd57a8efb823085d70e0b2b2288fe3831f66acc891b17035dcf.jpg)  
Figure 11-9.   America’s Challenge launch at Fiesta Park,  Albuquerque, New Mexico.  

A launch restraint should be secured and additional inflation  ballast (weighing several hundred pounds more than the  pilots and supplies that eventually are on board) should be  added to the gondola.  

The start of gas flow is a critical point in the inflation. A  slow initial flow allows a last minute check of cable routings  and crew positions. Surface weather conditions determine  flow rate after the initial checkout. For quick fill systems, a  partially filled envelope is much more subject to twisting in  wind gusts. A flaccid envelope tends to present a concave  (spoon-shaped) surface to the wind, producing a higher drag  factor and placing more stress on the entire system.  Once  the envelope’s shape has filled out to a convex (beach ball)  shape, it is more able to stand by shedding wind gusts around  it. Quick fill systems are much more subject to this effect  than are netted balloons.  

As described in the section on balloon systems, a netted  balloon envelope is laid out flat on the ground and its shape  during inflation resembles a sphere rising out of the ground.  It always presents a convex (shedding) shape to the wind. A  separate step is required after inflation to install the basket  and attach it to the load lines coming down from the net.  

A good rule of thumb is to take no more time than is  necessary to complete the fill. This is especially true in  windy conditions.  

# Launch  

With the use of a checklist, confirm that all required  equipment items and pilots are on board. A launch master is  usually assigned to direct removal of excess inflation ballast  until the system is neutrally buoyant. Desired ascent rate  determines how much additional ballast is removed to attain  the proper amount of positive buoyancy. The launch master  should be an experienced gas balloonist and direct crew to  allow the balloon to rise several feet off the ground several  times to test the buoyancy before instructing the crew to bring  it back to the ground one last time before final release. If the  ascent rate is too slow, additional ballast are removed until  the proper rate is achieved. After a final check for airspace  clearance above, the “Hands off!” command is given and the  balloon is allowed to fly free.  [Figure 11-10]  

![](images/464609012ca22c7d025a34fbe44caca2c23353090ede326e2a5166ec27056cfc.jpg)  
Figure 11-10.   A gas balloon, shortly after the weigh off procedure,  ascends into the sky.  

# Inﬂight Procedures  

All other things being equal, a gas balloon’s natural tendency  is to find its equilibrium altitude and to fly level at that  altitude. By contrast, a hot air balloon’s natural tendency to  descend must be counteracted with periodic infusions of heat.  In a gas balloon, pilot action is only required to initiate or  arrest an ascent or descent or to counter atmospheric or other  disturbances. A gas balloon may fly for an hour or longer with  no intervention by the pilot. Pilot initiated altitude changes  with gas balloons tend to occur at a slower rate over a longer  time period as compared to hot air ballooning.  

Ascents are initiated by jettisoning ballast (usually sand or  water) while descents result from releasing lifting gas from  a valve at the top of the envelope.  

Significant midflight altitude changes are often undertaken  as part of a long-term strategic plan rather than for short  term tactical reasons. The consequences of any maneuver  should be considered carefully before being undertaken. It is  often stated that ballast is the fuel of a gas balloon and well  before all ballast has been expended, the aircraft must be  safely back on the ground. Use of large amounts of ballast  to execute a major ascent invariably shortens the potential  duration of a flight.  

For example, in a distance competition, an ascent from the  surface to 12,000 feet MSL may be executed to enter more  favorable winds. This may take 1 hour to accomplish but  that altitude may then be maintained for the next 8 hours if  weather conditions are stable.  

Two additional concepts that must be understood to pilot gas  balloons are solar heating and lifting gas purity.  

# Solar Heating  

Solar heating (also called super-heating) occurs when the  heat of the sun is trapped inside the balloon’s envelope  and causes the temperature of the lifting gas to exceed the  outside air temperature. As the heated lifting gas expands,  one of two things will happen. If the envelope is flaccid, the  less dense gas occupies a larger fraction of the envelope’s  volume and displaces more air and the system’s gross  lift temporarily increases. This causes the balloon to rise  towards its pressure ceiling and it also temporarily causes  the pressure ceiling to drop. When the envelope becomes full  (i.e., reaches its pressure ceiling), gas is expelled and a new  ceiling is established.  

If the flight is continued through sunset, loss of solar heating  results in a cooling of the lifting gas and a resultant loss of  gross lift. Ballast must then be used to maintain buoyancy.  

# Purity of Lifting Gas  

A final topic of interest is the effect of mixing air with the  lifting gas. It may seem that since air is heavier than the lifting  gas, the air would have a tendency to pool at the bottom of  the envelope and be expelled through the appendix as the  balloon rises into less dense air. However, this is not what  happens. The forces of molecular attractions cause the air  and lifting gas to become permanently mixed and a generally  less pure mixture occurs. When this happens, some of the  benefits of operating under the pressure ceiling are lost and  every up/down maneuver causes the loss of lifting gas along  with the expelled air.  

For this reason, care should be taken to close the appendix  when descending rapidly to avoid allowing air to force its way  up into the envelope through the open appendix. Maintaining  a high level of purity of the gas inside the envelope can extend  flight duration. Care must be taken to open the appendix  during rapid or prolonged ascents which bring the balloon  close to its pressure ceiling. Ascent above pressure ceiling  with a closed appendix increases internal pressure on the  envelope’s fabric and, in an extreme case, could cause the  envelope to rupture.  

# Landing, Retrieval and Packup  

The landing phase is the single most critical portion of the  entire flight. The pilots may be fatigued from the long flight.  They may be in unfamiliar geography and weather conditions.  There may be time pressure to land in daylight if sunset is  approaching. A landing after dark, under a full moon and  in open territory may be performed rather routinely, but a  daylight landing is still much preferred. A night time landing  in dense woods under a new moon or with reduced visibility  can be very stressful. Five minutes on oxygen prior to landing  may help to relieve some fatigue and clear the senses.  

The landing decision varies with each flight and should be  discussed jointly among all the pilots. Landings should be  initiated while there is still adequate ballast available to  abort at least one approach, if necessary. The actual amount  of ballast required varies with pilot experience, weather  conditions, terrain and descent rate. For a 1,000 cubic meter  balloon in relatively easy landing conditions and under  a shallow descent, 50 pounds may suffice. Under more  adverse conditions, 250 pounds or more may be advisable.  Additional considerations for landing may include duration  of flight, fatigue level of the pilots, accomplishment of the  flight objectives, current and forecast weather, terrain, and  time of day.  

When the decision is made to land, all possible equipment  should be securely stowed. Occupants should don helmets  and any other protective gear. All antennas, solar panels, and  other items hanging below the basket should be retrieved  and stowed. Adequate ballast should be brought inside the  basket where it is readily available to abort or round-out a  landing.  

The trail rope should be rigged and readied for deployment.  The trail rope serves three purposes. First, it slows the descent  rate. A fully deployed trail rope weighing about 40 pounds  on a 1,000 cubic meter balloon normally arrests a descent of  approximately 340 feet per minute (fpm) at 150 feet above  ground level (AGL) to a descent rate of 0 fpm at ground  contact. The descent from 150 feet will take about 45 seconds.  These numbers are only approximations and local conditions  at landing certainly cause these to vary somewhat. Secondly,  the trail rope orients the balloon so the attachment point of  the rope is on the upwind (or trailing) side of the basket. This  may be important depending on the arrangement of the basket  and/or deflation ports. Finally, as more of the rope contacts  the ground, friction slows the horizontal speed of the balloon.  The trail rope should be connected to the load ring with a  quick release mechanism to allow release should the trail rope  become permanently entangled on the ground.  

If the gondola has rotated during flight, placing the trail rope  on the gondola’s downwind side, it does not deploy correctly  unless the pilot guides it around to the upwind side of the  gondola. Otherwise the rope deploys under the gondola and  tends to pull the leading edge of the gondola down and may  completely invert it. This is colloquially called “dog-housing”  and puts the occupants in the uncomfortable position of  being dragged along the ground trapped inside the basket.  Unlike modern hot air balloons, most gas balloon systems  do not have rigid uprights, so dog-housing is a real concern  in a high wind landing; the best antidote is to keep as much  weight as possible (including the occupants) on the upwind  (trailing) side of the basket.  

The trail rope also acts to stop any ascent since a rising  balloon becomes heavier as more of the rope is lifted off the  ground. This is why it is sometimes called “retrievable” or  “reusable” ballast. For this reason, the trail rope should never  be deployed until landing is completely certain. Aborting  a landing with a deployed trail rope requires ballasting  the weight of the trail rope (approximately forty pounds)  in addition to the ballast normally required to achieve the  desired ascent rate.  

The anti-sail line should be pulled tight and secured to the  load ring or other strong point. The purpose of this line is  to hold the bottom of the envelope down taut to minimize  drag in a high wind landing. If the envelope is allowed to  ride free, it rides up and bows in the wind, forming a scoop  that catches much more wind and increases the length of the  drag along the ground.  

At this point, the descent is initiated and one or more potential  landing sites should be identified. If the descent continues  as expected and an adequate landing site is attainable, the  descent rate should be tailored toward that site.  A last check  should be made for powerlines and other obstructions on  the path to the landing site. The area downwind of the site  should also be checked in case landing runs long. Only then,  at a height above ground equal to the length of the trail rope  (usually about 150 feet), and only if there are no intervening  obstacles between the balloon and the landing site, will the  trail rope be deployed.  [Figure 11-11]

Figure 11-11.   A successful gas balloon landing.  

As with a hot air balloon, if a fast layer has been encountered  during the descent, it may be advisable to level off at an  altitude below the fast layer to burn off some momentum.  However, if this jeopardizes hitting the only likely landing  site, a high wind landing is the better option.  

The final phase of the landing is ground contact, and just  as in piloting a hot air balloon, a decision must be made to  perform either a rip-out or standup landing. Contrary to hot  air ballooning, in gas, rip-out landings are the norm. Up to  the final moment, ascent rate is controlled by actuating the  valve (or parachute) to release small amounts of lifting gas.  As in hot air ballooning, both pilots should be positioned  for landing. Typically at about five feet AGL, the deflation  port line (usually red) is pulled to open the port and release  a large quantity of gas immediately. Some systems may  have multiple deflation ports. Once the deflation port is  activated, the flight is terminated with a rapid descent, so it  is important to be close to the ground before activation. The  height of activation can occasionally be as high as thirty to  fifty feet in for emergency reasons, but a very hard landing  is sure to ensue.  

On the newer German (Wörner) balloons with sealing  parachute tops, it is possible to reseat the parachute after  a deep activation of several seconds, but gas equivalent to  many bags of ballast has been lost.  Shorter, shallower vents  are used on these systems for maneuvering, but deflation is  achieved with a deep constant pull on the parachute line.  

Once the balloon has come to a stop and is no longer buoyant,  the pilots exit and attempt to contact the chase. Any medical  concerns should be dealt with immediately. Landowners  should be located, if possible, and an inventory of the contents  of the gondola should be done to check to see if anything  bounced out during the landing. If darkness is near and no  houses are in sight, flashlights, a compass, and GPS should  be located immediately to ensure that bearings are not lost  in the dark. On a long flight, it may be several hours until  the chase crew arrives, but when they do, pack-up proceeds  in reverse of assembly.  

# The America’s Challenge Race, 2006  

The 2006 America’s Challenge gas balloon competition is  considered by many in the gas balloon community to be  one of the most exciting and controversial flights in recent  years. It is presented here as an illustration of the skills and  decision-making processes necessary for a successful gas  balloon flight.  

In July 2006, two gas balloon pilots from Georgia, Andy  Cayton and Danni Suskin, were to participate in the Gordon  Bennett challenge competition in Belgium. Upon preparation  for launch, it was discovered that the balloon to be used had  some mechanical problems that kept the Cayton-Suskin team  from flying. Cayton came back to the United States with every  intention of winning the America’s Challenge in the hope of  having the opportunity to pursue a victory in the following  year’s Gordon Bennett. As Suskin was unable to participate  in the event, Cayton selected Kevin Knapp of North Carolina  as his co-pilot for the America’s Challenge.  

Launch was originally scheduled for the evening of October  7, 2006. Don Day, a meteorologist who worked with Cayton  on numerous world record hot air flights as well as other  gas flights, was located at the launch field in Albuquerque,  New Mexico. In conference with Cayton and Knapp, Day  determined that the weather would be a significant factor  in the launch and in any subsequent flight track across the  United States. The initial track for the planned launch date  would have put the team on a northeasterly track towards  Canada; but, low freezing levels and thunderstorms east  of the Sandia Mountains forced race officials to delay the  planned launch. The next launch window, Tuesday, October  10, showed a potential track east, paralleling Interstate 40.  

During the 3-day weather delay, Cayton had reason to  reevaluate some strategic issues regarding the flight. One  concern was the fact that both he and Knapp were fairly large  men; he felt that this might place them at some disadvantage  over teams with smaller pilots. Smaller pilots are able to carry  more ballast, and thus can extend their flight time. Also,  while disappointed with the no-fly situation at the Gordon  Bennett, he realized that this might provide an advantage, as  he would not be attempting a second duration flight while  still fatigued from the Gordon Bennett. Cayton believed that  these two issues balanced out, and continued with Knapp to  prepare for the launch.  

Tuesday, October 10, arrived clear and cold; the cold front  and low-pressure system that had delayed the initial launch  had passed through the Albuquerque area and was now  ahead of them. A massive cold front would push through  Canada into the central United States and move to the Gulf  of Mexico during the second day of flight. The plan was to  stay between the two systems to remain competitive and safe.  With crew chief Ken Draughn and help from competitors  Peter Cuneo and Bert Padelt, the inflation went smoothly.  [Figure 11-12]

Figure 11-12.   Inflation of the America’s Challenge balloons,  Albuquerque, NM, October 2006.  

As launch position had been previously drawn by lot, the  Cayton-Knapp team was the fifth balloon to launch. Early on  the evening of the 10th, Cayton handed two bags of ballast  to the balloonmeister, Stefan Handl, and they were in the air.  The race was on! Knapp remembers many “good luck” calls  from the crowd; the chase crew mounted their vehicle and  departed the launch field not knowing they would have a role  in one of the most controversial events in years  

Cayton-Knapp tracked more easterly than the balloons that  had previously launched and stayed well north of highway  I-40 as they crossed the Sandia Mountains. Their altitude  was well above 10,000 feet the first night and averaged  30 miles per hour (mph) with the temperature in the low  30’s. Cayton and Knapp spent most of the night colder than  expected and shivering to keep warm. They established radio  contact with Lubbock, Texas Approach at 0630 Wednesday  morning and shortly after experienced the magic of a sunrise  from the air.  

Most of Wednesday was spent flying over Texas, averaging  36 mph. Another team, that of Phil McNutt and Brian Critelli,  flew 90 degrees directly below them passing to the north  just before they reached the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  [Figure 11-13]  Cayton-Knapp could see other balloons in  the distance, but it was unusual to see another team’s balloon  so close in flight. Dallas Approach directed them to fly over  the Class B airspace above 11,000 feet; at that altitude, they  started tracking a more southerly direction.  

![](images/5be9e78475a4a140d374e4ef4340590ba6287644a947a3f83d2a08f980bfc77e.jpg)

Wednesday evening found the team over northern Louisiana.  Most of the night was spent above 2,500 feet flying less  than   $12{\mathrm{~mph}}$  . The strategy was to stay behind the weather  system ahead and to position themselves for Thursday’s  flight. Cayton and Knapp fell behind several teams during  the night, but that served to let them know they were where  they needed to be.  

Thursday morning’s weather forecast was not favorable;  winds on the surface, as well as at 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000  feet were all going out into the Gulf with no options but to  land. Several teams saw this and landed. Meteorologist Day  and Cayton had a long discussion via satellite phone, and  confirmed the winds above 12,000 would hook out into the  Gulf and bring them back to dry land near Panama City,  Florida. All the available meteorological information told  them it would work. If the team wished to stay competitive,  they had to go high and out over the water.  

They began their ascent around 10:00 AM and went out over  the water just east of New Orleans. It was relatively slow  going but Cayton and Knapp finally made it back to land as  planned and began a slow descent around 16:30. Equipment  was secured in anticipation of a possible landing near the  Apalachicola National Forest in the Florida panhandle. After  confirming their position in the race, and with no place to  land, the decision was made to continue the flight through  the night. The weather prognosis was good, the winds would  be relatively calm during the night and remaining ballast was  good, so they calculated the needed distance and time to win  the race.  [Figure 11-14]  

Early on Thursday morning, it appeared that the team’s  patience had paid off. By 0430, they were moving east about  6 mph and were just over Cross City, Florida. At sunrise, they  were 13 miles further east, and just north of Old Town and  Fanning Springs. Surface winds were calm and there was a  thin layer of ground fog. As the sun came up, the balloon  experienced solar heating and ascended to just over 7,000

feet. The flight continued in an easterly direction at   $15\,\mathrm{mph}$  and by 08:00 the team came to the realization that they were  in a perfect position to take over the lead.  

As the Cayton-Knapp team crossed Interstate 75, just south  of Gainesville, Florida, they received word that the German  team of Eimers/Winker  [Figure 11-15,  AC-13 ]  was on the  ground, and near Cayton’s home in Savannah, Georgia.  Cayton and Knapp elected to continue flying until they had  a cushion of 10 miles before beginning their descent.

Figure 11-15.   Tracks of the 2006 America‘s Challenge competitors.  

With surface winds of approximately 3 mph and knowing the  race was won, the team elected to land in Citra, Florida. Their  chase crew was waiting for them in the yard of a cooperative  landowner. After a 60 hour, 20 minute flight covering 1,478  miles, Andy Cayton and Kevin Knapp had beaten the odds  to capture the 2006 America’s Challenge Cup.

Determine the weight of an empty balloon. Then, knowing the  inflated diameter of the pibal, you can read the approximate  vertical velocity of the pibal.  

To get the weight of the empty balloon, weigh 10 empty pibals  on a scale. Take the weight in ounces, and multiply by 28.35  to obtain the weight of the ten balloons in grams. Then, divide  by 10 to obtain the weight of an individual balloon.

1.  Pressures and Temperatures taken from U. S. Standard Atmosphere Supplements, 1966, ESSA,    NASA, USAF; Table 5.2, Geometric Altitudes, English Units 2. Tables assume no effects due to superheating or impurities in lifting gas supply. 3. Entire volume is assumed to be completely filled with lifting gas as would normally be the case on  Notes   initial ascent. 4. For all descending altitudes, or for partially full envelopes, use the gross lift shown for the altitude at   which the envelope would be completely full. This is called the pressure altitude and is equal to the    maximum altitude achieved during the flight, if the envelope was full at that altitude. Gross lift does    NOT change as balloon descends unless additional lifting gas is lost.

Restricted area.  Airspace of defined dimensions within  which the flight of aircraft is restricted in accordance with  certain conditions.  

Return to service.  A certificated mechanic or authorized  inspector must approve an aircraft for return to service after  it has been inspected, repaired, or altered. In addition, an  aircraft that has been modified must be test flown by an  appropriately certificated pilot before return to service.  

Ridge.  In weather, an elongated area of high pressure with  no rotative motion.  

Rip panel.  A deflation panel, usually circular or triangular,  at the top of a balloon envelope, which may be opened by  pulling a line in the basket to allow hot air or gas to escape,  and the envelope to deflate.  

Rotator vent.  See Turning Vent.  

Rotor.  May be found embedded in mountain waves.  Formation usually occurs where wind speeds change in a  wave, or where friction slows the wind near the ground. See  Figure 4-22  of   this handbook for a graphical representation  of rotors.  

Sectional chart.  Published on a routine basis, these charts  are similar to automobile road maps, and provide useful  information regarding airspace, reference points, tower  frequencies, etc., to a balloon pilot. They are generally not  very helpful for navigation, as the scale, 1:500,000, is too  small to be of use to the balloon pilot.  

SIGMET.  Significant Meteorological Information.  

Single Pilot Resource Management.  A variant of the  crew resource management model that is or more practical  application to the balloon pilot. Defined as the “art and  science of managing all resources available to the single pilot  to ensure the successful outcome of the flight.”  

Skew-T plot.  In weather, a graphic depiction of the data  received from a radiosonde.  

Small aircraft.  Aircraft having a maximum certificated  takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less. All currently type- certificated balloons are small aircraft.  

Serial number   $(\mathbf{S}/\mathbf{N})$  .  A number, usually one of a series,  assigned for identification.  

Step descent.  A method of allowing a balloon to lower  toward the ground by reducing the altitude, leveling off, and  repeating the step, to lower the balloon in increments rather  than one continuous motion.  

Superheat.  A gas balloon term, superheat occurs when  the sun heats the gas inside the envelope to a temperature  exceeding that of the ambient air, resulting in expansion of  the gas.  

Superpressure balloon.  (1) A type of hot air balloon which  has no openings to the atmosphere—the mouth is sealed with  a special skirt—and is kept pumped full of air (at a higher  pressure than the atmosphere) by an on-board fan. Used on  moored balloons to allow operations in relatively strong wind.  (2) In gas ballooning, a sealed envelope in which the internal  envelope pressure exceeds that of a non-sealed envelope.  

Suspension lines.  Lines descending from the mouth of  a balloon envelope from which the basket and heater are  suspended.  

Syllabus.  An abstract or digest of training. It is intended to  be a summary of a course of training, and should be brief, yet  comprehensive enough to cover essential information.  

Telling and Doing Technique.  A four-step process teaching  process particularly well suited to teaching physical skills.  

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).  TAFs are valid for  a 24-hour time period, and are updated four times daily. The  TAF reporting system uses the same abbreviations as used  in METAR reports.  

Temperature gauge.  The thermometer system, required in all  type-certificated hot air balloons, that gives a constant reading  of the inside air temperature at the top of the envelope. May be  direct reading or remote, using a thermocouple or thermistor  connected to a gauge in the basket or reading signals sent  by a transmitter.  

Temperature recorder.  A small plastic laminate with  temperature-sensitive paint dots that turn from white or silver  to black, to record permanently the maximum temperature  reached.  

Tensile strength.  The strength of a material that resists the  stresses of trying to stretch or lengthen it.  

Terminal velocity descent.  A term used by balloonists for  the speed obtained when the balloon is allowed to fall until  it apparently stops accelerating, at which point the envelope  acts as a parachute and its vertical speed is no longer affected  by its lifting gas, but only by its shape (which is caused by  design), load, and other factors.  

Tethering.  Operation of a manned balloon secured to the  ground by a series of lines.  

Thermal.  A column of rising air associated with adjacent  areas of differing temperature. Thermal activity caused by the  sun’s heating usually starts 2 to 3 hours after sunrise.  

Time in service.  According to Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations, with respect to maintenance time records, means  the time from the moment an aircraft leaves the surface of the  earth until it touches it at the next point of landing.  

Touch-and-go landing.  An operation by an aircraft that lands  and takes off without stopping.  

Topographic map.  A map depicting area information on a  smaller scale that an aviation sectional chart, and of much  more value to the balloon pilot. Most topographic charts show  areas of vegetation, roads, built-up areas, and the general  topography (or terrain) of a given area.  

Trough.  In weather, an elongated area of low pressure with  no rotative motion.  

Turning vent.  A vent on the side of a hot air balloon envelope  which, when opened, allows escaping air to exit in a manner  causing the balloon to rotate on its axis.  

Type certification.  Official recognition that the design and  operating limitations of an aircraft, engine, or propeller meet  the airworthiness standards prescribed by the Code of Federal  Regulations for that particular category or type of aircraft,  engine, or propeller.  

Uncontrolled lift.  Lift that occurs without specific action by  the pilot. Often referred to as false lift.  

Useful lift (load).  The potential weight of the pilot,  passengers, equipment and fuel. It is the basic empty weight  of the aircraft subtracted from the maximum allowable gross  weight.  

VAD winds.  In weather; velocity azimuth display winds are  derived from the output of the 160 or more WRS-88 radar  sites located throughout the United States. The WRS-88 is  configured to produce radar returns off of dust and other  particulate matter in the air, and in turn, those returns can  be used to indicate wind direction and speed at different  altitudes. Generally reported in 1000 foot increments.  

Variometer.  See Vertical Speed Indicator.  

Vent.  (1) The action of opening the vent to cool the air in the  envelope. (2) An envelope opening that will automatically  close.  

Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI).  An instrument that  continuously records the rate at which an aircraft climbs or  descends. Usually measured in FPM. A required instrument  in a balloon.  

Virga.  Precipitation that falls from a cloud and evaporates  before reaching the ground.  

Volume.  The total amount of air or gas (expressed in cubic  feet) contained in a balloon envelope.  

Warm front.  In weather, the leading edge of a warm air mass  displacing a colder air mass.  

Warp.  The threads in a piece of fabric that run the length  of the fabric.  

Weigh-off.  Determine neutral buoyancy of a gas balloon or  airship by taking weight off at launch.  

Wind direction.  The direction the wind is coming from.  

Wind shear.  A strong and sudden shift in wind speed or  direction, which may be either vertical or horizontal. Wind  shear should not be confused with normal wind change, which  is gentler. Wind shear is often associated with the passage of  a weather front, or a strong temperature inversion.  

WINGS Program.  A program that encourages general  aviation pilots to continue training and provides an opportunity  to practice selected maneuvers in a minimum of instruction  time. Participation in the WINGS program relieves a pilot  from compliance with flight review requirements, provided  all WINGS requirements are met. Previously governed by  Advisory Circular 61-91, the WINGS program is available  as on online education program at www.faasafety.gov,  effective mid-2007.  

Vent line.  The line that activates the cooling vent.  

Visual Flight Rules (VFR).  Flight rules governing aircraft  flight when the pilot has visual reference to the ground at  all times.
