EXPLANATION

The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2024), consult the ``List of CFR
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried.
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and
not dropped in error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)).
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force
of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which
approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of
material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative
process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001,
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in
this volume.
An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form.
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in
the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

135.85 of this chapter.
Commercial air tour means a flight conducted for compensation or
hire in an airplane, powered-lift, or rotorcraft where a purpose of the
flight is sightseeing. The FAA may consider the following factors in
determining whether a flight is a commercial air tour:

conduct a sightseeing flight for compensation or hire;
(2) Whether the person offering the flight provided a narrative that
referred to areas or points of interest on the surface below the route
of the flight;
(3) The area of operation;
(4) How often the person offering the flight conducts such flights;
(5) The route of flight;
(6) The inclusion of sightseeing flights as part of any travel

Deadhead transportation means transportation of a flightcrew member
as a passenger or non-operating flightcrew member, by any mode of
transportation, as required by a certificate holder, excluding
transportation to or from a suitable accommodation. All time spent in
deadhead transportation is duty and is not rest. For purposes of
determining the maximum flight duty period in Table B of this part,
deadhead transportation is not considered a flight segment.

there is no intention for further aircraft movement by the same
flightcrew member. A flight duty period includes the duties performed by
the flightcrew member on behalf of the certificate holder that occur
before a flight segment or between flight segments without a required
intervening rest period. Examples of tasks that are part of the flight
duty period include deadhead transportation, training conducted in an
aircraft or flight simulator, and airport/standby reserve, if the above
tasks occur before a flight segment or between flight segments without
an intervening required rest period.
Home base means the location designated by a certificate holder
where a flightcrew member normally begins and ends his or her duty

for a flat sleeping position and is located separate from both the
flight deck and passenger cabin in an area that is temperature-
controlled, allows the flightcrew member to control light, and provides
isolation from noise and disturbance.
(2) Class 2 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin that
allows for a flat or near flat sleeping position; is separated from
passengers by a minimum of a curtain to provide darkness and some sound
mitigation; and is reasonably free from disturbance by passengers or
flightcrew members.
(3) Class 3 rest facility means a seat in an aircraft cabin or
flight deck that reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot
support.
Rest period means a continuous period determined prospectively

Suitable accommodation means a temperature-controlled facility with
sound mitigation and the ability to control light that provides a
flightcrew member with the ability to sleep either in a bed, bunk or in
a chair that allows for flat or near flat sleeping position. Suitable
accommodation only applies to ground facilities and does not apply to
aircraft onboard rest facilities.
Theater means a geographical area in which the distance between the
flightcrew member's flight duty period departure point and arrival point

<r05>
Sec.  120.107  Substances for which testing must be conducted.

Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-
sensitive function for evidence of a prohibited drug during each test
required by Sec.  120.109.

[84 FR 16773, Apr. 23, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  120.109  Types of drug testing required.

Each employer shall conduct the types of testing described in this
section in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart and
the DOT ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing
Programs'' (49 CFR part 40).
(a) Pre-employment drug testing. (1) No employer may hire any
individual for a safety-sensitive function listed in Sec.  120.105
unless the employer first conducts a pre-employment test and receives a
verified negative drug test result for that individual.
(2) No employer may allow an individual to transfer from a
nonsafety-sensitive to a safety-sensitive function unless the employer
first conducts a pre-employment test and receives a verified negative
drug test result for the individual.
(3) Employers must conduct another pre-employment test and receive a
verified negative drug test result before hiring or transferring an
individual into a safety-sensitive function if more than 180 days elapse
between conducting the pre-employment test required by paragraphs (a)(1)
or (2) of this section and hiring or transferring the individual into a
safety-sensitive function, resulting in that individual being brought
under an FAA drug testing program.
(4) If the following criteria are met, an employer is permitted to
conduct a pre-employment test, and if such a test is conducted, the
employer must receive a negative test result before putting the
individual into a safety-sensitive function:
(i) The individual previously performed a safety-sensitive function
for the employer and the employer is not required to pre-employment test
the individual under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2)

[[Page 54]]

of this section before putting the individual to work in a safety-
sensitive function;
(ii) The employer removed the individual from the employer's random
testing program conducted under this subpart for reasons other than a
verified positive test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or a refusal
to submit to such testing; and
(iii) The individual will be returning to the performance of a
safety-sensitive function.
(5) Before hiring or transferring an individual to a safety-
sensitive function, the employer must advise each individual that the
individual will be required to undergo pre-employment testing in
accordance with this subpart, to determine the presence of a prohibited
drug in the individual's system. The employer shall provide this same
notification to each individual required by the employer to undergo pre-
employment testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(b) Random drug testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)
through (b)(4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for
random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
(2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this
determination is drawn from the statistical reports required by Sec.
120.119. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain
additional information or reports from employers, and may make
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate.
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year
following publication.
(3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data
received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for two
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is
less than 1.0 percent.
(4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of
this subpart for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive
rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will
increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to
50 percent of all covered employees.
(5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a
computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees'
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time
selections are made.
(6) As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of
employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each
year.
(i) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum
annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random testing
results for safety-sensitive employees by the average number of safety-
sensitive employees eligible for random testing.
(A) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage
rate, count all random positives, random negatives, and random refusals
as your ``random testing results.''
(B) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees
eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of
safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random
testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of
random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an
employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must
be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing
more often than once per

[[Page 55]]

month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly) you do not need to
compute this total number of safety-sensitive employees more than on a
once per month basis.
(ii) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random
selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a
larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate
percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive
employees are in the random testing pool. For example:
(A) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at
least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
(B) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the
testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate
under this part.
(C) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the
testing is conducted at least at the highest rate required for any DOT-
regulated company in the pool.
(7) Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted
under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
(8) Each employer shall require that each safety-sensitive employee
who is notified of selection for random drug testing proceeds to the
collection site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is
performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification,
the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform
the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the collection site as
soon as possible.
(9) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee
shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate
established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than
50 percent of the employee's function.
(10) If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may--
(i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same
required rate; or
(ii) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to
which the employer is subject.
(11) An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the
anti-drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such
agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as
determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's
compliance with the rule.
(c) Post-accident drug testing. Each employer shall test each
employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of a
prohibited drug in the employee's system if that employee's performance
either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted as
a contributing factor to the accident. The employee shall be tested as
soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The
decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on a
determination, using the best information available at the time of the
determination, that the employee's performance could not have
contributed to the accident. The employee shall submit to post-accident
testing under this section.
(d) Drug testing based on reasonable cause. Each employer must test
each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is
reasonably suspected of having used a prohibited drug. The decision to
test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the
employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific
contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of
probable drug use. At least two of the employee's supervisors, one of
whom is trained

[[Page 56]]

in detection of the symptoms of possible drug use, must substantiate and
concur in the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected
of drug use; except that in the case of an employer, other than a part
121 certificate holder, who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform
safety-sensitive functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection
of symptoms of possible drug use must substantiate the decision to test
an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use.
(e) Return to duty drug testing. Each employer shall ensure that
before an individual is returned to duty to perform a safety-sensitive
function after refusing to submit to a drug test required by this
subpart or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test
conducted under this subpart the individual shall undergo a return-to-
duty drug test. No employer shall allow an individual required to
undergo return-to-duty testing to perform a safety-sensitive function
unless the employer has received a verified negative drug test result
for the individual. The test cannot occur until after the SAP has
determined that the employee has successfully complied with the
prescribed education and/or treatment.
(f) Follow-up drug testing. (1) Each employer shall implement a
reasonable program of unannounced testing of each individual who has
been hired to perform or who has been returned to the performance of a
safety-sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug test
required by this subpart or receiving a verified positive drug test
result on a test conducted under this subpart.
(2) The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by
the employer's Substance Abuse Professional conducted in accordance with
the provisions of 49 CFR part 40, but shall consist of at least six
tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty.
(3) The employer must direct the employee to undergo testing for
alcohol in accordance with subpart F of this part, in addition to drugs,
if the Substance Abuse Professional determines that alcohol testing is
necessary for the particular employee. Any such alcohol testing shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40.
(4) Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the
individual begins to perform or returns to the performance of a safety-
sensitive function. The Substance Abuse Professional may terminate the
requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests
have been conducted, if the Substance Abuse Professional determines that
such testing is no longer necessary.

(b) Medical Review Officer (MRO). The MRO must perform the functions
set forth in subpart G of 49 CFR part 40, and subpart E of this part.
The MRO shall not delay verification of the primary test result
following a request for a split specimen test unless such delay is based
on reasons other than the fact that the split specimen test result is
pending. If the primary test result is verified as positive, actions
required under this rule (e.g., notification to the Federal Air Surgeon,
removal from safety-sensitive position) are not stayed during the 72-
hour request period or pending receipt of the split specimen test
result.
(c) Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP must perform the
functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40, subpart O.
(d) Additional Medical Review Officer, Substance Abuse Professional,

individual must answer whether he or she holds an airman medical
certificate issued under 14 CFR part 67 or would be required to hold an
airman medical certificate to perform a safety-sensitive function for
the employer. If the individual answers in the affirmative to either
question, in addition to notifying the employer in accordance with 49
CFR part 40, the MRO must forward to the Federal Air Surgeon, at the
address listed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the name of the
individual, along with identifying information and supporting
documentation, within 2 working days after verifying a positive drug
test result or refusal to submit to a test.
(2) During the SAP interview required for a verified positive test
result or a refusal to submit to a test, the SAP must ask and the
individual must answer whether he or she holds or would be required to
hold an airman medical certificate issued under 14 CFR part 67 to
perform a safety-sensitive function for the employer. If the individual
answers in the affirmative, the individual must obtain an airman medical
certificate issued by the Federal

[[Page 58]]

Air Surgeon dated after the verified positive drug test result date or
refusal to test date. After the individual obtains this airman medical
certificate, the SAP may recommend to the employer that the individual
may be returned to a safety-sensitive position. The receipt of an airman
medical certificate does not alter any obligations otherwise required by
49 CFR part 40 or this subpart.
(3) An employer must forward to the Federal Air Surgeon within 2
working days of receipt, copies of all reports provided to the employer
by a SAP regarding the following:
(i) An individual who the MRO has reported to the Federal Air

120-2, 79 FR 9973, Feb. 21, 2014]


<r05>
Sec.  120.217  Tests required.

(a) Pre-employment alcohol testing. As an employer, you may, but are
not required to, conduct pre-employment alcohol testing under this
subpart. If you

[[Page 64]]

choose to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, you must comply with
the following requirements:
(1) You must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first
performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee
(whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position
involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).
(2) You must treat all safety-sensitive employees performing safety-
sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol
testing (i.e., you must not test some covered employees and not others).
(3) You must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a
contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee
passing the pre-employment alcohol test.
(4) You must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the
alcohol testing procedures of 49 CFR part 40.
(5) You must not allow a covered employee to begin performing
safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test
indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04. If a pre-
employment test result under this paragraph indicates an alcohol
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, the provisions of
Sec.  120.221(f) apply.
(b) Post-accident alcohol testing. (1) As soon as practicable
following an accident, each employer shall test each surviving covered
employee for alcohol if that employee's performance of a safety-
sensitive function either contributed to the accident or cannot be
completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The
decision not to administer a test under this section shall be based on
the employer's determination, using the best available information at
the time of the determination, that the covered employee's performance
could not have contributed to the accident.
(2) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2
hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on
file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly
administered. If a test required by this section is not administered
within 8 hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts
to administer an alcohol test and shall prepare and maintain the same
record. Records shall be submitted to the FAA upon request of the
Administrator or his or her designee.
(3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing shall
remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the
employer to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention
for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered
employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary
to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain
necessary emergency medical care.
(c) Random alcohol testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs
(c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage
rate for random alcohol testing will be 25 percent of the covered
employees.
(2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum
annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the
violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for this
determination is drawn from MIS reports required by this subpart. In
order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the
quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional
information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate
modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual
percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered employees. The new
minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be
applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following
publication.
(3)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol
testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to
10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that
the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less
than 0.5 percent.

[[Page 65]]

(ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol
testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25
percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that
the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for
two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less
than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
(4)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol
testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting
requirements of this subpart for that calendar year indicate that the
violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent but less than 1.0
percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage
rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees.
(ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol
testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting
requirements of this subpart for that calendar year indicate that the
violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the
Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for
random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
(5) The selection of employees for random alcohol testing shall be
made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or
a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees'
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time
selections are made.
(6) As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of
employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each
year.
(i) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum
annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random alcohol
screening test results for safety-sensitive employees by the average
number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing.
(A) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage
rate, count all random screening test results below 0.02 breath alcohol
concentration, random screening test results of 0.02 or greater breath
alcohol concentration, and random refusals as your ``random alcohol
screening test results.''
(B) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees
eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of
safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random
testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of
random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an
employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must
be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing
more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-
weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of safety-sensitive
employees more than on a once per month basis.
(ii) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random
selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a
larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate
percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive
employees are in the random testing pool. For example:
(A) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at
least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
(B) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the
testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate
under this part.
(C) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool
combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the
testing is conducted at least at the highest

[[Page 66]]

rate required for any DOT-regulated company in the pool.
(7) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol tests conducted
under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
(8) Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is
notified of selection for random testing proceeds to the testing site
immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing a
safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the employer
shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-
sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.
(9) A covered employee shall only be randomly tested while the
employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the
employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the
employee has ceased performing such functions.
(10) If a given covered employee is subject to random alcohol
testing under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the
employee shall be subject to random alcohol testing at the percentage
rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more
than 50 percent of the employee's functions.
(11) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol testing
under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the
employer may--
(i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same
required rate; or
(ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to
which the employer is subject.
(d) Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing. (1) An employer shall
require a covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the
employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has
violated the alcohol misuse prohibitions in Sec. Sec.  120.19 or 120.37.
(2) The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the
appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The required
observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting
the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the
breath alcohol test on that employee.
(3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the
observations required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section are made
during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that
the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this rule. An
employee may be directed by the employer to undergo reasonable suspicion
testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing safety-
sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-
sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing
such functions.
(4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within
2 hours following the determination made under paragraph (d)(2) of this
section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test
required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following
the determination made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the
employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall
state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.
(ii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol
test under this section, no covered employee shall report for duty or
remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions
while the employee is under the influence of, or impaired by, alcohol,

the employee has violated the alcohol misuse provisions in Sec. Sec.
120.19 or 120.37.
(iii) No employer shall take any action under this subpart against a
covered employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance
in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an employer
with authority independent of this subpart from taking any action
otherwise consistent with law.

drugs in accordance with subpart E of this part, in addition to alcohol,
if the SAP determines that drug testing is necessary for the particular
employee. Any such drug testing shall be conducted in accordance with
the provisions of 49 CFR part 40.
(4) Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the
individual begins to perform, or returns to the performance of, a
safety-sensitive function. The SAP may terminate the requirement for
follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been
conducted, if the SAP determines that such testing is no longer
necessary.
(5) A covered employee shall be tested for alcohol under this
section only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive
functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive
functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such
functions.
(g) Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of
0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each employer shall retest a covered
employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of Sec.  120.221(f) if

certificate in order to perform a safety-sensitive duty may perform that
duty following a violation of this subpart until the covered employee
obtains an airman medical certificate issued by the Federal Air Surgeon
dated after the alcohol test result or refusal to test date. After the
covered employee obtains this airman medical certificate, the SAP may
recommend to the employer that the covered employee may be returned to a
safety-sensitive position. The receipt of an airman medical certificate
does not alter any obligations otherwise required by 49 CFR part 40 or
this subpart.
(5) Once the Federal Air Surgeon has recommended under paragraph
(c)(4) of this section that the employee be permitted to perform safety-
sensitive duties, the employer cannot permit the employee to perform

employee who has engaged in such conduct to perform safety-sensitive
functions unless the employee has met the requirements of 49 CFR part
40.

functions, until:
(i) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or
(ii) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty
period, but not less than 8 hours following administration of the test.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, no
employer shall take any action under this rule against an employee based
solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04.
This does not prohibit an employer with authority independent

[[Page 70]]

sections 4b.484(a)(1) and 4b.487(e)), as in effect May 16, 1953, must be
complied with; and
(4) The provisions of paragraph 4b.484(a)(1), as in effect July 20,
1950, must be complied with.


In determining the takeoff path in accordance with section 4b.116 and
the one-engine inoperative climb in accordance with section 4b.120 (a)
and (b), the propeller of the inoperative engine may be assumed to be
feathered if the airplane is equipped with either an approved means for
automatically indicating when the particular engine has failed or an
approved means for automatically feathering the propeller of the
inoperative engine. The Administrator may authorize deviations from
compliance with the requirements of sections 4b.130 through 4b.190 and
subparts C, D, E, and F of part 4b (as designated in this paragraph) if
he finds that (considering the effect of design changes) compliance is
extremely difficult to accomplish and that service experience with the
C-46 airplane justifies the deviation.

Sec.  121.163  Aircraft proving tests.

(a) Initial airplane proving tests. No person may operate an
airplane not before proven for use in a kind of operation under this
part or part 135 of this chapter unless an airplane of that type has
had, in addition to the airplane certification tests, at least 100 hours
of proving tests acceptable to the Administrator, including a
representative number of flights into en route airports. The requirement
for at least 100 hours of proving tests may be reduced by the
Administrator if the Administrator determines that a satisfactory level
of proficiency has been demonstrated to justify the reduction. At least
10 hours of proving flights must be flown at night; these tests are
irreducible.
(b) Proving tests for kinds of operations. Unless otherwise
authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane, a
certificate holder must conduct at least 50 hours of proving tests
acceptable to the Administrator for each kind of operation it intends to
conduct, including a representative number of flights into en route
airports.
(c) Proving tests for materially altered airplanes. Unless otherwise
authorized by the Administrator, for each type of airplane that is

<r05>
Sec.  121.171  Applicability.

(a) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating
limitations for all certificate holders.
(b) For purposes of this part, effective length of the runway for
landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction
clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway
intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end thereof.
(c) For the purposes of this subpart, obstruction clearance plane
means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the
horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a
specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that
area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides
with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the
obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and
proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point.
Thereafter the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the
ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument
approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of
these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns
of at least 4,000 foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the
obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends
laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the
obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this
width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet
on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway;
thereafter it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

Sec.  121.173  General.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each
certificate holder operating a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane
shall comply with Sec. Sec.  121.175 through 121.187.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each
certificate holder operating a turbine-engine-powered airplane shall
comply with the applicable provisions of Sec. Sec.  121.189 through
121.197, except that when it operates--
(1) A turbo-propeller-powered airplane type certificated after
August 29, 1959, but previously type certificated with the same number
of reciprocating engines, the certificate holder may comply with
Sec. Sec.  121.175 through 121.187; or
(2) Until December 20, 2010, a turbo-propeller-powered airplane
described in Sec.  121.157(f), the certificate holder may comply with
the applicable performance requirements of appendix K of this part.
(c) Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category
airplane type certificated before January 1, 1965, shall comply with
Sec. Sec.  121.199 through 121.205 and any determination of compliance
must be based only on approved performance data.
(d) The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in
determining compliance with Sec. Sec.  121.175 through 121.197. Where
conditions are different from those on which the performance data is
based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the
effects of changes in the specific variables if the results of the
interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the
results of direct tests.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person
may take off a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane at a weight that is
more than the allowable weight for the runway being used (determined
under the runway takeoff limitations of the operating rules of 14 CFR
part 121, subpart I) after taking into account the temperature operating
correction factors in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual.
(f) The Administrator may authorize in the operations specifications
deviations from the requirements in the subpart if special circumstances
make a literal observance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.
(g) The ten-mile width specified in Sec. Sec.  121.179 through
121.183 may be reduced to five miles, for not more than 20 miles, when
operating VFR or where

[[Page 98]]

navigation facilities furnish reliable and accurate identification of
high ground and obstructions located outside of five miles, but within
ten miles, on each side of the intended track.

Sec.  121.175  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Weight limitations.

(a) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane
from an airport located at an elevation outside of the range for which
maximum takeoff weights have been determined for that airplane.
(b) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane
for an airport of intended destination that is located at an elevation
outside of the range for which maximum landing weights have been
determined for that airplane.
(c) No person may specify, or have specified, an alternate airport
that is located at an elevation outside of the range for which maximum
landing weights have been determined for the reciprocating engine
powered airplane concerned.
(d) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane
at a weight more than the maximum authorized takeoff weight for the
elevation of the airport.
(e) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered airplane
if its weight on arrival at the airport of destination will be more than
the maximum authorized landing weight for the elevation of that airport,
allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil en route.
(f) This section does not apply to large nontransport category
airplanes operated under Sec.  121.173(c).

<r05>
Sec.  121.177  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Takeoff limitations.

(a) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may
takeoff that airplane unless it is possible--
(1) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the
accelerate stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching
critical-engine failure speed;
(2) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane
reaches critical-engine failure speed V<inf>1</inf>, to continue the
takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path
data, before passing over the end of the runway; and
(3) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as
shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the
airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries,
without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the
takeoff path data) and thereafter without banking more than 15 degrees.
(b) In applying this section, corrections must be made for the
effective runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based
on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50
percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent
of any reported tailwind component.
(c) This section does not apply to large nontransport category
airplanes operated under Sec.  121.173(c).

Sec.  121.179  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: En route
limitations: All engines operating.

(a) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may
take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of
fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute),
with all engines operating, of at least 6.90 VSo (that is, the number of
feet per minute is obtained by multiplying the number of knots by 6.90)
at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or
obstruction within ten miles of each side of the intended track.
(b) This section does not apply to airplanes certificated under part
4a of the Civil Air Regulations.

<r05>
Sec.  121.181  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: En route
limitations: One engine inoperative.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person
operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that
airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil,
that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute), with one
engine inoperative, of at least

(0.079-0.106/N) V<inf>so</inf>2


(where N is the number of engines installed and VSo is expressed in
knots) at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or
obstruction within 10 miles of each side of the intended track. However,
for the purposes of this paragraph the rate of climb for airplanes
certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations is 0.026 Vso2.
(b) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a
person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine
powered airplane, at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the
airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport
where a landing can be made in accordance with Sec.  121.187, allowing
for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the
flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles
on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.
(c) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is
used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:
(1) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual
for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the
airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount, in feet per
minute, equal to

(0.079-0.106/N) V<inf>so</inf>2


(when N is the number of engines installed and VS<inf>o</inf> is
expressed in knots) for airplanes certificated under part 25 of this
chapter and by 0.026 Vso2 for airplanes certificated under part 4a of
the Civil Air Regulations.
(2) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that
in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along
the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined
alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff
weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction
following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical
obstruction than the nearest approved radio navigational fix, unless the
Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon
finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.
(3) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this
procedure.
(4) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for
winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight
path.
(5) In complying with this procedure fuel jettisoning is allowed if
the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program,
that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other
precautions are taken to insure a safe procedure.
(6) The certificate holder shall specify in the dispatch or flight
release an alternate airport that meets the requirements of Sec.
121.625.
(d) This section does not apply to large nontransport category
airplanes operated under Sec.  121.173(c).

Sec.  121.183  Part 25 airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating
engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

(a) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and
having four or more engines unless--
(1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport
that meets the requirements of Sec.  121.187; or

[[Page 100]]

(2) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two
critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 V<inf>so</inf>2 feet per
minute (that is, the number of feet per minute is obtained by
multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of
1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on
each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet,
whichever is higher.
(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is
assumed that--
(1) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with
respect to the takeoff weight:
(2) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating
up to the point where the two engines fail and with two engines
operating beyond that point;
(3) Where the engines are assumed to fail at an altitude above the
prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of
climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the
descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude,
if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is
reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate
of descent to be 0.013 V<inf>so</inf>2 greater than the rate in the
approved performance data; and
(4) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the
point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that
which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting the
requirements of Sec.  121.187 and to arrive at an altitude of at least
1,000 feet directly over that airport.

Sec.  121.185  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing
limitations: Destination airport.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no person
operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that
airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption
of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the
intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each
runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the
intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the
purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination
airport the following is assumed:
(1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the
most favorable direction in still air.
(2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering
the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time
of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of
airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and
allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50
percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the
tailwind component.
(b) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off
because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this
section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified that meets
all of the requirements of this section except that the airplane can
accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length
of the runway.
(c) This section does not apply to large nontransport category
airplanes operated under Sec.  121.173(c).

anticipated at the time of arrival at the airport), based on the
assumptions in Sec.  121.185, can be brought to a full stop landing,
within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

Sec.  121.189  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

(a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take
off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane
Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient
temperature existing at takeoff.
(b) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane
certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422,
422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed
in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distances required for
takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30,
1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway
distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than \1/
2\ of the takeoff run.
(c) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane
certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane
at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at
which compliance with the following may be shown:
(1) The accelerate-stop distance must not exceed the length of the
runway plus the length of any stopway.
(2) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway
plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway
included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.
(3) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the
runway.
(d) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take
off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane
Flight Manual--
(1) In the case of an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957,
but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that
clears all obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01D) feet vertically (D
is the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the
runway in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport
boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the
boundaries; or
(2) In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958
(SR 422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all
obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at
least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at
least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.
(e) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight
paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must
be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the
effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at
the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum
distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface
condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or
porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight
Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a
porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines
are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the
Administrator.
(f) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the
airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by
the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the
Airplane Flight Manual, and thereafter that the maximum bank is not more
than 15 degrees.
(g) For the purposes of this section the terms, takeoff distance,
takeoff run, net takeoff flight path and takeoff path have the same
meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was
certificated.

Sec.  121.191  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations:
One engine inoperative.

(a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take
off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel
and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine
inoperative, en route net flight path data in the

[[Page 102]]

Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient
temperatures expected en route:
(1) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet
above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each
side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was
certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B) there is a positive slope
at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land
after an engine fails.
(2) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from
the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under
Sec.  121.197, clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute
miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a
positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands
after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after
September 30, 1958 (SR 422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet
above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.
(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is
assumed that--
(1) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;
(2) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine
failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the nearest
approved radio navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a
different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;
(3) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds:
(4) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows
that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to insure a safe
procedure;
(5) The alternate airport is specified in the dispatch or flight
release and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and
(6) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same
as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path
data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

<r05>
Sec.  121.193  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations:
Two engines inoperative.

(a) Airplanes certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October
1, 1958 (SR 422). No person may operate a turbine engine powered
airplane along an intended route unless he complies with either of the
following:
(1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport
that meets the requirements of Sec.  121.197.
(2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route,
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec.
121.197, with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperature
anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of
at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five miles
on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet,
whichever is higher.


For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that if fuel
jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the
engines fail includes enough fuel to continue to the airport and to
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over the airport,
and that the fuel and oil consumption after engine failure is the same
as the consumption allowed for in the net flight path data in the
Airplane Flight Manual.
(b) Aircraft certificated after September 30, 1958, but before
August 30, 1959 (SR 422A). No person may operate a turbine engine
powered airplane along an intended route unless he complies with either

(1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90
minutes (with all engines operating at

[[Page 103]]

cruising power) from an airport that meets the requirements of Sec.
121.197.
(2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route,
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec.
121.197, with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperatures
anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of
at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within 5 miles on
each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 2,000 feet,
whichever is higher.


For the purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it is assumed that
the two engines fail at the most critical point en route, that the
airplane's weight at the point where the engines fail includes enough
fuel to continue to the airport, to arrive at an altitude of at least
1,500 feet directly over the airport, and thereafter to fly for 15
minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both, and that the consumption of
fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption allowed
for in the net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.
(c) Aircraft certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B). No person
may operate a turbine engine powered airplane along an intended route
unless he complies with either of the following:
(1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90
minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport
that meets the requirements of Sec.  121.197.
(2) Its weight, according to the two-engine inoperative, en route,
net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane
to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail
simultaneously to an airport that meets the requirements of Sec.
121.197, with the net flight path (considering the ambient temperatures
anticipated along the track) clearing vertically by at least 2,000 feet
all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles (4.34 nautical
miles) on each side of the intended track. For the purposes of this
subparagraph, it is assumed that--
(i) The two engines fail at the most critical point en route;
(ii) The net flight path has a positive slope at 1,500 feet above
the airport where the landing is assumed to be made after the engines
fail;
(iii) Fuel jettisoning will be approved if the certificate holder
shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is
adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe
procedure;
(iv) The airplane's weight at the point where the two engines are
assumed to fail provides enough fuel to continue to the airport, to
arrive at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet directly over the airport,
and thereafter to fly for 15 minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both;
and
(v) The consumption of fuel and oil after the engine failure is the
same as the consumption that is allowed for in the net flight path data
in the Airplane Flight Manual.


<r05>
Sec.  121.195  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations:
Destination airports.

(a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take
off that airplane at such a weight that (allowing for normal consumption
of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the
weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight set
forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination
or alternate airport and the ambient temperature anticipated at the time
of landing.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this
section, no person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take
off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal
consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing
distance set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of
the destination airport and the wind conditions anticipated there at the
time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended
destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each
runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of
the obstruction clearance plane

[[Page 104]]

and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing
weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:
(1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the
most favorable direction, in still air.
(2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering
the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling
characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such
as landing aids and terrain.
(c) A turbopropeller powered airplane that would be prohibited from
being taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph
(b)(2) of this section, may be taken off if an alternate airport is
specified that meets all the requirements of this section except that
the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the
effective length of the runway.
(d) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing
techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less
than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved
for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane
Flight Manual, no person may takeoff a turbojet powered airplane when
the appropriate weather reports and forecasts, or a combination thereof,
indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or
slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway
length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway
length required under paragraph (b) of this section.
(e) A turbojet powered airplane that would be prohibited from being
taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)
of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified
that meets all the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

<r05>
Sec.  121.197  Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations:
Alternate airports.

No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a dispatch
or flight release for a turbine engine powered airplane unless (based on
the assumptions in Sec.  121.195 (b)) that airplane at the weight
anticipated at the time of arrival can be brought to a full stop landing
within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway for
turbopropeller powered airplanes and 60 percent of the effective length
of the runway for turbojet powered airplanes, from a point 50 feet above
the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. In
the case of an alternate airport for departure, as provided in Sec.
121.617, allowance may be made for fuel jettisoning in addition to
normal consumption of fuel and oil when determining the weight
anticipated at the time of arrival.

any of the following airplanes (certificated under part 4b of the Civil
Air Regulations effective before March 13, 1956) at increased zero fuel
and landing weights--
(1) DC-6A, DC-6B, DC-7B, and DC-7C; and
(2) L1049B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, and the L1649A when modified in
accordance with supplemental type certificate SA 4-1402.
(b) The zero fuel weight (maximum weight of the airplane with no
disposable fuel and oil) and the structural landing weight may be
increased beyond the maximum approved in full compliance with applicable
regulations only if the Administrator finds that--
(1) The increase is not likely to reduce seriously the structural
strength;
(2) The probability of sudden fatigue failure is not noticeably
increased;
(3) The flutter, deformation, and vibration characteristics do not
fall below those required by applicable regulations; and
(4) All other applicable weight limitations will be met.

[[Page 105]]

(c) No zero fuel weight may be increased by more than five percent,
and the increase in the structural landing weight may not exceed the
amount, in pounds, of the increase in zero fuel weight.
(d) Each airplane must be inspected in accordance with the approved
special inspection procedures, for operations at increased weights,
established and issued by the manufacturer of the type of airplane.
(e) Each airplane operated under this section must be operated in
accordance with the passenger-carrying performance operating limitations
prescribed in this part.
(f) The Airplane Flight Manual for each airplane operated under this
section must be appropriately revised to include the operating
limitations and information needed for operation at the increased
weights.
(g) Except as provided for the carrying of persons under Sec.
121.583 each airplane operated at an increased weight under this section
must, before it is used in passenger service, be inspected under the
special inspection procedures for return to passenger service
established and issued by the manufacturer and approved by the
Administrator.


<r05>
Sec.  121.199  Nontransport category airplanes: Takeoff limitations.

(a) No person operating a nontransport category airplane may take
off that airplane at a weight greater than the weight that would allow
the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of
the runway, from any point during the takeoff before reaching 105
percent of minimum control speed (the minimum speed at which an airplane
can be safely controlled in flight after an engine becomes inoperative)
or 115 percent of the power off stalling speed in the takeoff
configuration, whichever is greater.
(b) For the purposes of this section--
(1) It may be assumed that takeoff power is used on all engines
during the acceleration;
(2) Not more than 50 percent of the reported headwind component, or
not less than 150 percent of the reported tailwind component, may be
taken into account;
(3) The average runway gradient (the difference between the
elevations of the endpoints of the runway divided by the total length)
must be considered if it is more than one-half of 1 percent;
(4) It is assumed that the airplane is operating in standard
atmosphere; and
(5) The effective length of the runway for takeoff means the
distance from the end of the runway at which the takeoff is started to a
point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the other
end of the runway intersects the runway centerline.

<r05>
Sec.  121.201  Nontransport category airplanes: En route limitations:
One engine inoperative.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person
operating a nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at
a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a
minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least
1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side
of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the
Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may
operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of
engine failure, to clear all obstructions within 5 miles on each side of
the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of
descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet
a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before
approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following
for the route, route segment, or area concerned:
(1) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.
(2) The location and kinds of navigation aids.
(3) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency
and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

[[Page 106]]

(4) Terrain features.
(5) Air traffic control problems.
(6) Any other operational factors that affect the operation.
(c) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--
(1) The critical engine is inoperative;
(2) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag
position;
(3) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable
position;
(4) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous
power available;
(5) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and
(6) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the
anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.


<r05>
Sec.  121.203  Nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations:
Destination airport.

(a) No person operating a nontransport category airplane may take
off that airplane at a weight that--
(1) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater
than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent
of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination
airport; and
(2) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be
made on the runway--
(i) With the greatest effective length in still air; and
(ii) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more
than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent
of the tailwind component.
(b) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--
(1) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the
obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a
steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3
VS<inf>o</inf>;
(2) The landing does not require exceptional pilot skill; and
(3) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere.


<r05>
Sec.  121.205  Nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations:
Alternate airport.

No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a dispatch
or flight release for a nontransport category airplane unless that
airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival) based on the
assumptions contained in Sec.  121.203, can be brought to a full stop
landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

such an airplane only those persons who are listed in Sec.  121.547(c)
or who are specifically authorized by both the certificate holder and
the Administrator.
(b) Each certificate holder shall keep a log of each flight
conducted under this section and shall keep accurate and complete
records of each inspection made and all maintenance performed on the
airplane. The certificate holder shall make the log and records made
under this section available to the manufacturer and the Administrator.
