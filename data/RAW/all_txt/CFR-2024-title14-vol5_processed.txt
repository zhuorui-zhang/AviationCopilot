EXPLANATION

The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2024), consult the ``List of CFR
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried.
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and
not dropped in error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)).
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force
of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which
approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of
material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative
process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001,
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in
this volume.
An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form.
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in
the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

the United States shall be the responsibility of, and shall be directed
by, the Department of Defense.


<r05>
Sec.  1201.102  Functions.

In order to carry out the purpose of the Act, NASA is authorized to
conduct research for the solution of problems of flight within and
outside the Earth's atmosphere; to develop, construct, test, and operate
aeronautical and space vehicles for research purposes; to operate a
space transportation system including the space shuttle, upper stages,
space program, space station, and related equipment; and to perform such
other activities as may be required for the exploration of space. The
term aeronautical and space vehicles means aircraft, missiles,
satellites, and other space vehicles, together with related equipment,
devices, components, and parts. It conducts activities required for the
exploration of space with manned and unmanned vehicles and arranges for
the most effective utilization of the scientific and engineering
resources of the United States with other nations engaged in
aeronautical and space activities for peaceful purposes.


<r05>
Sec.  1201.103  Administration.

(a) NASA is headed by an Administrator, who is appointed from
civilian life by the President by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate. The Administrator is responsible, under the supervision and
direction of the President, for exercising all powers and discharging
all duties of NASA.
(b) The Deputy Administrator of NASA is also appointed by the
President from civilian life by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate. The Deputy Administrator acts with or for the Administrator
within the full scope of the Administrator's responsibilities. In the
Administrator's absence, the Deputy Administrator serves as Acting
Administrator.


<r04>
Subpart 2_Organization


<r05>
Sec.  1201.200  General.

NASA's basic organization consists of the Headquarters, nine field
Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally Funded Research and
Development Center), and several component installations which report to
Center Directors. Responsibility for overall

[[Page 6]]

planning, coordination, and control of NASA programs is vested in NASA
Headquarters located in Washington, DC. For additional information,

Subpart 3_Boards and Committees


<r05>
Sec.  1201.300  Boards and committees.

(a) NASA's Contract Adjustment Board (CAB) and Inventions and
Contributions Board (ICB) were established as part of the permanent
organization structure of NASA. Charters for both Boards are set forth
in part 1209 of this chapter. Procedures for the CAB are set out in 48
CFR part 1850, and procedures for the ICB are set out in 14 CFR parts
1240 and 1245.
(b) The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) is a
neutral, independent forum whose primary function is to hear and decide
post-award contract disputes between government contractors and those
entities with whom the ASBCA has entered into agreement to provide
services (NASA is one of those entities). The ASBCA functions in
accordance with the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 7101-7109), its
Charter, or other remedy-granting provisions. Information about the
ASBCA can be obtained by mail at ASBCA, Skyline 6, Suite 700, 5109

Subpart A_Scope


<r05>
Sec.  1203.100  Legal basis.

(a) Executive Order 13526 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Order''). The responsibilities and authority of the Administrator of
NASA with respect to the original classification of official information
or material requiring protection against unauthorized disclosure in the
interest of national defense or foreign relations of the United States
(hereinafter collectively termed ``national security''), and the
standards for such classification, are established by the ``the Order''
and the Information Security Oversight Office Directive No. 1, as
amended (32 CFR part 2001, ``Classified National Security
Information'');
(b) E.O. 10865. Executive Order 10865 (24 FR 1583) requires the
Administrator to prescribe by regulation such specific requirements,
restrictions and other safeguards as the Administrator may consider
necessary to protect:
(1) Releases of classified information to or within United States
industry that relate to contracts with NASA; and
(2) Other releases of classified information to industry that NASA
has responsibility for safeguarding.
(c) The National Aeronautics and Space Act. (1) The National
Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20113) (Hereafter referred to as,
``The Space Act''), states:

The Administrator shall establish such security requirements,
restrictions, and safeguards as he deems necessary in the interest of
the national security * * *

(2) Section 303 of the Space Act states:

Information obtained or developed by the Administrator in the
performance of his functions under this Act shall be made available for
public inspection, except (i) information authorized or required by
Federal statute to be withheld, and (ii) information classified to
protect the national security: Provided, That nothing in this Act shall
authorize the withholding of information by the Administrator from the
duly authorized committees of the Congress.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5889, Feb. 9, 1983; 64

Subpart B_NASA Information Security Program


<r05>
Sec.  1203.200  Background and discussion.

(a) In establishing a civilian space program, the Congress required
NASA to ``provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof,'' and for the withholding from public inspection of that
information that is classified to protect the national security.
(b) The Order was promulgated in recognition of the essential
requirement for an informed public concerning the activities of its
Government, as well as the need to protect certain national security
information from unauthorized disclosure. It delegates to NASA certain
responsibility for matters pertaining to national security and confers
on the Administrator of NASA, or such responsible officers or employees
as the Administrator may designate, the authority for original
classification of official information or material which requires
protection in the interest of national security. It also provides for:

[[Page 8]]

(1) Basic classification, downgrading and declassification
guidelines;
(2) The issuance of directives prescribing the procedures to be
followed in safeguarding classified information or material;
(3) A monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of the Order;
(4) Appropriate administrative sanctions against officers and
employees of the United States Government who are found to be in
violation of the Order or implementing directive; and
(5) Classification limitations and restrictions as discussed in
Sec. Sec.  1203.410 and 1203.411.
(c) The Order requires the timely identification and protection of
that NASA information the disclosure of which would be contrary to the
best interest of national security. Accordingly, the determination in
each case must be based on a judgment as to whether disclosure of
information could reasonably be expected to result in damage to the
national security.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5889, Feb. 9, 1983; 78
FR 5117, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.201  Information security objectives.

The objectives of the NASA Information Security Program are to:
(a) Ensure that information is classified only when a sound basis
exists for such classification and only for such period as is necessary.
(b) Prevent both the unwarranted classification and the
overclassification of NASA information.
(c) Ensure the greatest practicable uniformity within NASA in the
classification of information.
(d) Ensure effective coordination and reasonable uniformity with
other Government departments and agencies, particularly in areas where
there is an exchange or sharing of information, techniques, hardware,
software, or other technologies.
(e) Provide a timely and effective means for downgrading or
declassifying information when the circumstances necessitating the
original classification change or no longer exist.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5117, Jan. 24, 2013]

which are duplicative or unnecessary are eliminated.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 3888, Jan. 21, 1980; 48
FR 5890, Feb. 9, 1983; 53 FR 41318, Oct. 21, 1988; 64 FR 72535, Dec. 28,
1999; 78 FR 5117, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.203  Degree of protection.

(a) General. Upon determination that information or material must be
classified, the degree of protection commensurate with the sensitivity
of the information must be determined. If there is reasonable doubt
about the need to classify information, it shall be safeguarded as if it
were classified pending a determination by an original classification
authority, who shall make this determination within 30 days. If there is
reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall
be safeguarded at the higher level of classification pending a
determination by an original classification authority, who shall make
this determination within 30 days.
(b) Authorized categories of classification. The three categories of
classification, as authorized and defined in ``the Order,'' are set out
below. No other restrictive markings are authorized to be placed on NASA
classified documents or materials except as expressly provided by
statute or by NASA Directives.
(1) Top Secret. Top Secret is the designation applied to information
or material, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.
(2) Secret. Secret is the designation applied to information or
material, the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be
expected to cause serious damage to the national security.
(3) Confidential. Confidential is the designation applied to that
information or material for which the unauthorized disclosure could
reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5890, Feb. 9, 1983; 78

[[Page 10]]


<r04>
Subpart C_Classification Principles and Considerations


<r05>
Sec.  1203.300  General.

In general, the types of NASA-generated information and material
requiring protection in the interest of national security lie in the
areas of applied research, technology or operations.


<r05>
Sec.  1203.301  Identification of information requiring protection.

Classifiers shall identify the level of classification of each
classified portion of a document (including subject and titles), and
those portions that are not classified.


<r05>
Sec.  1203.302  Compilation.

A compilation of items that are individually unclassified may be
classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association
or relationship that meets the standards of classification under the
Order; and is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of
information. As used in the Order, compilations mean an aggregate of
pre-existing unclassified items of information.

[78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.303  Distribution controls.

NASA shall establish controls over the distribution of classified
information to ensure that it is dispersed only to organizations or
individuals eligible for access to such information and with a need-to-
know the information.

[78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.304  Internal effect.

The effect of security protection on program progess and cost and on
other functional activities of NASA should be considered. Impeditive
effects and added costs inherent in a security classification must be
assessed and weighed against the detrimental effects on the national
security interests which would result from failure to classify.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.305  Restricted data.

Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data is so classified when
originated or by operation of the law, as required by the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954, as amended. Specific guidance for the classification of
Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data is provided in
``Classification Guides'' published by the Department of Energy and or
Department of Defense.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r04>
Subpart D_Guides for Original Classification


<r05>
Sec.  1203.400  Specific classifying guidance.

Technological and operational information and material, and in some
exceptional cases scientific information falling within any one or more
of the following categories, must be classified if its unauthorized
disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause some degree of damage
to the national security. In cases where it is believed that a contrary
course of action would better serve the national interests, the matter
should be referred to the Chairperson, NISPC, for a determination. It is
not intended that this list be exclusive; original classifiers are
responsible for initially classifying any other type of information
which, in their judgment, requires protection under Sec.  1.4 of ``the
Order.''
(a) Military plans, weapons systems, or operations;
(b) Foreign government information;
(c) Intelligence activities (including covert activities),
intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;
(d) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States,
including confidential sources;
(e) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the
national security;
(f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear
materials or facilities;
(g) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations,
infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the
national security; or

[[Page 11]]

(h) The development, production, or plans relating to the use of
weapons of mass destruction.

[78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.401  Effect of open publication.

Public disclosure, regardless of source or form, of information
currently classified or being considered for classification does not
preclude initial or continued classification. However, such disclosure
requires an immediate reevaluation to determine whether the information
has been compromised to the extent that downgrading or declassification
is indicated. Similar consideration must be given to related items of
information in all programs, projects, or items incorporating or
pertaining to the compromised items of information. In these cases, if a
release were made or authorized by an official Government source,
classification of clearly identified items may no longer be warranted.
Questions as to the propriety of continued classification should be
referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program
Committee.


<r05>
Sec.  1203.402  Classifying material other than documentation.

Items of equipment or other physical objects may be classified only
where classified information may be derived by visual observation of
internal or external appearance, structure, operation, test, application
or use. The overall classification assigned to equipment or objects
shall be at least as high as the highest classification of any of the
items of information which may be revealed by the equipment or objects,
but may be higher if the classifying authority determines that the sum
of classified or unclassified information warrants such higher
classification. In every instance where classification of an item of
equipment or object is determined to be warranted, such determination
must be based on a finding that there is at least one aspect of the item
or object which requires protection. If mere knowledge of the existence
of the equipment or object would compromise or nullify the reason or
justification for its classification, the fact of its existence should
be classified.


<r05>
Sec.  1203.403  [Reserved]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.404  Handling of unprocessed data.

It is the usual practice to withhold the release of raw scientific
data received from spacecraft until it can be calibrated, correlated and
properly interpreted by the experimenter under the monitorship of the
cognizant NASA office. During this process, the data are withheld
through administrative measures, and it is not necessary to resort to
security classification to prevent premature release. However, if at any
time during the processing of raw data it becomes apparent that the
results require protection under the criteria set forth in this subpart
D, it is the responsibility of the cognizant NASA office to obtain the
appropriate security classification.


<r05>
Sec.  1203.405  Proprietary information.

Proprietary information made available to NASA is subject to
examination for classification purposes under the criteria set forth in
this subpart D. Where the information is in the form of a proposal and
accepted by NASA for support, it should be categorized in accordance
with the criteria of Sec.  1203.400. If NASA does not support the
proposal but believes that security classification would be appropriate
under the criteria of Sec.  1203.400 if it were under Government
jurisdiction, the contractor should be advised of the reasons why
safeguarding would be appropriate, unless security considerations
preclude release of the explanation to the contractor. NASA should
identify the Government department, agency or activity whose national
security interests might be involved and the contractor should be
instructed to protect the proposal as though classified pending further
advisory classification opinion by the Government activity whose
interests are involved. If such a Government activity cannot be
identified, the contractor should be advised that the proposal is not
under NASA jurisdiction for classification purposes, and that the
information should be sent, under proper safeguards, to the

[[Page 12]]

Director, Information Security Oversight Office for a determination.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.406  Additional classification factors.

In determining the appropriate classification category, the
following additional factors should be considered:
(a) Uniformity within government activities. The effect
classification will have on technological programs of other Government
departments and agencies should be considered. Classification of
official information must be reasonably uniform within the Government.
(b) Applicability of classification directives of other Government
agencies. It is necessary to determine whether authoritative
classification guidance exists elsewhere for the information under
consideration which would make it necessary to assign a higher
classification than that indicated by the applicable NASA guidance. The
Office of Protective Services will coordinate with the Information
Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Committee and the National
Declassification Center to determine what classification guides are
current.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.407  Duration of classification.

(a) At the time of original classification, the original
classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for
declassification based on the duration of the national security
sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the
information shall be automatically declassified. Except for information
that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity
of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key
design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the date or event shall
not exceed the timeframe established in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an
earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall
be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original
decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise
determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be
marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the
original decision.
(c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of
classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document,
change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information
only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under
this Order are followed.
(d) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information
that is marked for an indefinite duration of classification under
predecessor orders, for example, information marked as ``Originating
Agency's Determination Required,'' or classified information that
contains either incomplete or no declassification instructions, shall
have appropriate declassification information applied in accordance with
part 3 of this order.

[78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.408  Assistance by Information Security Specialist in the
Center Protective Services Office.

Center Security Classification Officers, as the Center point-of-
contact, will assist Center personnel in:
(a) Interpreting security classification guides and classification
assignments for the Center.
(b) Answering questions and considering suggestions concerning
security classification matters.
(c) Ensuring a continuing review of classified information for the
purpose of declassifying or downgrading in accordance with subpart E of
this part.
(d) Reviewing and approving, as the representative of the
contracting officer, the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification
Specification, issued to contractors by the Center.
(e) Forwarding all security classification guides to the Office of
Protective Services, NASA Headquarters, for final approval.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]

[[Page 13]]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.409  Exceptional cases.

(a) In those cases where a person not authorized to classify
information originates or develops information which is believed to
require classification, that person must contact the Center's or
installation's Information Security Officer in the Protective Services
Office to arrange for proper review and safeguarding. Persons other than
NASA employees should forward the information to the NASA Central
Registry at 300 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20546, Attention: Office of
Protective Services.
(b) Information in which NASA does not have primary interest shall
be returned promptly, under appropriate safeguards, to the sender in
accordance with Sec.  1203.405.
(c) Material received from another agency for a NASA security
classification determination shall be processed within 90 days. If a
classification cannot be determined during that period, the material
shall be sent, under appropriate safeguards, to the Director,
Information Security Oversight Office, for a determination.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5118, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.410  Limitations.

(a) In no case shall information be classified, continue to be
maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to:
(1) Conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative
error;
(2) Prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;
(3) Restrain competition; or
(4) Prevent or delay the release of information that does not
require protection in the interest of the national security.
(b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the
national security may not be classified.
(c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification after
being released to the public under proper authority unless: The
reclassification is based on a document-by-document review by NASA and a
determination that reclassification is required to prevent at least
significant damage to the national security and personally approved in
writing by the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services. All reclassification actions will
be coordinated with the Information Security Oversight Office before
final approval; the information may be reasonably recovered without
bringing undue public attention to the information; the reclassification
action is reported promptly to the Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs (the National Security Advisor) and the
Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and for documents
in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records
Administration (National Archives) that have been available for public
use, the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services, after making the determinations
required by this paragraph, shall notify the Archivist of the United
States (hereafter, Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending
approval of the reclassification action by the Director of the
Information Security Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director
may be appealed by the agency head to the President through the National
Security Advisor. Public access shall remain suspended pending a prompt
decision on the appeal.
(d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public
under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency
has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5
U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions
of section 3.5 of this Order only if such classification meets the
requirements of this Order and is accomplished by document-by-document
review with the personal participation or under the direction of the
Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the Assistant Administrator
for Protective Services. The requirements in this paragraph also apply
to those situations in which information has been declassified in
accordance

[[Page 14]]

with a specific date or event determined by an original classification
authority in accordance with section 1.5 of this Order.
(e) Compilations of items of information that are individually
unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an
additional association or relationship that:
(1) Meets the standards for classification under this Order; and
(2) Is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of
information.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5890, Feb. 9, 1983; 78
FR 5119, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.411  Restrictions.

(a) Except as provided by directives issued by the President through
the National Security Council, classified information originating in one
agency may not be disseminated outside any other agency to which it has
been made available without the consent of the originating agency. For
purposes of this section, the Department of Defense shall be considered
one agency.
(b) Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the
Executive Branch except under conditions that ensure the information
will be given protection equivalent to that afforded within the
Executive Branch.

[48 FR 5890, Feb. 9, 1983]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.412  Classification guides.

(a) General. A classification guide, based upon classification
determinations made by appropriate program and classification
authorities, shall be issued for each classified system, program or
project. Classification guides shall:
(1) Identify the information elements to be protected, using
categorization and subcategorization to the extent necessary to ensure
that the information involved can be readily and uniformly identified.
(2) State which of the classification designations (i.e., Top
Secret, Secret or Confidential) apply to the identified information
elements.
(3) State the duration of each specified classification in terms of
a period of time or future event. If the original classification
authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for
declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10
years from the date of the original decision, unless the original
classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of
the information requires it be marked for declassification for up to 25
years from the date of the original decision.
(4) Indicate specifically that the designations, time limits,
markings and other requirements of ``the Order'' are to be applied to
information classified pursuant to the guide.
(5) All security classification guides should be forwarded to the
Office of Protective Services for review and final approval. The Office
of Protective Services will maintain a list of all classification guides
in current use.
(b) Review of classification guides. Classification guides shall be
reviewed by the originator for currency and accuracy not less than once
every five years. Changes shall be in strict conformance with the
provisions of this part 1203 and shall be issued promptly. If no changes
are made, the originator shall so annotate the record copy and show the
date of the review.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 5891, Feb. 9, 1983; 78

<r04>
Subpart E_Derivative Classification


<r05>
Sec.  1203.500  Use of derivative classification.

(a) Persons who reproduce, extract, or summarize classified
information, or who apply classification markings derived from source
material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess
original classification authority.
(b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:
(1) Be identified by name and position or by personal identifier, in
a manner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification
action;
(2) Observe and respect original classification decisions; and
(3) Carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent
classification markings. For information derivatively classified based
on multiple

[[Page 15]]

sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:
(i) The date or event for declassification that corresponds to the
longest period of classification among the sources or the marking
established pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of the Order; and
(ii) A listing of the source materials.
(c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever practicable, use a
classified addendum when classified information constitutes a small
portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to
allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible
or in unclassified form.
(d) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall
receive training in the proper application of the derivative
classification principles of the Order, with an emphasis on avoiding
over-classification, at least once every two years. Derivative
classifiers who do not receive such training at least once every two
years shall have their authority to apply derivative classification
markings suspended until they have received such training. A waiver may
be granted by the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, or the
Assistant Administrator for Protective Services if an individual is
unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances.
Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training
as soon as practicable.

[78 FR 5119, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.501  Applying derivative classification markings.

Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:
(a) Observe and respect original classification decisions:
(b) Verify the information's current level of classification so far
as practicable before applying the markings; and
(c) Carry forward to newly created documents any assigned authorized
markings. The declassification date or event that provides the longest
period of classification shall be used for documents classified on the
basis of multiple sources.

<r04>
Subpart F_Declassification and Downgrading


<r05>
Sec.  1203.600  Policy.

Information shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national
security considerations permit. NASA reviews of classified information
shall be coordinated with other agencies that have a direct interest in
the subject matter. Information that continues to meet the
classification requirements prescribed by Sec.  1203.400 despite the
passage of time will continue to be protected in accordance with ``the
Order.''

[48 FR 5891, Feb. 9, 1983]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.601  Responsibilities.

Authorized officials with Declassification Authority (DCA) may
declassify or downgrade information that is subject to the final
classification jurisdiction of NASA and shall take such action in
accordance with the provisions of this subpart F.

[44 FR 34913, June 18, 1979, as amended at 78 FR 5120, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.602  Authorization.

Information shall be declassified or downgraded by an authorized DCA
official. If that official is still serving in the same position, the
originator's successor, a supervisory official of either, or officials
delegated such authority in writing by the Administrator or the
Chairperson, NISPC, may also make a decision to declassify or downgrade
information.

[78 FR 5120, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203.603  Systematic review for declassification:

(a) General. (1) NASA must establish and conduct a program for
systematic declassification review of NASA-originated records of
permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification
under section 3.3 of this Order. The NASA Office of Protective Services
shall prioritize the review of

[[Page 16]]

such records in coordination with the Center Protective Service Offices.
(2) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review
program for classified records:
(i) Accessioned into the National Archives;
(ii) Transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and
(iii) For which the National Archives serves as the custodian for an
agency or organization that has gone out of existence.
(3) The Chairperson, NISPC, shall designate experienced personnel to
assist the Archivist in the systematic review of U.S. originated
information and foreign information exempted from automated
declassification. Such personnel shall:
(i) Provide guidance and assistance to the National Archives and
Records Service in identifying and separating documents and specific
categories of information within documents which are deemed to require
continued classification; and
(ii) Develop reports of information or document categories so
separated, with recommendations concerning continued classification.
(iii) Develop, in coordination with NASA organizational elements,
guidelines for the systematic review for declassification of classified
information under NASA's jurisdiction. The guidelines shall state
specific limited categories of information which, because of their
national security sensitivity, should not be declassified automatically,
but should be reviewed to determine whether continued protection beyond
25 years is needed. These guidelines are authorized for use by the
Archivist and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office,
with the approval of the Senior Agency Official, which is the Assistant
Administrator, Office of Protective Services, for categories listed in
section 3.3 of the Order. These guidelines shall be reviewed at least
every five years and revised as necessary, unless an earlier review for
revision is requested by the Archivist. Copies of the declassification
guidelines promulgated by NASA will be provided to the Information
Security Oversight Office, National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA). All security classified records exempt from automatic
declassification, whether held in storage areas under installation
control or in Federal Records Centers, will be surveyed to identify
those requiring scheduling for future disposition.
(A) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises
exclusive or final original classification authority and which is to be
declassified in accordance with the systematic review guidelines shall
be so marked.
(B) Classified information or material over which NASA exercises
exclusive or final original classification authority and which, in
accordance with the systematic review guidelines is to be kept
protected, shall be listed by category by the responsible custodian and
referred to the Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program
Committee. This listing shall:
(1) Identify the information or material involved.
(2) Recommend classification beyond 25 years to a specific event
scheduled to happen or a specific period of time in accordance with the
Order.
(3) The Administrator shall delegate to the Senior Agency Official
the authority to determine which category shall be kept classified and
the dates or event for declassification.
(4) Declassification by the Director of the Information Security
Oversight Office (DISOO). If the Director determines that NASA
information is classified in violation of the Order, the Director may
require the information to be declassified. Any such decision by the
Director may be appealed through the NASA ISPC to the National Security
Council. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt
decision on the appeal.

<r05>
Sec.  1203.604  Mandatory review for declassification.

(a) Information covered. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
section, all information classified under the Order or predecessor
orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the
originating agency if:
(1) The request for a review describes the document or material
containing

[[Page 17]]

the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to
locate it in a reasonably timely manner;
(2) The document or material containing the information responsive
to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from
search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in
accordance with law; and
(3) The information is not the subject of pending litigation.
(b) Presidential papers. Information originated by the President or
Vice President; the President's White House Staff, or the Vice
President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the
President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the
President that solely advise and assist the President are exempted from
the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist
shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or
records of former Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of
the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203.
Procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation
with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be
consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements
that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies
with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the
Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be
appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information
shall remain classified pending a decision on the appeal.
(c) Submission of requests for review. Requests for mandatory review
of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the
following:
(1) Requests originating within NASA shall, in all cases, be
submitted directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services.
(2) For the most expeditious action, requests from other
Governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted
directly to the NASA Office of Protective Services only. The requestor
may submit the request to: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), Central Registry, 300 E Street SW., Washington DC 20546,
Attention: Office of Protective Services/Information Security Program
Manager. The phrase, ``Mandatory Declassification Review,'' must be
stated in the request.
(d) Requirement for processing. (1) Requests which are submitted
under the Freedom of Information Act cannot be processed under the MDR
process.
(2) The request describes the document or material containing the
information with sufficient specificity, such as accession numbers, box
titles or numbers, date and title of document, in any combination, to
enable NASA to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort, not to
exceed 30 days. If more time is required, NASA will notify the
requester. After review, the information or any portion thereof that no
longer requires protection shall be declassified and released unless
withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law.
(e) Processing of requests. Requests that meet the requirements of
paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be processed as follows:
(1) The NASA Office of Protective Services review upon receiving the
initial request shall be completed within 365 days.
(2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged promptly. The NASA
Office of Protective Services shall determine whether, under the
declassification provisions of this part 1203, the requested information
may be declassified and, if so, shall make such information available to
the requestor, unless withholding is otherwise warranted under
applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in
part, the requestor shall be given a brief statement of the reasons for
denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the
Chairperson, NASA Information Security Program Committee, National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546, and a notice
that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in order to be
considered.
(3) All appeals of denials of requests for declassification shall be
acted upon and determined finally within 120 working days after receipt,
and the requester shall be advised that the appeal

[[Page 18]]

determination is final. If the requester is dissatisfied with NASA's
appeal decision, the requester may initiate an appeal to the Interagency
Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP), within the Information
Security Oversight Office. If continued classification is required under
the provisions of this part 1203, the requester shall be notified of the
reasons thereof.
(4) The declassification and release of foreign government
information that is subjected to mandatory review under this section
shall be determined only in accordance with Sec.  1203.703.
(5) When the NASA Office of Protective Services receives any request
for declassification of information in documents in its custody that was
classified by another Government agency, it shall refer copies of the
request and the requested documents to the originating agency for
processing and may, after consultation with the originating agency,
inform the requester of the referral.
(f) Neutral response. In response to a request for information under
the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the
mandatory review provisions of ``the Order,'' NASA shall refuse to
confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of requested information
whenever the fact of its existence or non-existence is itself
classifiable under ``the Order.''
(g) Declassification of transferred documents or material--(1)
Material officially transferred. In the case of classified information
or material transferred by or pursuant to statute or Executive Order to
NASA in conjunction with a transfer of functions (not merely for storage
purposes) for NASA's use and as part of its official files or property,
as distinguished from transfers merely for purposes of storage, NASA
shall be deemed to be the original classifying authority over such
material for purposes of downgrading and declassification.
(2) Material not officially transferred. When NASA has in its
possession classified information or material originated by an agency
which has since ceased to exist and that information has not been
officially transferred to another department or agency or when it is
impossible for NASA to identify the originating agency and a review of
the material indicates that it should be downgraded or declassified,
NASA shall be deemed to be the originating agency for the purpose of
declassifying or downgrading such material. NASA will consult with the
Information Security Oversight Office to assist in final disposition of
the information.
(3) Transfer for storage or retirement. (i) Insofar as practicable,
classified documents shall be reviewed to determine whether or not they
can be downgraded or declassified prior to being forwarded to records
centers or to the National Archives for storage. Any downgrading or
declassification determination shall be indicated on each document by
appropriate markings.
(ii) Classified information transferred to the General Services
Administration for accession into the Archives of the United States
shall be downgraded or declassified by the Archivist of the United
States in accordance with ``the Order,'' the directives of the
Information Security Oversight Office, GSA, and NASA guidelines.
(h) Downgrading and declassification actions--(1) Notification of
changes in classification or declassification. When classified material
has been marked with specific dates or events for downgrading or
declassification, it is not necessary to issue notices of such actions
to any holders. However, when such actions are taken earlier than
originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is shortened,
the authority making such changes shall, to the extent practicable,
ensure prompt notification to all addressees to whom the information or
material was originally transmitted. The notification shall specify the
marking action to be taken, the authority therefor, and the effective
date. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall effect the proper
changes and shall notify addressees to whom they have transmitted the
classified information or material.
(2) Posted notice. If prompt remarking of large quantities would be
unduly burdensome, the custodian may attach declassification,
downgrading, or upgrading notices to the storage unit in lieu of the
remarking action otherwise required. Each notice shall indicate the
change, the authority for the action, the date of the action, and the
storage

[[Page 19]]

units to which it applies. Items withdrawn from such storage units shall
be promptly remarked. However, when information subject to a posted
downgrading or declassification notice is withdrawn from one storage
unit solely for transfer to another, or a storage unit containing such
information is transferred from one place to another, the transfer may
be made without remarking if the notice is attached to or remains with
each shipment.
(i) Foreign Relations Series. In order to permit the State
Department editors of Foreign Relations of the United States to meet
their mandated goal of publishing 20 years after the event, NASA shall
assist these editors by facilitating access to appropriate classified
materials in its custody and by expediting declassification review of
items from its files selected for publication.

Sec.  1203a.100  Purpose and scope.

(a) To insure the uninterrupted and successful accomplishment of the
NASA mission, certain designated security areas may be established and
maintained by NASA Centers and Component Facilities in order to provide
appropriate and adequate protection for facilities, property, or
classified/proprietary information and material in the possession of
NASA or NASA contractors located at NASA Centers and Component
Facilities.
(b) This part sets forth:
(1) The designation and maintenance of security areas,
(2) The responsibilities and procedures in connection therewith, and
(3) The penalties that may be enforced through court actions against
unauthorized persons entering security areas.

[38 FR 8056, Mar. 28, 1973, as amended at 78 FR 5123, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203a.101  Definitions.

For the purpose of this part, the following definitions apply:
(a) Security area. A physically defined area, established for the
protection or security of facilities, property, or classfied/proprietary
information and material in the possession of NASA or a NASA contractor
located at a NASA Center or Component Facility, entry to which is
subject to security measures, procedures, or controls. Security areas
which may be established are:
(1) Controlled area. An area in which security measures are taken to
safeguard and control access to property and hazardous materials or
other sensitive material or to protect operations that are vital to the
accomplishment of the mission assigned to a Center or Component
Facility. The controlled area shall have a clearly defined perimeter,
but permanent physical barriers are not required.
(2) Limited area. An area in which security measures are taken to
safeguard or control access to classified material or unclassified
property warranting special protection or property and hazardous
materials or to protect operations that are vital to the accomplishment
of the mission assigned to a Center or Component Facility. A Limited
Area shall also have a clearly defined perimeter, but differs from a
Controlled Area in that permanent physical barriers and access control
devices, including walls and doors with locks or access devices, are
emplaced to assist the occupants in keeping out unauthorized personnel.
All facilities designated as NASA Critical Infrastructure or a key
resource will be designated at a minimum as ``Limited'' areas.

[[Page 22]]

(3) Exclusion area. An area that is a permanent facility dedicated
solely to the safeguarding and use of Classified National Security
Information. It is used when vaults are unsuitable or impractical and
where entry to the area alone provides visible or audible access to
classified material. To prevent unauthorized access to an exclusion
area, visitors will be escorted or other internal restrictions
implemented, as determined by the Center Security Office.
(b) Temporary security area. A designated interim security area, the
need for which will not exceed 30 days from date of establishment. A
temporary security area may also be established, pending approval of its
establishment as a permanent security area.
(c) Permanent security area. A designated security area, the need
for which will exceed 30 days from date of establishment.

(a) Establishment. (1) Directors of NASA Centers, including
Component Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers, and the
Executive Director for Headquarters Operations at NASA Headquarters may
establish, maintain, and protect such areas designated as Controlled,
Limited, or Exclusion, depending upon their assessment of the potential
for unauthorized persons either to:
(i) Obtain knowledge of classified information,
(ii) Damage or remove property, or to
(iii) Disrupt NASA or NASA contractor operations.
(2) The concurrence of the Assistant Administrator for Protective
Services NASA Headquarters, shall be obtained prior to the establishment
of a permanent security area.
(3)(i) At a minimum, the following information will be submitted to
the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services 15 workdays prior to
establishment of each permanent security area:
(a) The name and specific location of the NASA Center or Component
Facility, or property to be protected.
(b) A statement that the property is owned by, or leased to, the
United States for use by NASA or is the property of a NASA contractor
located on a NASA Center or Component Facility.
(c) Designation desired: i.e., controlled, limited, or Exclusion.
(d) Specific purpose(s) for the establishment of a security area.
(ii) For those areas currently designated by the Center as
``permanent security areas,'' the information set forth in paragraph
(d)(3)(i) of this section will be furnished to the Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services , NASA Headquarters, within 30
workdays of the effective date of this part.
(b) Maintenance. The security measures which may be utilized to
protect such areas will be determined by the requirements of individual
situations. At a minimum, such security measures will:
(1) Provide for the posting of signs at entrances and at such
intervals along the perimeter of the designated area as to provide
reasonable notice to persons about to enter thereon. The Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services, NASA Headquarters, upon request,
may approve the use of signs that are now being used pursuant to a State
statute.
(2) Regulate authorized personnel entry and movement within the
area.
(3) Deny entry of unauthorized persons or property.
(4) Prevent unauthorized removal of classified information and
material or property from a NASA Center or Component Facility.
(c) Revocation. Once the need for an established permanent security
area no longer exists, the area will be returned immediately to normal
controls and procedures or as soon as practicable. The Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services will be informed of permanent
security area revocations within 15 workdays.

<r05>
Sec.  1203b.103  Arrest authority.

(a) NASA security force personnel may exercise arrest authority,
provided that:
(1) They have graduated from an accredited training course (see
Sec.  1203b.102(a)); and
(2) They have been certified in writing by the Assistant
Administrator for Protective Services, or designee, as specifically
authorized to exercise arrest authority.
(b) The authority of NASA security force personnel to make a
warrantless arrest is subject to the following conditions:
(1) The arresting officer must be guarding and protecting property
owned or leased by, or under the control of, the United States under the
administration and control of NASA or one of its contractors or
subcontractors, at facilities owned by or contracted to NASA; and
(2) The person to be arrested has committed in the arresting
officer's presence an offense against the United States Government,
NASA, or a NASA contractor; or
(3) The arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the
person to be arrested has committed or is committing any felony

<r05>
Sec.  1203b.104  Exercise of arrest authority--general guidelines.

(a) In making an arrest, the security force personnel should
announce their authority and that the person is under arrest prior to
taking the person into custody. If the circumstances are such that
making such an announcement would be useless or dangerous to the
security force personnel or others, the security force personnel may
dispense with these announcements, but must subsequently identify
themselves and their arrest authority to the arrested person(s) as soon
as reasonably possible.
(b) The security force personnel at the time and place of arrest may
search the arrested person and the area immediately surrounding the
arrested person for weapons and criminal evidence. This is to protect
the arresting officer and to prevent the destruction of evidence.
(c) Custody of the person arrested should be transferred to other
Federal law enforcement personnel (e.g., United States Marshals or FBI
agents) or to local law enforcement agency personnel, as appropriate, as
soon as possible, in order to ensure the person is brought before a
magistrate without unnecessary delay.

[57 FR 4926, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 78 FR 5125, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203b.105  Use of non-deadly physical force when making an arrest.

When a security force personnel has the right to make an arrest, as
discussed in Sec.  1203b.103, the officer may use only that non-deadly
physical force which is reasonable and necessary to apprehend and arrest
the offender; to

[[Page 25]]

prevent the escape of the offender; or to defend himself/herself or a
third person from what the security force officer reasonably believes to
be the use or threat of imminent use of non-deadly physical force by the
offender. Verbal abuse alone by the offender cannot be the basis under
any circumstances for use of non-deadly physical force by a security
force officer.

[57 FR 4926, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 78 FR 5125, Jan. 24, 2013]


<r05>
Sec.  1203b.106  Use of deadly force.

NASA security force personnel may use deadly force only when
necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the
subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious
physical injury to the officer or to another person.
(a) Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a
fleeing suspect.
(b) Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles.
(c) If feasible and if to do so would not increase the danger to the
officer or others, a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the
officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force.
(d) Warning shots are not permitted outside of the prison context.
(e) Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for
handling resisting subjects which must be used when the use of deadly
force is not authorized by this policy.

personnel shall comply with the following precautions whenever possible:
(1) Give an order to halt or desist before firing.
(2) Do not fire if shots are likely to harm innocent bystanders.
(3) Shoot to stop.
(b) Warning shots are not authorized.

who, in turn, will report it to the NASA Assistant Administrator for
Protective Services as expeditiously as possible, with as many details
supplied as are available.
(2) The officer shall be promptly suspended from duty with pay or
reassigned to other duties not involving the use of a firearm, as the
Center Director or the Assistant Administrator for Protective Services
deems appropriate, pending investigation of the incident.
(3) The cognizant Center Director, or for incidents occurring at
NASA Headquarters, the Executive Director for Headquarters Operations,
shall appoint an investigating officer to conduct a thorough
investigation of the incident. Additional personnel may also be
appointed, as needed to assist the investigating officer. Upon
conclusion of the investigation, the investigating officer shall submit
a written report of findings and recommendations to the appropriate
Installation Director or the Assistant Administrator for Protective
Services.

<r05>
Sec.  1203b.108  Management oversight.

(a) The Administrator shall establish a committee to exercise
management

[[Page 26]]

oversight over the implementation of arrest authority.
(b) The Administrator shall establish a reporting requirement for
NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers.

Sec.  1204.400  Scope of subpart.

This subpart establishes NASA's small business policy and outlines
the delegation of authority in implementing this policy as required by
Federal law.


<r05>
Sec.  1204.401  Policy.

(a) It is NASA's policy to enable small businesses (including small
disadvantaged businesses, small women-owned businesses, HUBZone small
businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service disabled veteran-
owned small businesses), historically black colleges and universities,
and other minority educational institutions the opportunity to
participate equitably and proportionately in its total purchases and
contracts that are consistent with the Agency's needs to execute its
mission.
(b) In carrying out the NASA procurement program, the primary
consideration shall be that of securing contract performance, including
obtaining deliveries of required items or services at the time, in the
quantity and of the quality prescribed. In the area of research and
development (R&amp;D) contracts, the general policy of NASA is to award such
contracts to those organizations determined by responsible personnel to
have a high degree of competence in the specific branch of science or
technology required for the successful conduct of the work. It is in the
interest of the civilian space program that the number of firms engaged
inR&amp;D, work for NASA be expanded and that there be an increase in the
extent of participation in such work by competent small business firms.

the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) along with the Associate Administrator
for the Office of Small Business Programs shall nominate a qualified
individual in their contracting office as a small business specialist to
provide a central point of contact to which small business concerns may
direct inquiries concerning small business matters and participation in
NASA acquisitions. When a Center Director determines that the volume of
acquisitions or the functions relating to acquisitions at the Center do
not warrant a full-time small business specialist, these duties may be
assigned to procurement personnel on a part-time basis, with the
concurrence of the Associate Administrator for the Office of Small
Business Programs. NASA Centers shall establish and maintain liaison
with the Small Business Administration (SBA) Procurement Center
Representative (PCR) or the appropriate SBA Regional Office in matters
relating to NASA Center procurement activities. Small Business

Government that result from the emergency landing. No landing fee will
be charged, but the charges will include the labor, materials, parts,
use of equipment, and tools required for any service rendered under
these circumstances.
(d) In addition to any report required by the Federal Aviation
Administration, a complete report covering the landing and the emergency
will be filed with the airfield manager by the pilot or, if the pilot is
not available, any other crew member or passenger.
(e) Before an aircraft which has made an emergency landing is
permitted to take off (if the aircraft can and is to be flown out) the
owner or operator thereof shall make arrangements acceptable to the
approving authority to pay any charges assessed for services rendered
and execute a Hold Harmless Agreement. The owner or operator may also be
required to furnish a certificate of insurance, as provided in Sec.
1204.1404, covering such takeoff.


<r05>
Sec.  1204.1407  Procedure in the event of an unauthorized use.

Any aircraft not operated for benefit of the Federal Government
which lands at a NASA airfield facility without obtaining prior
permission from the approving authority, except in a bona fide
emergency, is in violation of this subpart. Such aircraft will
experience delays while authorization for departure is obtained pursuant
to this subpart and may, contrary to the other provisions of this
subpart, be required, at the discretion of the approving authority, to
pay a user fee of not less than $100. Before the aircraft is permitted
to depart, the approving authority will require full compliance with
this subpart 1204.14, including the filing of a complete report
explaining the reasons for the unauthorized landing. Violators could
also be subject to legal liability for unauthorized use. When it appears
that the violation of this subpart was deliberate or is a repeated
violation, the matter will be referred to the Aircraft Management
Office, NASA Headquarters, which will then grant any departure
authorization.

point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local
officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.
(c) If a state has not established a process, or is unable to submit
a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional and local
officals and entities may submit comments to the Agency.
(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process,
state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit
comments to the Agency. In addition, if a state process recommendation
for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to the Agency by
the single point of contact, the Administrator follows the procedures of
Sec.  1204.1510 of this part.
(e) The Administrator considers comments which do not constitute a
state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for
which the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of Sec.
1204.1510 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single
point of contact, or directly to the Agency by a commenting party.

(2) Reaches a mutally agreeable solution with the state process; or
(3) Provides the single point of contact with a written explanation
of its decision, in such form as the Administrator in his or her
discretion deems appropriate. The Administrator may also supplement the
written explanation by providing the explanation to the single point of
contact by telephone, other telecommunication, or other means.
(b) In any explanation under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the
Administrator informs the single point of contact that:
(1) The Agency will not implement its decision for a least ten days
after the single point of contact receives the explanation; or
(2) The Administrator has reviewed the decision and determined that,
because of unusual circumstances, the waiting period of at least ten
days is not feasible.

<r05>
Sec.  1204.1600  Issuance of motor vehicle for home-to-work.

When a NASA employee on temporary duty travel is authorized to
travel by Government motor vehicle and the official authorizing the
travel determines that there will be a significant savings in time, a
Government motor vehicle may be issued at the close of the preceding
working day and taken to the employee's residence prior to the
commencement of official travel. Similarly, when a NASA employee is
scheduled to return from temporary duty travel after the close of
working hours and the official authorizing the travel determines that
there will be a significant savings in time, the motor vehicle may be
taken to the employee's residence and returned the next regular working
day.

<r05>
Sec. Appendix A to Part 1204--Items To Cover in Memoranda of Agreement

The items to be covered in Memoranda of Agreement between NASA
Installations and state and areawide OMB Circular A-95 clearinghouses
for coordinating NASA and civilian planning:
1. Clearinghouses will be contacted at the earliest practicable
point in project planning. Generally, this will be during the
preparation of Preliminary Engineering Reports, or possibly earlier if
meaningful information is available that could practically serve as an
input in the decision-making process. It should be noted that
clearinghouses are generally comprehensive planning agencies. As such,
they are often the best repositories of information required for
development planning and constitute a resource that can often save
Federal planners substantial time and effort, if consulted early enough.
In addition to providing information necessary for preliminary
engineering, clearinghouses can make useful inputs to the development of
environmental impact statements, as well as in reviewing draft
statements. Thus, consultation at the earliest stage in planning can
have substantial payoffs in installation development.
2. Clearinghouses will be afforded a minimum time of 30 days in
which to review and comment on a proposed project and a maximum time of
45 days in which to complete such review.
3. The minimum information to be provided to the clearinghouse will
consist of project description, scope and purpose, summary technical
data, maps and diagrams where relevant, and any data which would show
the relationship of the proposed project or action to applicable land
use plans, policies, and controls for the affected area.
4. Establish procedures for notifying clearinghouses of the actions
taken on projects, such as implementation, timing, postponement,
abandonment, and explaining, where appropriate, actions taken contrary
to clearinghouse recommendations.

<r04>
Subpart A_Basic Policy


<r05>
Sec.  1206.100  Scope.

This part 1206 establishes the policies, responsibilities, and
procedures for the release of Agency records which are under the
jurisdiction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
hereinafter NASA, to members of the public. This part applies to
information and Agency records located at NASA Headquarters, and NASA
Centers, including Component Facilities and Technical and Service
Support Centers, herein NASA Headquarters and Centers, as defined in
this part.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.101  General policy.

(a) In compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as
amended 5 U.S.C. 552, a positive and continuing obligation exists for
NASA, herein Agency, to make available to the fullest extent practicable
upon request by members of the public, all Agency records under its
jurisdiction, as described in this regulation.
(b) Part 1206 does not entitle any person to any service or to the
disclosure of any record that is not required under the FOIA.
(c) The disclosure of exempt records, without authorization by the
appropriate NASA official, is not an official release of information;
accordingly, it is not a FOIA release. Such a release does not waive the
authority of NASA to assert FOIA exemptions to withhold the same records
in response to a FOIA request. In addition, while the authority may
exist to disclose records to individuals in their official capacity, the
provisions of this part apply if the same individual seeks the records
in a private or personal capacity.

<r04>
Subpart B_Types of Records To Be Made Available


<r05>
Sec.  1206.200  Publishing of records.

(a) Records required to be published in the Federal Register. The
following records are required to be published in the Federal Register,
for codification in Title 14, Chapter V, of the CFR.

[[Page 44]]

(1) Description of NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers and the
established places at which, the employees from whom, and the methods
whereby, the public may secure information, make submittals or requests,
or obtain decisions;
(2) Statements of the general course and method by which NASA's
functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and
requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;
(3) Rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the
places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions regarding the
scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;
(4) Substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized
by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general
applicability formulated and adopted by NASA;
(5) Each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing.
(b) Agency opinions, orders, statements, and manuals. (1) Unless
they are exempt from disclosure in accordance with the FOIA, or unless
they are promptly published and copies offered for sale, NASA shall make
available the following records for public inspection in an electronic
format or purchase:
(i) All final opinions (including concurring and dissenting
opinions) and all orders made in the adjudication of cases;
(ii) Those statements of NASA policy and interpretations which have
been adopted by NASA and are not published in the Federal Register;
(iii) Administrative staff manuals (or similar issuances) and
instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;
(iv) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have
been released to any person under Subpart C of this part and that,
because of the nature of their subject matter, the Agency determines
have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests
for substantially the same records (frequently requested documents or
documents that have been requested 3 or more times).
(2) A general index of records referred to under paragraph
(b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(i) For records created after November 1, 1996, which are covered by
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, such records shall be
available electronically, through an electronic library and in
electronic forms or formats.
(ii) In connection with all records required to be made available or
published under this paragraph (b), identifying details shall be deleted
to the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy. However, in each case, the justification for the
deletion shall be explained fully in writing. The extent of such
deletion shall be indicated on the portion of the record which is made
available or published, unless including that indication would harm an
interest protected by an exemption in the FOIA. If technically feasible,
the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record
where the deletion is made.
(c) Other Agency records. (1) In addition to the records made
available or published under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,
NASA shall, upon request for other records made in accordance with this
part, make such records promptly available to any person, unless they
are exempt from disclosure, or unless they may be purchased by the
public from other readily available sources, i.e., books.
(2) Furthermore, at a minimum, NASA will maintain records in its
electronic library that were created after November 1, 1996, under
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and a guide for requesting records
or information from NASA.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.201  Proactive disclosure of Agency records.

Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for
public inspection and copying in an electronic format are accessible on
the Agency's Web site, http://www.nasa.gov. Each Center is responsible
for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly
available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the
public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting such
records. Each Center has a FOIA

<r05>
Sec.  1206.202  Records that have been published.

Publication in the Federal Register is a means of making certain
Agency records are available to the public in accordance with 5
U.S.C.552(a)(2) without requiring the filing of a FOIA request. NASA has
a FOIA Electronic Library Web site at NASA Headquarters and each of its
Centers. The FedBizOpps (FBO) (formerly Commerce Business Daily), is
also a source of information concerning Agency records or actions.
Various other NASA publications and documents, and indexes thereto, are
available from other sources, such as the U.S. Superintendent of
Documents and the Earth Resources Observation and Science Center
(Department of the Interior). Such publications and documents are not
required to be made available or reproduced in response to a request
unless they cannot be purchased readily from available sources.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.203  Incorporation by reference.

Records reasonably available to the members of the public affected
thereby shall be deemed published in the Federal Register when
incorporated by reference in material published in the Federal Register
(pursuant to the Federal Register regulation on incorporation by
reference, 1 CFR Part 51).


<r04>
Subpart C_Procedures


<r05>
Sec.  1206.300  How to make a request for Agency records.

(a) A requester submitting a request for records must include his/
her name, and an email or mailing address in order for the Agency to be
able to send responsive records and/or to be able to contact the
requester to obtain additional information or clarification of the
request sought (see Sec.  1206.301). The request must also address fees
or provide justification for a fee waiver (see Sec.  1206.302) as well
as address the fee category in accordance with Sec.  1206.507. The
request should also include a telephone number in case the FOIA office
needs to contact the requester regarding the request; however, this
information is optional when submitting a request if an email or mailing
address is provided. A requester may also submit a request online via
the NASA FOIA website, https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/Contacts.html. Do not
include a social security number on any correspondence with the FOIA
office. If the FOIA unit determines processing fees will exceed the fee
category entitlement, the unit will require a personal mailing address
for billing purposes or for commercial use requesters, a business
mailing address.
(b) NASA does not have a central location for submitting FOIA
requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records
in its possession. Instead, Agency records are decentralized and
maintained by various Centers and offices throughout the country. All
NASA Centers have the capability to receive requests electronically,
either through email or a Web portal. To make a request for any of the
NASA Center records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA
office of the Center that maintains the records being sought. A request
will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the
FOIA office of the Center that maintains the records requested. If a
requester does not know which Center(s) may have the requested records,
he/she may send his/her request(s) to the NASA's Headquarters (HQ) FOIA
Public Liaison, 300 E Street SW, Room 5L19, Washington, DC 20546, Fax
number: (202) 358-4332, email address: <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1078613d767f7971507e7163713e777f66">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, and the HQ FOIA
unit will forward the request to the Center(s) that it determines to be
most likely to maintain the records that are sought.
(c) NASA has not yet implemented a records management application
for automated capture and control of e-records; therefore, official
files are primarily paper files.
(d) A member of the public may submit a FOIA request for an Agency
record by mail, facsimile (FAX), electronic mail (email), or by
submitting a

[[Page 46]]

written request in person to the FOIA office having responsibility over
the record requested or to the NASA Headquarters (HQ) FOIA Office. A
requester may also submit a request online via the NASA FOIA website.
(e) When a requester is unable to determine the proper NASA FOIA
Office to direct a request to, the requester may send the request to the
NASA HQ FOIA Office, 300 E. Street SW., Washington, DC 20546-0001. The
HQ FOIA Office will forward the request to the Center(s) that it
determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.
(1) For locations, mailing/email addresses of NASA FOIA Centers,
visit our website at https://www.nasa.gov/FOIA/Contacts.html.
(2) A misdirected request may take up to ten (10) additional working
(meaning all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal legal
holidays) days to reroute to the proper FOIA office.
(f) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or
herself (a Privacy Act request) must comply with the verification of
identity provisions set forth in 14 CFR 1212.202.
(g) Where a request pertains to a third party, a requester may
receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization
signed by the individual who is the subject of the record requested, or
a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the
requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the
records to the requester, or submit proof that the individual is
deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or a verifiable obituary).
(h) As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each Center
FOIA office may require a requester to supply additional information if
necessary, i.e., a notarized statement from the subject of the file, in
order to verify that a particular individual has consented to a third
party disclosure. Information will only be released on a case-by-case
basis to third party requesters if they have independently provided
authorization from the individual who is the subject of the request.

Oct. 11, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  1206.301  Describing records sought.

In view of the time limits under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) for an initial
determination on a request for an Agency record, a request must meet the
following requirements:
(a) The request must be addressed to an appropriate FOIA office or
otherwise be clearly identified in the letter as a request for an Agency
record under the ``Freedom of Information Act.''
(b) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail
to enable Agency personnel who are familiar with the subject area of the
request to identify and locate the record with a reasonable amount of
effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific
information that may assist a FOIA office in identifying the requested
records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject
matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference
number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible
about the specific records or the types of records sought.
(c) If NASA, after receiving a request, determines that the request
does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the
requester what additional information is needed or why the request is
otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or
modify such a request may discuss their request with the NASA's
designated FOIA contact or the Principal Agency FOIA Officer, each of
whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the
records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records
sought, the Agency's response to the request may be delayed or NASA may
at its discretion close the request administratively.
(d) Requests for clarification or more information will be made in
writing (either via U.S. mail or electronic mail whenever possible).
Requesters may respond by U.S. mail or by electronic mail regardless of
the method used by

[[Page 47]]

NASA to transmit the request for additional information. In order to be
considered timely, responses to requests for additional information must
be postmarked or received by electronic mail within twenty (20) working
days of the postmark date or date of the electronic mail request for
additional information or received by electronic mail by 11:59:59 p.m.
ET on the 20th working day. If the requester does not respond to a
request for additional information within the 20 working days, the
request may be administratively closed at NASA's discretion. This
administrative closure does not prejudice the requester's ability to
submit a new request for further consideration with additional
information.
(e) NASA need not comply with a blanket or categorical request (such
as ``all matters relating to'' a general subject) where it is not
reasonably feasible to determine what record is sought.
(f) NASA will in good faith attempt to identify and locate the
record(s) sought and will consult with the requester when necessary and
appropriate for that purpose in accordance with these regulations.
(g) NASA is not required to create or compile records in response to
a FOIA request.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.302  Fee agreements.

(a) A request must explicitly state a willingness to pay all fees
associated with processing the request, fees up to a specified amount,
or a request for a fee waiver, if processing fees will likely exceed the
statutory entitlements as defined in Sec.  1206.507(b) and (c).
(b) If the FOIA office determines that fees for processing the
request will exceed the agreed upon amount or the statutory
entitlements, the FOIA office will notify the requester that:
(1) He/she must provide assurance of payment for all anticipated
fees or provide an advance payment if estimated fees are expected to
exceed $250.00, or
(2) The FOIA office will not be able to fully comply with the FOIA
request unless an assurance or advance payment as requested has been
provided.
(3) He/she may wish to limit the scope of the request to reduce the
processing fees.
(c) If the FOIA office does not receive a written response within 20
working days after requesting the information, it will presume the
requester is no longer interested in the records requested and will
administratively close the request without further notification.
(d) A commercial-use requester (as defined inSec.  1206.507(c)(1))
must:
(1) State a willingness to pay all fess associated with processing a
request; or
(2) State a willingness to pay fees to cover the costs of conducting
an initial search for responsive records to determine a fee estimate.
(e) If a requester is only willing to pay a limited amount for
processing a request and it is for more than one document, the requester
must state the order in which he/she would like the request for records
to be processed.
(f) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, the request must include
sufficient justification to substantiate a waiver. (See subpart E of
this part for information on fee waivers.) Failure to provide sufficient
justification will result in a denial of the fee waiver request.
(g) If a requester is seeking a fee waiver, he/she may also choose
to state a willingness to pay fees in case the fee waiver request is
denied in order to allow the FOIA office to begin processing the request
while considering the fee waiver.
(h) If a fee is chargeable for search, review, duplication, or other
costs incurred in connection with a request for an Agency record, the
requester will be billed prior to releasing Agency documents. If the
total amount of processing fees is under $50.00, the Agency will release
the records when final processing is complete.
(1) If the exact amount of the fee chargeable is not known at the
time of the request, the requester will be notified in the initial
determination (or in a final determination in the case of an appeal) of
the amount of fees chargeable.
(2) For circumstances in which advance payment of fees is required,
the

[[Page 48]]

requester will be notified after the FOIA office has obtained an
estimate of associated fees.
(i) The FOIA office will begin processing a request only after the
request has been properly described in accordance with these regulations
and fees have been resolved.
(j) If the requester is required to pay a fee and it is later
determined on appeal that he/she was entitled to a full or partial fee
waiver, a refund will be sent as appropriate.
(k) NASA may refuse to consider a waiver or reduction of fees for
requesters (persons or organizations) from whom unpaid fees remain owed
to the Agency for another information access request.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.303  Format of records disclosed.

(a) The FOIA office will provide the records in the requested format
if the records can readily be reproduced from the original file to that
specific format.
(b) The FOIA office may charge direct costs associated with
converting the records or files into the requested format if they are
not maintained in that format. If the costs to convert the records
exceed the amount the requester has agreed to pay, the FOIA office will
notify the requester in writing. If the requester does not agree to pay
the additional fees for converting the records, the records may not be
provided in the requested format.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.304  Expedited processing.

A requester may ask for expedited processing of a request. However,
information to substantiate the request must be included in accordance
with Sec.  1206.400, Criteria for Expedited Processing; otherwise, the
request for expedited processing will be denied and processed in the
simple or complex queue.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.305  Responding to requests.

(a) Except in the instances described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of
this section, the FOIA office that first receives a request for a record
and maintains that record is the FOIA office responsible for responding
to the request. The office shall acknowledge the request and assign it
an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than ten (10)
working days to process. The NASA office responding to the request shall
include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought
to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.
(b) In determining what records are responsive to a request, a FOIA
office ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the
date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the FOIA
office shall inform the requester of that date.
(c) A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1)-(3), shall not be considered responsive
to a request.
(d) The Head of a Center, or designee, is authorized to grant or to
deny any requests for records that are maintained by that Center.
(e) The FOIA office may refer a request to or consult with another
Center FOIA office or Federal agency in accordance with Sec.  1206.308,
if the FOIA office receives a request for records that are in its
possession that were not created at that Center. If another Center
within NASA or another Federal agency has substantial interest in or
created the records, the request will either be referred or they will
consult with that FOIA office/agency.
(f) If a request for an Agency record is received by a FOIA office
not having responsibility of the record (for example, when a request is
submitted to one NASA Center or Headquarters and another NASA Center has
responsibility of the record), the FOIA office receiving the request
shall promptly forward it to that FOIA office within 10 working days
from the date of receipt. The receiving FOIA office shall acknowledge
the request and provide the requester with a tracking number.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.306  Granting a request.

(a) Ordinarily, NASA shall have twenty (20) working days from when a
request is received to determine whether to grant or deny the request
unless there are unusual or exceptional circumstances. The FOIA office
will not

[[Page 49]]

begin processing a request until all issues regarding scope and fees
have been resolved. NASA will notify the requester of the availability
of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance in resolving these
issues.
(b) If fees are not expected to exceed the minimum threshold of
$50.00, and the scope of the request is in accordance with Sec.
1206.301, the FOIA office will begin processing the request.
(c) If the FOIA office contacts the requester regarding fees or
clarification and the requester has provided a response, the FOIA office
will notify the requester in writing of the decision to either grant or
deny the request.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.307  Denying a request.

NASA shall withhold records only when it reasonably foresees that
disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption or
disclosure is prohibited by law.
(a) If the FOIA office denies records in response to a request
either in full or in part, it will advise the requester in writing that:
(1) The requested record(s) is exempt in full or in part; or
(2) Records do not exist, cannot be located, are not in the Agency's
control, or the request does not reasonably describe the records sought;
or
(3) A record is not readily reproducible in the form or format
requested; and or
(4) Denial is based on a procedural issue only and not access to the
underlying records when it makes a decision that:
(i) A fee waiver or another fee-related issue will not be granted;
or
(ii) Expedited processing will not be provided.
(b) The denial notification must include:
(1) The name, title, or position of the person(s) responsible for
the denial;
(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including a
reference to any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the FOIA office to
withhold records in full or in part;
(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information
withheld, i.e., the number of pages or a reasonable form of estimation,
unless such an estimate would harm an interest protected by the
exemption(s) used to withhold the records or information; and
(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart G of
this part and a description of the requirements set forth therein. NASA
shall also inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public
Liaison to offer assistance and include a statement notifying the
requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of
Government Information Services (OGIS). Should the requester elect to
mediate any dispute related to the FOIA request with OGIS, NASA will
participate in the mediation process in good faith.
(c) If the requested records contain both exempt and non-exempt
material, the FOIA office will:
(1) Segregate and release the non-exempt material unless the non-
exempt material is so intertwined with the exempt material that
disclosure of it would leave only meaningless words and phrases;
(2) Indicate on the released portion(s) of the records the amount of
information redacted and the FOIA exemption(s) under which the redaction
was made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the FOIA
exemption used to withhold the information; and
(3) If technically feasible, place the exemption at the place of
excision.

[79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54775,
Oct. 11, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  1206.308  Referrals and consultations within NASA or other
Federal Agencies.

(a) Referrals and consultations can occur within the Agency or
outside the Agency.
(b) If a FOIA office (other than the Office of Inspector General)
receives a request for records in its possession that another NASA FOIA
office has responsibility over or is substantially concerned with, it
will either:
(1) Consult with the other FOIA office before deciding whether to
release or withhold the records; or
(2) Refer the request, along with the records, to that FOIA office
for direct response.

[[Page 50]]

(c) If the FOIA office that originally received the request refers
all or part of the request to another FOIA office within the Agency for
further processing, they will notify the requester of the partial
referral and provide that FOIA contact information.
(d) If while responding to a request, the FOIA office locates
records that originated with another Federal agency, it will generally
refer the request and any responsive records to that other agency for a
release determination and direct response.
(e) If the FOIA office refers all the records to another agency, it
will document the referral and maintain a copy of the records that it
refers; notify the requester of the referral in writing, unless that
identification will itself disclose a sensitive, exempt fact; and will
provide the contact information for the other agency and if known, the
name of a contact at the other agency.
(f) If the FOIA office locates records that originated with another
Federal agency while responding to a request, the office will make the
release determination itself (after consulting with the originating
agency) when:
(1) The record is of primary interest to NASA (for example, a record
may be of primary interest to NASA if it was developed or prepared
according to Agency regulations or directives, or in response to an
Agency request); or
(2) NASA is in a better position than the originating agency to
assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure; or
(3) The originating agency is not subject to the FOIA; or
(4) It is more efficient or practical depending on the
circumstances.
(g) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that another
Federal agency has classified under any applicable executive order
concerning record classification, it must refer the request to that
agency for response.
(h) If the FOIA office receives a request for records that are under
the purview of another Federal agency, the office will return the
request to the requester and may advise the requester to submit it
directly to another agency. The FOIA office will then close the request.
(i) All consultations and referrals received by the Agency will be
handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was
received by the first FOIA office.


<r04>
Subpart D_Procedures and Time Limits for Responding to Requests


<r05>
Sec.  1206.400  Procedures for processing queues and expedited processing.

(a) The FOIA office will normally process requests in the order in
which they are received in each of the processing tracks.
(b) FOIA offices use three queues for multi-track processing
depending on the complexity of the request. Once it has been determined
the request meets the criteria in accordance with subpart C of this
part, the FOIA office will place the request in one of the following
tracks:
(1) Simple--A request that can be processed within 20 working days.
(2) Complex--A request that will take over 20 working days to
process. (A complex request will generally require coordination with
more than one office and a legal 10 working day extension for unusual
circumstances (see Sec.  1206.403) may be taken either up front or
during the first 20 days of processing the request.)
(3) Expedited processing--A request for expedited processing will be
processed in this track if the requester can show exceptional need or
urgency that their request should be processed out of turn in accordance
with paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis
whenever it is determined that they involve one or more of the
following:
(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or
physical safety of an individual;
(2) Circumstances in which there is an urgency to inform the public
about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity if the FOIA
request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating
information;
(i) In most situations, a person primarily engaged in disseminating
information will be a representative of the

[[Page 51]]

news media and therefore, will qualify as a person primarily engaged in
disseminating information.
(ii) To substantiate paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the requested
information must be the type of information which has particular value
that will be lost if not disseminated quickly; this ordinarily refers to
a breaking news story of general public interest. Information of
historical interest only or information sought for litigation or
commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media deadline
unrelated to breaking news; or
(3) The loss of substantial due process rights.
(d) A request for expedited processing must contain a statement
that:
(1) Explains in detail how the request meets one or more of the
criteria in paragraph (c) of this section; and
(2) Certifies that the explanation is true and correct to the best
of the requester's knowledge and belief.
(3) If the request is made referencing paragraph (c)(2) of this
section, the requester must substantiate the public interest.
(e) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time.
Requests must be submitted to the FOIA office responsible for processing
the requested records.
(f) The FOIA office must notify the requester of its decision to
grant or deny expedited processing within 10 calendar days from the date
of receipt.
(g) If expedited processing is granted, the request will be
processed on a first-in, first-out basis in that queue.
(h) If expedited processing is denied, the FOIA office will notify
the requester and provide information on appealing this decision in
accordance with Subpart G of this part and place the request in the
appropriate processing queue.
(i) If the FOIA office processing the request does not provide
notification of either granting or denying the request for expedited
processing within 10 calendar days from the date of receipt, the
requester may file an appeal for non-response in accordance with subpart
G of this part.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.401  Procedures and time limits for acknowledgement letters
and initial determinations.

(a) Following receipt of a request submitted under the FOIA, the
FOIA staff will send an acknowledgement letter providing the case
tracking number and processing track within ten (10) working days from
date of receipt to the requester.
(b) An initial determination is a decision by a NASA official, in
response to a request by a member of the public for an Agency record, on
whether the record described in the request can be identified and
located after a reasonable search and, if so, whether the record (or
portions thereof) will be made available under this part or will be
withheld from disclosure under the FOIA.
(c) An initial determination on a request for an Agency record
addressed in accordance with this regulation (to include one submitted
in person at a FOIA office) shall be made (for example, to grant,
partially grant or deny a request), and the requester shall be sent an
initial determination letter within 20 working days after receipt of the
request, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (unless unusual circumstances
exist as defined in Sec.  1206.403).
(d) The basic time limit for a misdirected FOIA request (not a
referral or consultation) begins on the date on which the request is
first received by the appropriate FOIA office within the Agency, but in
any event no later than ten (10) working days after the date the request
is first received by a FOIA office designated to receive FOIA requests.
(e) Any notification of an initial determination that does not
comply fully with the request for an Agency record, including those
searches that produce no responsive documents, shall include a statement
of the reasons for the adverse determination, include the name and title
of the person making the initial determination, and notify the requester
of the right to appeal to the Administrator or the Inspector General, as
appropriate, pursuant to subpart G of this part, and the right to seek
dispute resolution services from

[[Page 52]]

the NASA FOIA Public Liaison or Office of Government Information
Services.

[79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54776,
Oct. 11, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  1206.402  Suspending the basic time limit.

(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(I), the FOIA office
may make one request to the requester for information to clarify a
request and temporarily suspend (toll) the time (the 20-day period)
while it is awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested
from the requester. Receipt of the requester's response by the FOIA
office to the Agency's request for additional information or
clarification ends the temporary time suspension.
(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii)(II), the FOIA
office may temporarily suspend (toll) the 20-day period as many times as
is necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fees.
Receipt of the requester's response by the FOIA office to the Agency's
request for information regarding fees ends the temporary time
suspension.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.403  Time extensions.

(a) In ``unusual circumstances'' as defined in this section, the
time limits for an initial determination and for a final determination
may be extended, but not to exceed a total of 10 working days in the
aggregate in the processing of any specific request for an Agency
record. The extension must be taken before the expiration of the 20
working day time limits. The requester will be notified in writing of:
(1) The unusual circumstances surrounding the extension of the time
limit;
(2) The date by which the FOIA office expects to complete the
processing of the request.
(b) Unusual circumstances are defined as:
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from
offices other than the office processing the request;
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a
voluminous number of documents;
(3) The need to coordinate and/or consult with another NASA office
or agency having a substantial subject-matter interest in the
determination of the request.
(c) If initial processing time will exceed or is expected to exceed
30 working days, the FOIA office will notify the requester of the delay
in processing and:
(1) Provide the opportunity to limit the scope of the request so
that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to
arrange with the Agency an alternative time frame for processing the
request or a modified request;
(2) Provide contact information for the NASA FOIA Public Liaison;
(3) Offer the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution
services from the OGIS;
(4) Provide information regarding the intended determination; and
(5) Shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA
Public Liaison for the purpose of this paragraph (c).
(d) The requester's refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a
request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing a request
after being given the opportunity to do so may be considered a factor
when determining whether exceptional circumstances exist. A delay that
results from a predictable workload of requests does not constitute
exceptional circumstances unless the Agency demonstrates reasonable
progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.

<r04>
Subpart E_Fees Associated With Processing Requests


<r05>
Sec.  1206.500  Search.

(a) Search includes all time spent looking for material that is
responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line
identification of material within documents. A search will determine
what specific documents, if any, are responsive to a request. A search
for Agency records responsive to a request may be accomplished by manual
or automated means.

[[Page 53]]

(b) Search charges, as set forth in this part, may be billed even
when an Agency record, which has been requested, cannot be identified or
located after a diligent search and consultation with a professional
NASA employee familiar with the subject area of the request has been
conducted or if located, cannot be made available under Sec.  1206.308.
(c) In responding to FOIA requests, FOIA offices shall charge the
following fees based on the date the request is received in the NASA
FOIA Office unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under
Sec.  1206.506. Fees will be determined on October 1st of each year
based on the appropriate General Schedule (GS) base salary, plus the
District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits of
employees. Fees such as search, review, and duplication will be charged
in accordance with the requester's fee category as defined in Sec.
1206.507.
(d) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested
records, including electronic searches that do not require new
programming, the fees will be the average hourly GS-base salary, plus
the District of Columbia locality payment, plus 16 percent for benefits
of employees in the following three categories, as applicable:
(1) Clerical--Based on a GS-6, Step 5 (all employees at a GS-7 and
below are classified as clerical for this purpose).
(2) Professional--Based on a GS-11, Step 7 pay (all employees at a
GS-8 through GS-12 are classified as professional for this purpose);
(3) Managerial--Based on GS-14, Step 2, pay (all employees at a GS-
13 and above are classified as managerial for this purpose).
(e) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with
conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to
locate the requested records.
(f) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an
agency at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, additional
costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate
Schedule established by NARA.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.501  Review.

(a) Review means the process of examining a document(s) located in
response to a request to determine whether the document(s) or any
portion thereof is disclosable. Review does not include time spent
resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of
exemptions.
(b) Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial
review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by Agency staff to
determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion
of a record.
(c) Review fees will be charged to commercial use requesters.
(d) No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal
stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, when
the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer
applies, any costs associated with an additional review of the records
in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as
review fees.
(e) Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged
for a search under Sec.  1206.500.
(f) Review fees can be charged even if the record(s) reviewed
ultimately is not disclosed.
(g) Review fees will not include costs incurred in resolving issues
of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a
request under this section.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.502  Duplication.

(a) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the
information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request.
Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic
records, among others.
(b) FOIA offices shall honor a requester's preference for receiving
a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible
by the FOIA office in the form or format requested. If the records are
not readily reproducible in the requested form or format, the Agency
will so inform the requester. The requester may specify an alternative
form or format that is

[[Page 54]]

available. If in this situation the requester refuses to specify an
alternative form or format, the Agency will not process the request any
further.
(c) Where standard-sized photocopies or scans are supplied, the FOIA
office will provide one copy per request at the regular copy rate per
page.
(d) For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other
electronic media, FOIA offices will charge the direct costs of producing
the copy in the form or format requested, including the time spent by
personnel duplicating the requested records. For each quarter hour spent
by personnel duplicating the requested records, the fees will be the
same as those charged for a search under this subpart.
(e) If NASA staff must scan paper documents in order to accommodate
a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format,
the requester shall pay the appropriate copy fee charge per page as well
as each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records.
Fees will be the same as those charged for search under this subpart for
each quarter hour spent by personnel scanning the requested records.
(f) For other forms of duplication, FOIA offices will charge the
direct costs as well as any associated personnel costs. For standard-
sized copies of documents such as letters, memoranda, statements,
reports, contracts, etc., $0.15 per copy of each page; charges for
double-sided copies will be $0.30. For copies of oversized documents,
such as maps, charts, etc., fees will be assessed as direct costs.
Charges for copies (and scanning) include the time spent in duplicating
the documents. For copies of computer disks, still photographs,
blueprints, videotapes, engineering drawings, hard copies of aperture
cards, etc., the fee charged will reflect the direct cost to NASA of
reproducing, copying, or scanning the record. In circumstances where a
request for a videotape or other outdated media is requested, and NASA
does not have the capability to readily reproduce the record in the form
or format requested and which requires the Agency to enlist the services
of a private contractor to fulfill the request, the direct costs of any
services by the private contractor will be charged to the requester.
Specific charges will be provided upon request.
(g) If the request for an Agency record required to be made
available under this part requires a computerized search or printout,
the charge for the time of personnel involved shall be at the rates
specified in this part or the direct costs assessed to the Agency. The
charge for computer time involved and for any special supplies or
materials used shall not exceed the direct cost to NASA.
(h) Reasonable standard fees may be charged for additional direct
costs incurred in searching for or duplicating an Agency record in
response to a request under this part. Charges made under this paragraph
include, but are not limited to, the transportation of NASA personnel to
places of record storage for search purposes or freight charges for
transporting records to the personnel searching for or duplicating a
requested record.
(i) Complying with requests for special services such as those
listed in this section is entirely at the discretion of NASA. To the
extent that NASA elects to provide the following services, it will levy
a charge equivalent to the full cost of the service provided:
(1) Certifying that records are true copies.
(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.
(3) Packaging and mailing bulky records that will not fit into the
largest envelope carried in the supply inventory.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.503  Restrictions on charging fees.

(a) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational
institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives
of the news media, unless the records are sought for a commercial use.
(b) If NASA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to
respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the
instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (a) of this
section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in

[[Page 55]]

paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If a NASA component has determined that unusual circumstances as
defined by the FOIA apply, and the component provided timely written
notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply
with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.
(2) If NASA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by
the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to
the request, the Agency may charge search fees, or, in the case of
requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may charge
duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The Agency must have
provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester
in accordance with the FOIA and the component must have discussed with
the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less
than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could
effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C.
552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If the exception in this paragraph (b)(2) is
satisfied, the Agency may charge all applicable fees incurred in the
processing of the request.
(3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist,
as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall
be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(c) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour
period unless more than half of that period is required for search or
review.
(d) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, NASA
will provide without charge:
(1) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for
other media); and
(2) The first two hours of search.
(e) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost
equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated
under Sec.  1206.504 is less than $50.00 for any request, no fee will be
charged.

[79 FR 46678, Aug. 11, 2014, as amended at NASA-2019-0005, 84 FR 54776,
Oct. 11, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  1206.504  Charging fees.

(a) NASA shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in
accordance with the provisions of this section and the OMB Guidelines.
NASA will ordinarily use the most efficient and least expensive method
for processing requested records. In order to resolve any fee issues
that arise under this section, NASA may contact a requester for
additional information. A component ordinarily will collect all
applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. The
submission of a FOIA request shall be considered a firm commitment by
the requester to pay all applicable fees charged under this section, up
to $50.00, unless the requester seeks a waiver of fees. Requesters must
pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the
United States. When a FOIA office determines or estimates the fees to be
assessed in accordance with this section will amount to or exceed
$50.00, the FOIA office shall notify the requester unless the requester
has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If
a portion of the fees can be readily estimated, the FOIA office shall
advise the requester accordingly.
(b) In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or
estimated fees are in excess of $50.00, the request shall be placed on
hold and further work will not be completed until the requester commits
in writing to pay the actual or estimated fees. Such a commitment must
be made by the requester in writing, must indicate a given dollar amount
or a willingness to pay all processing fees, and must be received by the
FOIA office within 20 working days from the date of the letter providing
notification of the fee estimate. If the requester is a noncommercial
use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled
to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge
and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time
at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements
have been provided.
(c) After the FOIA office begins processing a request, if it finds
that the actual cost will exceed the amount the requester previously
agreed to pay, the

[[Page 56]]

FOIA office will stop processing the request and promptly notify the
requester of the higher amount. The request will be placed on hold until
the fee issue has been resolved. If the issue is not resolved within 20
working days from the date of the notification letter, NASA will provide
the requester, if the requester is a non-commercial use requester, the
statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and
shall advise the requester that his statutory entitlements have been
provided before closing the request.
(d) Direct costs, meaning those expenditures that NASA actually
incurs in searching for, duplicating, and downloading computer files and
documents in response to a FOIA request, will be included on the invoice
as appropriate. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the
employee who would ordinarily perform the work (the basic rate of pay
for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), the
cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as
photocopiers and scanners, the costs associated with retrieving records
stored at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, as well as
costs for CDs and other media tools.
(e) NASA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st
day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will
be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from
the billing date until payment is received by the FOIA office. NASA will
follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-
365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures,
including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies,
and offset.
(f) If processing fees are less than $50.00, NASA will send all
releaseable documents (or portions thereof) following the completion of
the initial determination. If fees are greater than $50.00, the
documents will not be released until the invoice has been paid and
verified by the FOIA office.
(g) Final billing will be sent when the initial determination has
been completed. At that time the case will be closed.

Oct. 11, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  1206.505  Advance payments.

(a) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (b), (c),
and (f) of this section, a FOIA office shall not require the requester
to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a
request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment for
search, review and/or before records are released to a requester) is not
an advance payment.
(b) When a FOIA office determines or estimates that a total fee to
be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that
the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire
anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A FOIA office
may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it
receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester.
(c) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly
charged FOIA fee assessed by any FOIA office in the agency within 30
calendar days of the billing date, a FOIA office may require the
requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest due
on the outstanding debt, before the FOIA office begins to process a new
request or continues to process a pending request or any pending remand
of an appeal. Once the outstanding bill has been paid, the FOIA office
may also require the requester to make an advance payment of the full
amount of any anticipated fee before processing the new request.
(d) Where a FOIA office has a reasonable basis to believe that a
requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid
paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide
further proof of identity.
(e) In cases in which a FOIA office requires advance payment, the
request shall not be considered received, and further work will not be
completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does
not pay the advance payment within 20 working days

[[Page 57]]

after the date of the FOIA office's letter, the request will be closed
without further notification.
(f) When advance payment is required in order to initiate
processing, after a fee estimate has been determined, the FOIA office
will require payment before continuing to process the request.
(g) The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged
under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and
collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records
responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule
program, the FOIA office will inform the requester of the contact
information for that source.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.506  Requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees.

(a) The burden is on the requester to justify an entitlement to a
fee waiver. (See Sec.  1206.507 for a discussion on fee categories.)
(b) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered
on a case-by-case basis using the criteria in this section. These
statutory requirements must be satisfied by the requester before
properly assessable fees are waived or reduced under the statutory
standard.
(c) Records shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate
if the requester has demonstrated, based on all available information,
that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it:
(1) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of
the operations or activities of the Government; and
(2) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(d) In deciding whether the standards of paragraph (c)(1) of this
section are satisfied, the Agency must consider the factors described in
paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the
operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the request
must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal
Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or
attenuated.
(2) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to
contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or
activities. The factor in this paragraph (d)(2) is satisfied when the
following criteria are met:
(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully
informative about Government operations or activities. The disclosure of
information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or
a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if
nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a
reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as
opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's
expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public must be
considered. NASA will presume that a representative of the news media
will satisfy the consideration in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).
(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested
information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,
components will consider the following criteria:
(i) NASA, and its Centers processing requests, must identify whether
the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the
requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial,
trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to
provide explanatory information regarding the consideration in this
paragraph (d)(3)(i).
(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, NASA must
determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request.
A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of
paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any
commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the
request.

[[Page 58]]

NASA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has
satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section,
the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the
requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and
market government information for direct economic return will not be
presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the
requirements for a waiver of fees under this section, a waiver shall be
granted for those records.
(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when
the request is first submitted to NASA and should address the criteria
referenced in paragraph (d) of this section. A requester may submit a
fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record
request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has
committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and
that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs
incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.
(e) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or
other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a
request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not
assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific
records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee
waiver.
(f) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the
requirements for a waiver of fees, a partial waiver shall be granted for
those records.
(g) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when
the request is first submitted to the Agency and should address the
criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request
at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or
on administrative appeal.
(h) When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks
for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester will
be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver
request was received by the office processing the original request.
(i) When deciding whether to waive or reduce fees, the FOIA office
will rely on the fee waiver justification submitted in the request
letter. If the request letter does not include sufficient justification,
the FOIA office will either deny the fee waiver request or at its
discretion, ask for additional justification from the requester.
(j) FOIA offices may make available their FOIA Public Liaison or
other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a
request in an effort to reduce fees; however, the FOIA staff may not
assist a requester in composing a request, advising what specific
records to request, or how to write a request to qualify for a fee
waiver.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.507  Categories of requesters.

(a) A request should indicate the fee category. If the requester
does not indicate a fee category, or it is unclear to the FOIA office,
the FOIA office will make a determination of the fee category based on
the request. If the requester does not agree with their determination,
he/she will be afforded the opportunity to provide information to
support a different fee category.
(b) If the request is submitted on behalf of another person or
organization (e.g., if an attorney is submitting a request on behalf of
a client), the fee category will be determined by considering the
underlying requester's identity and intended use of the information. The
following table outlines the basic fee categories and applicable fees:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requester category                 Search fees              Review fees            Duplication fees
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commercial use requester............  Yes....................  Yes....................  Yes.
Educational and non-commercial        No.....................  No.....................  Yes (first 100 pages, or
scientific institutions.                                                                equivalent volume,
without charge).
Representative of news media          No.....................  No.....................  Yes (first 100 pages, or
requester.                                                                              equivalent volume,
without charge).

[[Page 59]]


All other requesters................  Yes (first 2 hours       No.....................  Yes (first 100 pages, or
without charge).                                  equivalent volume,
without charge).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) The FOIA provides for three categories of requesters. However,
for clarity purposes, NASA has broken them down to four for the purposes
of determining fees. These four categories of FOIA requesters are:
Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific
institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other
requesters. The Act prescribes specific levels of fees for each of these
categories, which is indicated in the FOIA fee table above.
(1) Commercial use requesters. When NASA receives a request for
documents appearing to be for commercial use, meaning a request from or
on behalf of one whom seeks information for a use or purpose that
furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include
furthering those interests through litigation, of either the requester
or the person on whose behalf the request is made, it will assess
charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for
release, and duplicating the records sought. NASA will not consider a
commercial-use request for a waiver or reduction of fees based upon an
assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest. A request
from a corporation (not a news media corporation) may be presumed to be
for commercial use unless the requester demonstrates that it qualifies
for a different fee category. Commercial use requesters are not entitled
to two (2) hours of search time or to 100 pages of duplication of
documents without charge.
(2) Education and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.
To be eligible for inclusion in the category in this paragraph (c)(2),
requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and
under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are
not being sought for a commercial use (not operated for commerce, trade,
or profit), but are being sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the
request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the
request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.
(i) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of
scholarly research. A requester in the fee category in this paragraph
(c)(2) must show that the request is made in connection with the
requester's role at the educational institution. NASA may seek assurance
from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly
research and will advise requesters of their placement in the category
in this paragraph (c)(2). A request for educational purposes may be
presumed if submitted on the Institution's letterhead and signed by the
Dean of the School or Department.
(A) Example 1. A request from a professor of geology at a university
for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the
Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational
institution.
(B) Example 2. A request from the same professor of geology seeking
drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of
a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an
institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on
institutional stationery.
(C) Example 3. A student, who makes a request in furtherance of the
student's coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a
copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate
the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of the fee
category in this paragraph (c)(2).
(ii) For the purposes of a non-commercial scientific institution, it
must be solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the
results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or
industry. Requests must be sent on the letterhead of the scientific
institution and signed by the responsible official-in-charge of the
project/program associated with the subject of the documents that are
being requested.

[[Page 60]]

(3) Representative of the news media. (i) NASA shall provide
documents to requesters in the category in this paragraph (c)(3) for the
cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
(ii) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that
gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public,
uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work,
and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means
information that is about current events or that would be of current
interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include
television or radio stations that broadcast ``news'' to the public at
large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate ``news'' and make
their products available through a variety of means to the general
public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the
internet. These examples are not all inclusive. As methods of news
delivery evolve, alternative news media entities may come into
existence. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination
function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial
use. ``Freelance'' journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for
expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as
a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide
the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies
can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this
determination. Agencies will advise requesters of their placement in the
category in this paragraph (c)(3).
(iii) Requesters seeking the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3)
who do not articulate sufficient information to support their request
will not be included in the fee category in this paragraph (c)(3).
Additionally, FOIA staff may grant a reduction of fees if the requester
can articulate the information of this section for some of the
documents.
(4) All other requesters. NASA shall charge requesters who do not
fit into any of the categories mentioned in this section fees in
accordance with the fee table in paragraph (b) of this section.

<r05>
Sec.  1206.508  Aggregation of requests.

(a) A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time,
each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to
avoid payment of fees.
(b) When NASA has reason to believe that a requester or a group of
requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a
series of requests on a single subject or related subjects for the
purpose of avoiding the assessment of fees, NASA will aggregate any such
requests and charge accordingly.
(c) NASA will consider that multiple requests made within a 30-day
period were so intended submitted as such to avoid fees, unless there is
evidence to the contrary.
(d) NASA will aggregate requests separated by a longer period of
time only when there is a reasonable basis for determining that
aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved.
(e) NASA will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects
from one requester or organization.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.509  Form of payment.

Payment shall be made by check or money order payable to the
``Treasury of the United States,'' or by credit card per instructions in
the initial determination or billing invoice and sent to NASA.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.510  Nonpayment of fees.

(a) Requesters are advised that should they fail to pay the fees
assessed, they may be charged interest on the amount billed starting on
the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest
will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
(b) Applicability of Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).
Requesters are advised that if full payment is not received within 60
days after the billing was sent, the procedures of the Debt Collection
Act may be invoked (14 CFR 1261.407-1261.409). These procedures include
three written demand letters at

[[Page 61]]

not more than 30-day intervals, disclosure to a consumer reporting
agency, and the use of a collection agency, where appropriate.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.511  Other rights and services.

Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person to
any service or to the disclosure of any record that is not required
under the FOIA.


<r04>
Subpart F_Commercial Information


<r05>
Sec.  1206.600  General policy.

(a) Notice shall be given to a submitter whenever the information
requested is commercial information and has been designated by the
submitter as information deemed protected from disclosure under
Exemption 4 of the Act, or the Agency otherwise has reason to believe
that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.
For the purpose of applying the notice requirements, commercial
information is information provided by a submitter and in the possession
of NASA, that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under the
provisions of Exemption 4 of the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)). The meaning
ascribed to this term for the purpose of this notice requirement is
separate and should not be confused with use of this or similar terms in
determining whether information satisfies one of the elements of
Exemption 4.
(b) A submitter is a person or entity outside the Federal Government
from whom the Agency directly or indirectly obtains commercial or
financial information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited
to corporations, state governments, individuals, and foreign
governments.
(c) The notice requirements of Sec.  1206.601 will not apply if:
(1) The information has been lawfully published or officially made
available to the public; or
(2) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute (other
than this part); or
(3) The submitter has received notice of a previous FOIA request
which encompassed information requested in the later request, and the
Agency intends to withhold and/or release information in the same manner
as in the previous FOIA request.
(d) An additional limited exception to the notice requirements of
Sec.  1206.601, to be used only when all of the following exceptional
circumstances are found to be present, authorizes the Agency to withhold
information that is the subject of a FOIA request, based on Exemption 4
(5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)), without providing the submitter individual notice
when:
(1) The Agency would be required to provide notice to over ten (10)
submitters, in which case, notification may be accomplished by posting
or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish
notification.
(2) Absent any response to the published notice, the Agency
determines that if it provided notice as is otherwise required by Sec.
1206.601, it is reasonable to assume that the submitter would object to
disclosure of the information based on Exemption 4; and,
(3) If the submitter expressed the anticipated objections, the
Agency would uphold those objections.
(e) The exception shall be used only with the approval of the Chief
Counsel of the Center, the Counsel to the Inspector General, or the
Associate General Counsel responsible for providing advice on the
request. This exception shall not be used for a class of documents or
requests, but only as warranted by an individual FOIA request.


<r05>
Sec.  1206.601  Notice to submitters.

(a) Except as provided in Sec.  1206.603(b) and Sec.  1206.603(c),
the Agency shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a
FOIA request that seeks its commercial information whenever required
under Sec.  1206.600(a).
(b) A notice to a submitter must include:
(1) The exact language of the request or an accurate description of
the request;
(2) Access to or a description of the responsive records or portions
thereof containing the commercial information to the submitter;
(3) A description of the procedures for objecting to the release of
the possibly confidential information under Sec.  1206.602;

[[Page 62]]

(4) A time limit for responding to the Agency that shall not exceed
10 working days from the date of the letter sent to the submitter by the
FOIA Office or publication of the notice (as set forth in Sec.
1206.603(b)) to object to the release and to explain the basis for the
objection;
(5) Notice that the information contained in the submitter's
objections may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA;
(6) Notice that the Agency, not the submitter, is responsible for
deciding whether the information shall be released or withheld;

Subpart 1212.1_Basic Policy


<r05>
Sec.  1212.100  Scope and purpose.

This part 1212 implements the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5
U.S.C. 552a). It establishes procedures for individuals to access their
Privacy Act records and to request amendment of information in records
concerning them. It also provides procedures for administrative appeals
and other remedies. This part applies to systems of records located at
or under the cognizance of NASA Headquarters, NASA Field Centers, and
NASA Component Installations, as defined in part 1201 of this chapter.

[57 FR 4928, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 77 FR 60621, Oct. 4, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1212.101  Definitions.

For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply
in addition to definitions contained in the Privacy Act of 1974, as
amended (5 U.S.C. 552a):
(a) The term individual means a living person who is either a
citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent
residence.
(b) The term maintain includes maintain, collect, use or
disseminate.
(c) The term record means any item, collection, or grouping of
information about an individual including, but not limited to,
education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or
employment history, and that contains a name, or the identifying number,
symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such
as a finger or voice print or a photograph.
(d) The term system of records means a group of any records from
which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some
identifying number, symbol or other identifying particular assigned to
the individual.
(e) The term system manager means the NASA official who is
responsible for a system of records as designated in the system notice
of that system of records published in the Federal Register. When a
system of records includes portions located at more than one NASA
Center, the term system manager includes any subsystem manager
designated in the system notice as being responsible for that portion of
the system of records located at the respective Center.
(f) The term systems notice means, with respect to a system of
records the publication of information in the Federal Register upon
establishment or revision of the existence and character of the system
of records. The notice shall include that information as required by 5
U.S.C. 552a(e)(4).
(g) The term routine use means, with respect to the disclosure of a
record, the use of the record for a purpose which is compatible with the
purpose for which it was collected.
(h) The term NASA employee or NASA official, particularly for the
purpose of Sec.  1212.203(g) relates to the disclosure of a record to
those who have a need for the record in the performance of their
official duties, includes employees of a NASA contractor which operates
or maintains a NASA system of records for or on behalf of NASA.

<r04>
Subpart 1212.2_Requests for Access to Records


<r05>
Sec.  1212.200  Procedures for requesting records subject to the
Privacy Act.

The procedures outlined in this subpart 1212.2 apply to the
following types of requests made by individuals under the Privacy Act
concerning records about themselves:
(a) To determine if information on the requester is included in a
system of records;
(b) For access to a record under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1); and
(c) For an accounting of disclosures of the individual's Privacy Act
records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).

[57 FR 4928, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 77 FR 60621, Oct. 4, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1212.201  Requesting a record.

(a) Individuals may request access to their Privacy Act records,
either in person, in writing, or electronically.
(b) Individuals may also authorize a third party to have access to
their Privacy Act records. This authorization

[[Page 72]]

shall be in writing, signed by the individual, or submitted
electronically. Requests must contain the individual's address or email
address, as well as the name, address or email address of the
representative being authorized access. The identities of both the
subject individual and the representative must be verified in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Sec.  1212.202.
(c)(1) In-person or written requests must be directed to the
appropriate system manager, or, if unknown, to the Center Privacy
Manager or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at NASA Headquarters
or Field Center. The request should be identified clearly on the
envelope and on the letter as a ``Request Under the Privacy Act.''
(2) Electronic requests may be initiated online at https://
www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/HP_Privacy.html.
(3) Where possible, requests should contain the following
information to ensure timely processing:
(i) Name and address of subject.
(ii) Email address of subject, for electronic requests only.
(iii) Identity of the system of records.
(iv) Nature of the request.
(v) Identifying information specified in the applicable system
notice to assist in identifying the request, such as location of the
record, if known, full name, birth date, time periods in which the
records are believed to have been compiled, etc.
(d) NASA has no obligation to comply with a nonspecific request for
access to information concerning an individual, e.g., a request to
provide copies of ``all information contained in your files concerning
me,'' although a good faith effort will be made to locate records if
there is reason to believe NASA has records on the individual. If the
request is so incomplete or incomprehensible that the requested record
cannot be identified, additional information or clarification will be
requested in the acknowledgement, and assistance to the individual will
be offered as appropriate.
(e) If the Center Privacy Manager receives a request for access, the
Privacy Manager will record the date of receipt and immediately forward
the request to the responsible system manager for handling.
(f) If the Center FOIA Office receives a first party request for
records or access, the FOIA Office will process the request under the
Privacy Act pursuant to this part.
(g) Normally, the system manager shall respond to a request for
access within 10 business days of receipt of the request and the access
shall be provided within 30 business days of receipt.
(1) In response to a request for access, the system manager or
Privacy Act Officer shall:
(i) Notify the requester that there is no record on the individual
in the system of records and inform the requester of the procedures to
follow for appeal (see Sec.  1212.4);
(ii) Notify the requester that the record is exempt from disclosure,
cite the appropriate exemption, and inform the requester of the
procedures to follow for appeal (see Sec.  1212.4);
(iii) Upon request, promptly provide copies of the record, subject
to the fee requirements (see Sec.  1212.204); or
(iv) Make the individual's record available for personal inspection
in the presence of a NASA representative.
(2) Unless the system manager agrees to another location, personal
inspection of the record shall be at the location of the record as
identified in the system notice.
(3) When an individual requests records in a system of records
maintained on a third party, the request shall be processed as a FOIA
request under 14 CFR part 1206. If the records requested are subject to
release under FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)), then a Privacy Act exemption may
not be invoked to deny access.
(4) When an individual requests records in a system of records
maintained on the individual, the request shall be processed under this
part. NASA will not rely on exemptions contained in FOIA to withhold any
record which is otherwise accessible to the individual under this part.

[NASA-21-091; NASA-2021-0007, 88 FR 12148, Feb. 27, 2023]

office of NASA, a component of which performs as its principal function
activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal

[[Page 77]]

laws, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). This exemption applies
only to those records and information contained in the system of records
pertaining to criminal investigations. This system of records is exempt
for one or more of the following reasons:
(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.
(B) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure
of information about third parties, including other subjects of
investigation, investigators, and witnesses.
(C) To protect the identity of Federal employees who furnish a
complaint or information to the OIG, consistent with section 7(b) of the
Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.
(D) To protect the confidentiality of non-Federal employee sources
of information.
(E) To assure access to sources of confidential information,
including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law
enforcement information systems.
(F) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and
procedures.
(G) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential
sources and law enforcement personnel.
(ii) Investigative records within this system of records which are
compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the
scope of subsection (j)(2), are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(2): Provided, however, That if any individual is denied any
right, privilege, or benefit that they would otherwise be entitled by
Federal law, or for which they would otherwise be eligible, as a result
of the maintenance of such material, such material shall be provided to
such individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of such
material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information
to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the
source would be held in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under
an implied promise that the identity of the sources would be held in
confidence. This system of records is exempt for one or more of the
following reasons:
(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.
(B) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement
purposes.
(C) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure
of information about third parties, including other subjects of
investigation, law enforcement personnel, and sources of information.
(D) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of
sources.
(E) To protect the identity of Federal employees who furnish a
complaint or information to the OIG, consistent with section 7(b) of the

including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law
enforcement information systems.
(G) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and
procedures.
(H) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential
sources and law enforcement personnel.
(iii) Records within this system of records comprised of
investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining
suitability or eligibility for Federal civilian employment or access to
classified information, are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that disclosure would reveal the
identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under
an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in
confidence, or prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that
the identity of the source would be held in confidence. This system of
records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:
(A) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of
sources.
(B) To assure access to sources of confidential information,
including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law
enforcement information systems.
(b) Security Records System--(1) Sections of the Act from which
exempted. The Security Records System is exempted from the following
sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a): (c)(3)

[[Page 78]]

relating to access to the disclosure accounting; (d) relating to access
to the records; (e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in
the records; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing the system
notice information as to agency procedures for access and amendment, and
information as to the categories of sources of records; and (f) relating
to developing Agency rules for gaining access and making corrections.
(2) Reason for exemption. (i) Personnel Security Records contained
in the system of records which are compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal
civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to classified
information are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), but
only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the
identity of the source who furnished information to the Government under
an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in
confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise that
the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This system of
records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:
(A) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of
sources.
(B) To assure access to sources of confidential information,
including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law
enforcement information systems.
(ii) Criminal Matter Records are contained in the system of records
and are exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): Provided,
however, That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or
benefit that they would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for
which they would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance
of such material, such material shall be provided to such individual,
except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal
the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government
under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held
in confidence, or, prior to January 1, 1975, under an implied promise
that the identity of the sources would be held in confidence. This
system of records is exempt for one or more of the following reasons:
(A) To prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings.
(B) To protect investigatory material compiled for law enforcement
purposes.
(C) To avoid unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, by disclosure
of information about third parties, including other subjects of
investigation, law enforcement personnel, and sources of information.
(D) To fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of
sources.
(E) To assure access to sources of confidential information,
including that contained in Federal, State, and local criminal law
enforcement information systems.
(F) To prevent disclosure of law enforcement techniques and
procedures.
(G) To avoid endangering the life or physical safety of confidential
sources and law enforcement personnel.
(iii) The system of records includes records subject to the
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1) (required by Executive order to be kept
secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy), and such
records are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1).
(c) Harassment Report Case Files--(1) Sections of the Act from which
exempted. Harassment Report Case Files records are exempt under 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(2) from the following sections of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.
552a): subsection (c)(3) relating to access to the disclosure
accounting; subsection (d) relating to access to the records; subsection
(e)(1) relating to the type of information maintained in the records;
subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) relating to publishing in the annual
system notice information as to agency procedures for access and
correction and information as to the categories of sources of records;
and subsection (f) relating to developing agency rules for gaining
access and making corrections.
(2) Reason for exemption--(i) Subsection (c)(3). The release of the
disclosure accounting to the individual who is the subject of the
investigation/fact-finding would present a serious impediment to NASA's
ability to conduct fact-findings into potential violations of law or
policy.

[[Page 79]]

(ii) Subsection (d). Access to records contained in this system
would inform the subject of an actual or potential investigation, of the
existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the
investigation, of the information and evidence obtained as to their
activities, and of the identity of witnesses. Such access would impede a
fact-finder/investigator's ability to freely investigate such cases,
including concerns that some witnesses have been promised
confidentiality and would not want their statements provided to the
subject of the investigation. Amendment of the records would interfere
with the ongoing fact-finding process.
(iii) Subsection (e)(1). Under the provision of (e)(1), the agency
must only maintain such information that is relevant and necessary. It
is difficult to know during the course of an investigation what is
relevant and necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not
seem relevant at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance
is borne out.
(iv) Subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H). These subsections are
inapplicable to the extent that these systems are exempt from the access
provisions of subsection (d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).
(v) Subsection (e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records
in these systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad
generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I)
of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should
be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of
the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary
to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and related
law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to
protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
(vi) Subsection (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant
to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the
individual dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or
regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such
notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct
and/or completion of an investigation or case, pending or future. In
addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the
subject or others that their activities are under investigation or may
become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to
avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence,
or to fabricate testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for
subsection (d) of the Act, the rules required pursuant to subsections
(f)(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these systems of records to the
extent that these systems of records are exempted from subsection (d).
(3) Determination. NASA has determined that the exemption of this
system of records from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G),
(e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f) of the Privacy Act is necessary for the
Agency's law enforcement efforts to address and eradicate harassment in
its workplace.

[57 FR 4928, Feb. 11, 1992, as amended at 77 FR 60621, Oct. 4, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1212.604  Social security numbers.

<r05>
Sec.  1212.605  Safeguarding information in systems of records.

(a) Safeguards appropriate for a NASA system of records shall be
developed by the system manager in a written plan approved by the Center
Security Officer or Center Information Technology Security Officer for
electronic records maintained in automated systems. Safeguards must
insure the security and confidentiality of records and protect against
any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which
could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.

Sec.  1212.606  Duplicate copies of records or portions of records.

(a) NASA officials may maintain and use, for official purposes,
duplicate copies of records or portions of records from a system of
records maintained by their own organizational unit. This practice
should occur only where there are justifiable organizational needs for
it, e.g., where geographic distances make use of the system of records
time consuming or inconvenient. These duplicate copies shall not be
considered a separate NASA system of records. For example, an office
head or designee may keep duplicate copies of personnel, training, or
similar records on employees within the organization for administrative
convenience purposes.
(b) No disclosure shall be made from duplicate copies outside of the
organizational unit. Any outside request for disclosure shall be
referred to the appropriate system manager for response.
(c) Duplicate copies are subject to the same safeguard requirements
applicable to the system of records.

approved by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, which will
be managed by Headquarters and/or a designated NASA Center.
(k) Public affairs activities for NASA-funded missions will not be
managed by non-NASA institutions, unless authorized by the Assistant
Administrator for Public Affairs.


<r05>
Sec.  1213.104  Public information coordination and concurrence.

(a) General. All NASA employees involved in preparing and issuing
NASA public information are responsible for proper coordination among
Headquarters and Center offices to include review and clearance by
appropriate officials prior to issuance. Such coordination will be
accomplished through procedures developed and published by the NASA
Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs.
(b) Coordination. To ensure timely release of public information,
Headquarters and Center Public Affairs Officers are required to
coordinate to obtain review and clearance by appropriate officials, keep
each other informed of changes, delays, or cancellation of releases, and
provide advance notification of the actual release.
(c) All public information shall be coordinated through the
appropriate Headquarters offices, including review by the appropriate
Mission Directorate Associate Administrator and Mission Support Office
head, or their designees, to ensure scientific, technical, and
programmatic accuracy, and review by the Assistant Administrator for

access to the NASA officials they seek to interview, provided those NASA
officials agree to be interviewed.
(c) NASA employees may speak to the media and the public about their
work. When doing so, employees shall notify their immediate supervisor
and coordinate with their public affairs office in advance of interviews
whenever possible, or immediately thereafter, and are encouraged, to the
maximum extent practicable, to have a Public Affairs Officer present
during interviews. If Public Affairs Officers are present, their role
will be to attest to the content of the interview, support the
interviewee, and provide post-interview follow up with the media, as
necessary.
(d) NASA, as an Agency, does not take a position on any scientific
conclusions. That is the role of the broad scientific community and the
nature of the scientific process. NASA scientists may draw conclusions
and may, consistent with this policy, communicate those conclusions to
the media. However, NASA employees who present personal views outside
their official area of expertise or responsibility must make clear that
they are presenting their individual views--not the views of the
Agency--and ask that they be sourced as such.
(e) Appropriated funds may only be used to support Agency missions
and objectives consistent with legislative or presidential direction.
Government funds shall not be used for media interviews or other
communication activities that go beyond the scope of Agency
responsibilities and/or an employee's official area of expertise or
responsibility.
(f) Media interviews will be ``on-the-record'' and attributable to
the person making the remarks, unless the interviewee is authorized to
do otherwise by the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs or Center
Public Affairs Director, or their designees. Any NASA employee providing
material to the press will identify himself/herself as the source.
(g) Audio recordings may be made by NASA with consent of the
interviewee.
(h) NASA employees are not required to speak to the media.
(i) Public information volunteered by a NASA official will not be
considered exclusive to any one media source and will be made available
to other sources, if requested.


<r05>
Sec.  1213.106  Preventing release of classified information to the media.

(a) Release of classified information in any form (e.g., documents,
through interviews, audio/visual) to the news media is prohibited. The
disclosure of classified information to unauthorized individuals may be
cause for prosecution and/or disciplinary action against the NASA
employee involved. Ignorance of NASA policy and procedures regarding
classified information does not release a NASA employee from
responsibility for preventing any unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1,
Chapter 5, Section 5.23 for internal NASA guidance on management of
classified information. For further guidance that applies to all
agencies, see Executive Order 12958, as amended, ``Classified National
Security Information,'' and its implementing directive at 32 CFR parts
2001 and 2004.
(b) Any attempt by news media representatives to obtain classified
information will be reported through the Headquarters Office of Public
Affairs or Installation Public Affairs Office to the Installation
Security Office and Office of Security and Program Protection.
(c) For classified operations and/or programs managed under the
auspices of a DD Form 254, ``Contract Security

[[Page 88]]

Classification Specification,'' all inquiries concerning this activity
will be responded to by the appropriate PAO official designated in Item
12 on the DD Form 254.
(d) For classified operations and/or information owned by other
Government agencies (e.g., DOD, DOE), all inquiries will be referred to
the appropriate Agency Public Affairs Officer as established in written
agreements.


<r05>
Sec.  1213.107  Preventing unauthorized release of sensitive but
unclassified (SBU) information/material to the news media.

(a) All NASA SBU information requires accountability and approval
for release. Release of SBU information to unauthorized personnel is
prohibited. Unauthorized release of SBU information may result in
prosecution and/or disciplinary action. Ignorance of NASA policy and
procedures regarding SBU information does not release a NASA employee
from responsibility for unauthorized release. See NPR 1600.1, Chapter 5,
Section 5.24 for guidance on identification, marking, accountability and
release of NASA SBU information.
(b) Examples of SBU information include: proprietary information of
others provided to NASA under nondisclosure or confidentiality
agreement; source selection and bid and proposal information;
information subject to export control under the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR);
information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974; predecisional materials
such as national space policy not yet publicly released; pending
reorganization plans or sensitive travel itineraries; and information
that could constitute an indicator of U.S. Government intentions,
capabilities, operations, or activities or otherwise threaten operations
security.
(c) Upon request for access to information/material deemed SBU,
coordination must be made with the information/material owner to
determine if the information/material may be released. Other
organizations that play a part in SBU information identification,
accountability, and release (e.g., General Counsel, External Relations,
Procurement) must be consulted for assistance and/or concurrence prior
to release.
(d) Requests for SBU information from other Government agencies must
be referred to the NASA program or other office responsible for handling
the information as SBU.


<r05>
Sec.  1213.108  Multimedia materials.

(a) NASA's multimedia material, from all sources, will be made
available to the information media, the public, and to all Agency
Centers and contractor installations utilizing contemporary delivery
methods and emerging digital technology.
(b) Centers will provide the media, the public, and as necessary,
NASA Headquarters with:
(1) Selected prints and original or duplicate files of news-oriented
imagery and other digital multimedia material generated within their
respective areas.
(2) Selected video material in the highest quality format practical,
which, in the opinion of the installations, would be appropriate for use
as news feed material or features in pre-produced programs and other
presentations.
(3) Audio and/or video files of significant news developments and
other events of historic or public interest.
(4) Interactive multimedia features that can be incorporated into
the Agency's Internet portal for use by internal and external audiences,
including the media and the general public.
(5) To the extent practicable, these products will be in forms and
media accessible to the public at large, as well as to specific user
groups requesting them, if any.


<r05>
Sec.  1213.109  News releases concerning international activities.

(a) Releases of information involving NASA activities, views,
programs, or projects involving another country or an international
organization require prior coordination and approval by the Headquarters
offices of External Relations and Public Affairs.
(b) NASA Centers and Headquarters offices will report all visits
proposed by representatives of foreign news media

[[Page 89]]

to the Public Affairs Officer of the Office of External Relations for
appropriate handling consistent with all NASA policies and procedures.

Code of Conduct for the International Space Station Crew

I. Introduction

A. Authority

This Code of Conduct for the International Space Station (ISS) crew,
hereinafter referred to as Crew Code of Conduct (CCOC), is established
pursuant to:
(1) Article 11 (Crew) of the intergovernmental Agreement Among the
Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the European Space
Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian
Federation, and the Government of the United States of America
Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station (the
IGA) signed by the Partner States on January 29, 1998; and
(2) Article 11 (Space Station Crew) of the Memoranda of
Understanding between, respectively, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration of the United States of America (NASA) and the Canadian
Space Agency (CSA), NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), NASA and
the Government of Japan (GOJ), and NASA and the Russian Space Agency
(RSA) Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station
(the MOU's), which require, inter alia, that the crew Code of Conduct be
developed by the partners.

B. Scope and Content

The partners have developed and approved this CCOC to: establish a
clear chain of command on-orbit; establish a clear relationship between
ground and on-orbit management; and establish a management hierarchy;
set forth standards for work and activities in space, and, as
appropriate, on the ground; establish responsibilities with respect to
elements and equipment; set forth disciplinary regulations; establish
physical and information security guidelines; and define the ISS
Commander's authority and responsibility, on behalf of all the partners,
to enforce safety procedures, physical and information security
procedures and crew rescue procedures for the ISS. This CCOC and the
disciplinary policy referred to in Section IV shall not limit the
application of Article 22 of the IGA. This CCOC succeeds the NASA-RSA
Interim Code of Conduct, which was developed pursuant to Article 11.2 of
the MOU between NASA and RSA to cover early assembly prior to other
partners' flight opportunities.

[[Page 91]]

This CCOC sets forth the standards of conduct applicable to all ISS
crewmembers during preflight, on-orbit, and post-flight activities,
(including launch and return phases). ISS crewmembers are subject to
additional requirements, such as the ISS Flight Rules, the disciplinary
policy, and requirements imposed by their Cooperating Agency or those
relating to the Earth-to-Orbit Vehicle (ETOV) transporting an ISS
crewmember. Each ISS crewmember has a right to know about such
additional requirements. ISS crewmembers will also abide by the rules of
the institution hosting the training, and by standards and requirements
defined by the Multilateral Crew Operations Panel (MCOP), the
Multilateral Space Medicine Board (MSMB) and the Multilateral Medical
Operations Panel (MMOP). Each ISS crewmember will be informed by the
Cooperating Agency providing him or her of the responsibilities of ISS
crewmembers under the IGA, the MOU's and this CCOC. Further, each ISS
crewmember will be educated by the Cooperating Agency providing him or
her through the crew training curriculum and normal program operations
as to ISS program rules, operational directives and management policies.
Completion of postflight activities shall not affect an ISS crewmember's
continuing obligations under Section V of this CCOC.

C. Definitions

For the purposes of the CCOC:
(1) ``Cooperating Agency'' means NASA, CSA, ESA, Rosaviakosmos
(formerly RSA) and, in the case of Japan, the Science and Technology
Agency of Japan (STA) and, as appropriate, the National Space
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), assisting agency to STA.
(2) ``Crew Surgeon'' means a Flight Surgeon assigned by the MMOP to
any given expedition. He or she is the lead medical officer and carries
primary responsibility for the health and well-being of the entire ISS
crew.
(3) ``Disciplinary policy'' means the policy developed by the MCOP
to address violations of the CCOC and impose disciplinary measures.
(4) ``ETOV'' means Earth-to-Orbit Vehicle travelling between Earth
and the ISS.
(5) ``Flight Director'' means the Flight Director in control of the
ISS.
(6) ``Flight Rules'' means the set of rules used by the Cooperating
Agencies to govern flight operations.
(7) ``ISS crewmembers'' means any person approved for flight to the
ISS, including both ISS expedition crew and visiting crew, beginning
upon assignment to the crew for a specific and ending upon completion of
the postflight activities related to the mission.

II. General Standards

A. Responsibilities of ISS Crewmembers

ISS Crewmembers shall comply with the CCOC. Accordingly, during
preflight, on-orbit, and postflight activities, they shall comply with
the ISS Commander's orders, all Flight and ISS program Rules,
operational directives, and management policies, as applicable. These
include those related to safety, health, well-being, security, and other
operational or management matters governing all aspects of ISS elements,
equipment, payloads and facilities, and non-ISS facilities, to which
they have access. All applicable rules, regulations, directives, and
policies shall be made accessible to ISS crewmembers through appropriate
means, coordinated by the MCOP.

B. General Rules of Conduct

ISS Crewmembers' conduct shall be such as to maintain a harmonious
and cohesive relationship among the ISS crewmembers and an appropriate
level of mutual confidence and respect through an interactive,
participative, and relationship-oriented approach which duly takes into
account the international and multicultural nature of the crew and
mission.
No ISS crewmember shall, by his or her conduct, act in a manner
which results in or creates the appearance of: (1) Giving undue
preferential treatment to any person or entity in the performance of ISS
activities; and/or (2) adversely affecting the confidence of the public
in the integrity of, or reflecting unfavorably in a public forum on, any
ISS partner, partner state or Cooperating Agency.
ISS crewmembers shall protect and conserve all property to which
they have access for ISS activities. No such property shall be altered
or removed for any purpose other than those necessary for the
performance of ISS duties. Before altering or removing any such
property, ISS crewmembers shall first obtain authorization from the
Flight Director, except as necessary to ensure the immediate safety of
ISS crewmembers or ISS elements, equipment, or payloads.

C. Use of Position

ISS crewmembers shall refrain from any use of the position of ISS
crewmember that is motivated, or has the appearance of being motivated,
by private gain, including financial gain, for himself or herself or
other persons or entities. Performance of ISS duties shall not be
considered to be motivated by private gain. Furthermore, no ISS
crewmember shall use the position of ISS crewmember in any way to
coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide
any financial benefit to himself or herself or other persons or
entities.

[[Page 92]]

D. Mementos and Personal Effects

Each ISS crewmember may carry and store mementos, including flags,
patches, insignia, and similar small items of minor value, onboard the
ISS, for his or her private use, subject to the following:
(1) mementos are permitted as a courtesy, not an entitlement; as
such they shall be considered as ballast as opposed to a payload or
mission requirement and are subject to manifest limitations, on-orbit
stowage allocations, and safety considerations;
(2) mementos may not be sold, transferred for sale, used or
transferred for personal gain, or used or transferred for any commercial
or fundraising purpose. Mementos which, by their nature, lend themselves
to exploitation by the recipients, or which, in the opinion of the
Cooperating Agency providing the ISS crewmember, engender questions as
to good taste, will not be permitted.
An ISS crewmember's personal effects, such as a wristwatch, will not
be considered mementos. Personal effects of any nature may be permitted,
subject to constraints of mass/volume allowances for crew personal
effects, approval of the ISS crewmember's Cooperating Agency, and
approval of the transporting Cooperating Agency and considerations of
safety and good taste.
If a Cooperating Agency carries and stores items onboard the ISS in
connection with separate arrangements, these items will not be
considered mementos of the ISS crewmembers.

III. Authority and Responsibilities of the ISS Commander, Chain of
Command and Succession Onorbit; Relationship Between Ground and On-Orbit
Management

A. Authority and Responsibilities of the ISS Commander

The ISS Commander, as an ISS crewmember, is subject to the standards
detailed elsewhere in this CCOC, in addition to the command-specific
provisions set forth below:
The ISS Commander will seek to maintain a harmonious and cohesive
relationship among the ISS crewmembers and an appropriate level of
mutual confidence and respect through an interactive, participative, and
relationship-oriented approach which duly takes into account the
international and multicultural nature of the crew and mission.
For avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section shall affect the
ability of the MCOP to designate the national of any Partner State as an
ISS Commander.

(1) During Preflight and Postflight Activities

The ISS Commander is the leader of the crew and is responsible for
forming the individual ISS crewmembers into a single, integrated team.
During preflight activities, the ISS Commander, to the extent of his or
her authority, leads the ISS crewmembers through the training curriculum
and mission-preparation activities and seeks to ensure that the ISS
crewmembers are adequately prepared for the mission, acting as the
crew's representative to the ISS program's training, medical,
operations, and utilization authorities. During postflight activities,
the ISS Commander coordinates as necessary with these authorities to
ensure that the ISS crewmembers complete the required postflight
activities.

(2) During On-Orbit Operations

(a) General

The ISS Commander is responsible for and will, to the extent of his
or her authority and the ISS on-orbit capabilities, accomplish the
mission program implementation and ensure the safety of the ISS
crewmembers and the protection of the ISS elements, equipment, or
payloads.

(b) Main Responsibilities

The ISS Commander's main responsibilities are to: (1) Conduct
operations in or on the ISS as directed by the Flight Director and in
accordance with the Flight Rules, plans and procedures; (2) direct the
activities of the ISS crewmembers as a single, integrated team to ensure
the successful completion of the mission; (3) fully and accurately
inform the Flight Director, in a timely manner, of the ISS vehicle
configuration, status, commanding, and other operational activities on-
board (including off-nominal or emergency situations); (4) enforce
procedures for the physical and information security of operations and
utilization data; (5) maintain order; (6) ensure crew safety, health and
well-being including crew rescue and return; and (7) take all reasonable
action necessary for the protection of the ISS elements, equipment, or
payloads.

(c) Scope of Authority

During all phases of on-orbit activity, the ISS Commander,
consistent with the authority of the Flight Director, shall have the
authority to use any reasonable and necessary means to fulfill his or
her responsibilities. This authority, which shall be exercised
consistent with the provisions of Sections II and IV, extends to: (1)
the ISS elements, equipment, and payloads; (2) the ISS crewmembers; (3)
activities of any kind occurring in or on the ISS; and (4) data and
personal effects in or on the ISS where necessary to protect the safety
and well-being of the ISS crewmembers and the ISS elements, equipment,
and payloads. Any matter outside the ISS Commander's authority shall be
within the purview of the Flight Director.

[[Page 93]]

Issues regarding the Commander's use of such authority shall be
referred to the Flight Director as soon as practicable, who will refer
the matter to appropriate authorities for further handling. Although
other ISS crewmembers may have authority over and responsibility for
certain ISS elements, equipment, payloads, or tasks, the ISS Commander
remains ultimately responsible, and solely accountable, to the Flight
Director for the successful completion of the activities and the
mission.

B. Chain of Command and Succession On-orbit

(1) The ISS Commander is the highest authority among the ISS
crewmembers on-orbit. The MCOP will determine the order of succession
among the ISS crewmembers in advance of flight, and the Flight Rules set
forth the implementation of a change of command.
(2) Relationship of the ISS Commander to ETOV and Other Commanders
The Flight Rules define the authority of the ETOV Commander, the
Rescue Vehicle Commander, and any other commanders, and set forth the
relationship between their respective authorities and the authority of
the ISS Commander.

C. Relationship Between the ISS Commander (On-Orbit Management) and the
Flight Director (Ground Management)

The Flight Director is responsible for directing the mission. A
Flight Director will be in charge of directing real-time ISS operations
at all time. The ISS Commander, working under the direction of the
Flight Director and in accordance with the Flight Rules, is responsible
for conducting on-orbit operations in the manner best suited to the
effective implementation of the mission. The ISS Commander, acting on
his or her own authority, is entitled to change the daily routine of the
ISS crewmembers where necessary to address contingencies, perform urgent
work associated with crew safety and the protection of the ISS elements,
equipment or payloads, or conduct critical flight operations. Otherwise,
the ISS Commander should implement the mission as directed by the Flight
Director. Specific roles and responsibilities of the ISS Commander and
the Flight Director are described in the Flight Rules. The Flight Rules
outline decisions planned in advance of the mission and are designed to
minimize the amount of real-time discussion required during mission
operations.

IV. Disciplinary Regulations

ISS crewmembers will be subject to the disciplinary policy developed
and revised as necessary by the MCOP and approved by the Multilateral
Coordination Board (MCB). The MCOP has developed an initial disciplinary
policy which has been approved by the MCB. The disciplinary policy is
designed to maintain order among the ISS crewmembers during preflight,
on-orbit and postflight activities. The disciplinary policy is
administrative in nature and is intended to address violations of the
CCOC. Such violations may, inter alia, affect flight assignments as an
ISS crewmember. The disciplinary policy does not limit a Cooperating
Agency's right to apply relevant laws, regulations, policies, and
procedures to the ISS crewmembers it provides, consistent with the IGA
and the MOU's.

V. Physical and Information Security Guidelines

The use of all equipment and goods to which ISS crewmembers have
access shall be limited to the performance of ISS duties. Marked or
otherwise identified as export controlled data and marked proprietary
data obtained by an ISS crewmember in the course of ISS activities shall
only be used in the performance of his or her ISS duties. With respect
to data first generated on-board the ISS, the ISS crewmembers will be
advised by the appropriate Cooperating Agency or by the data owner or
provider through that Cooperating Agency as to the proprietary or
export-controlled nature of the data and will be directed to mark and
protect such data and to continue such protection for as long as the
requirements for such protection remain in place. Additionally, ISS
crewmembers shall act in a manner consistent with the provisions of the
IGA and the MOU's regarding protection of operations data, utilization
data, and the intellectual property of ISS users. They shall also comply
with applicable ISS program rules, operational directives, and
management policies designed to further such protections.
Personal information about ISS crewmembers, including all medical
information, private family conference, or other private information,
whether from verbal, written, or electronic sources, shall not be used
or disclosed by other ISS crewmembers for any purpose, without the
consent of the affected ISS crewmember, except as required for the
immediate safety of ISS crewmembers or the protection of ISS elements,
equipment, or payloads. In particular, all personal medical information,
whether derived from medical monitoring, investigations, or medical
contingency events, shall be treated as private medical information and
shall be transmitted in a private and secure fashion in accordance with
procedures to be set forth by the MMOP. Medical data which must be
handled in this fashion includes, for example, biomedical telemetry,
private medical communications, and medical investigation

[[Page 94]]

data. Nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted to limit an ISS
crewmember's access to all medical resources aboard the ISS, to ground-
based medical support services, or to his or her own medical data during
preflight, on-orbit, and postflight activities.

VI. Protection of Human Research Subjects

No research on human subjects shall be conducted which could, with
reasonable foresight, be expected to jeopardize the life, health,
physical integrity, or safety of the subject.
No research procedures shall be undertaken with any ISS crewmember
as a human subject without: (1) written approval by the Human Research
Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB) and (2) the full written and informed
consent of the human subject. Each such approval and consent shall be
obtained prior to the initiation of such research, and shall fully
comply with the requirements of the HRMRB. The HRMRB is responsible for
procedures for initiation of new experiments on-orbit when all consent
requirements have been met, but the signature of the human subject
cannot be obtained; explicit consent of the human subject will
nonetheless be required in all such cases. Subjects volunteering for
human research protocols may at their own discretion, and without
providing a rationale, withdraw their consent for participation at any
time, without prejudice, and without incurring disciplinary action. In
addition, approval or consent for any research may be revoked at any
time, including after the commencement of the research, by: the HRMRB,
the Crew Surgeon, the Flight Director, or the ISS Commander, as
appropriate, if the research would endanger the ISS Crew Member or
otherwise threaten the mission success. A decision to revoke consent by
the human subject or approval by the other entities listed above will be
final.

<r05>
Sec.  1215.100  General.

TDRSS represents a major investment by the U.S. Government with the
primary goal of providing improved tracking and data acquisition
services to spacecraft in low-Earth orbit or to mobile terrestrial users
such as aircraft or balloons. It is the objective of NASA to operate as
efficiently as possible with TDRSS, is to the mutual benefit of all
users. Such user consideration will permit NASA and non-NASA service to
be delivered without compromising the mission objectives of any
individual user. The reimbursement policy is designed to comply with the
Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25 on User Charges, dated
September 23, 1959, as updated, which requires that a reasonable charge
should be made to each identifiable recipient for a measurable unit or
amount of Government service or property from which a special benefit is
derived.

[77 FR 6952, Feb. 10, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.101  Scope.

This subpart sets forth the policy governing TDRSS services provided
to non-U.S. Government users and the reimbursement for rendering such
services. Cooperative missions are not under the purview of this
subpart. The arrangements for TDRSS services for cooperative missions
will be covered in an agreement, as a consequence of negotiations
between NASA and the other concerned party. Any agreement which includes
provision for any TDRSS service will require signatory concurrence by
the Deputy Associate

[[Page 99]]

Administrator for SCaN prior to dedicating SCaN resources for support of
a cooperative mission.

[56 FR 28048, June 19, 1991]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.105  Delivery of user data.

(a) As a standard service, NASA will provide to the user its data
from TDRSS in the form of one or more digital or analog bit streams
synchronized to associated clock streams at WSC or GRGT.
(b) User data-handling requirements beyond WSC or GRGT interface
will be provided as a standard service to the user, to the extent that
the requirements do not exceed NASA's planned standard communications
system. Any additional data transport or handling requirements exceeding
NASA's capability will be dealt with as a mission-unique service.
(c) No storage of the user data is provided in the standard service.
NASA will provide short-term temporary recording of data at WSC in the
event of a NASA Integrated Services Network (NISN) link outage.
(d) NASA will provide TDRSS services on a ``reasonable efforts''
basis, and, accordingly, will not be liable for damages of any kind to
the user or third parties for any reason, including, but not limited to,
failure to provide agreed-to services. The price for TDRSS services does
not include a contingency or premium for any potential damages. The user
will assume any risk of damages or obtain insurance to protect against
any risk.

[[Page 100]]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.106  User command and tracking data.

(a) User command data shall enter TDRSS via the NISN interface at
WSC or GRGT.
(b) NASA is required to have knowledge of the user satellite orbital
elements to sufficient accuracy to permit TDRSS to establish and
maintain acquisition. This can be accomplished in two ways:
(1) The user can provide the orbital elements in a NASA format to
meet TDRSS operational requirements.
(2) The user shall ensure that a sufficient quantity of tracking
data is received to permit the determination of the user satellite
orbital elements. The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) at GSFC will
provide the orbit determination service to these users. The charges for
this service will be negotiated between the FDF and the user and will be
dependent on user requirements.

[77 FR 6952, Feb. 10, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.107  User data security and frequency authorizations.

(a) User data security is not provided by the TDRSS. Responsibility
for data security resides solely with the user. Users desiring data
safeguards shall provide and operate, external to the TDRSS, the
necessary equipment or systems to accomplish data security. Any such
user provisions must be compatible with data flow through TDRSS and not
interfere with other users.
(b) All radio frequency authorizations associated with operations
pursuant to this directive are the responsibility of the user. If
appropriate, authority(ies) must be obtained from the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for operations consistent with U.S.
footnote 303 of the National Table of Frequency Allocations, FCC Rules
and Regulations, at 47 CFR 2.106.

<r05>
Sec.  1215.108  Defining user service requirements.

Potential users should become familiar with TDRSS capabilities and
constraints, which are detailed in the NSNUG, as early as possible. This
action allows the user to evaluate the trade-offs available among
various TDRSS services, spacecraft design, operations planning, and
other significant mission parameters. It is recommended that potential
users contact the Near Space Network as early as possible for assistance
in performing the trade studies. When these evaluations have been
completed, and the user desires to use TDRSS, the user should initiate a
request for TDRSS service.
(a) Initial requests for TDRSS service from non-U.S. Government
users shall be addressed to SCaN at NASA Headquarters, as follows:
Deputy Associate Administrator: Space Communications and Navigation
Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC
20546.
(b) Upon review and acceptance of the service request, preliminary
analyses shall be performed to determine the feasibility of meeting the
proposed requirements.
(c) If the request is determined to be feasible, the user and SCaN
shall negotiate an agreement for provision of the requested services.
Acceptance of user requests for TDRSS service is the sole prerogative of
NASA.
(d) Upon approval of the agreement by both parties, GSFC will be
assigned to produce the detailed requirements, plans, and documentation
necessary for support of the mission. Changes to user requirements shall
be made as far in advance as possible and shall be submitted, in
writing, to both SCaN at NASA Headquarters (see Section 108, paragraph
(a) for mailing address) and GSFC, as follows: Chief: Commercialization,
Innovation, and Synergies, Code 450.1, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
M/S 450.1, 8800 Greenbelt Road Greenbelt, MD 20771.

<r05>
Sec.  1215.109  Scheduling user service.

(a) User service shall be scheduled only by NASA. TDRSS services
will be provided in accordance with operational priorities established
by the NASA Administrator or his/her designee. See Appendix A for a
description of a typical user activity timeline.
(b) Schedule conflict will be resolved in general by application of
principles

[[Page 101]]

of priority to user service requirements. Services shall be provided
either as normally scheduled service or as emergency service. Priorities
will be different for emergency service than for normal services.
(1) Normally scheduled service is service which is planned and
ordered under normal operational conditions and is subject to schedule
conflict resolution under normal service priorities. Requests for
normally scheduled service must be received by the schedulers at the
GSFC WSC Data Services Management Center (DSMC) no later than 21 days
prior to the requested support time.
(2) At times, emergency service requirements will override normal
schedule priority. Under emergency service conditions, disruptions to
scheduled service will occur.
(3) The DSMC reserves the sole right to schedule, reschedule, or
cancel TDRSS service.
(4) NASA schedulers will exercise judgment and endeavor to see that
lower-priority users are not excluded from a substantial portion of
their contracted-for service due to the requirements of higher-priority
users.
(c) General user service requirements, which will be used for
preliminary planning and mission modeling, should include all pertinent
information necessary for NASA to determine if the proposed service is
achievable. Contact Near Space Network to discuss usage and
requirements.
(d) Such user service requirements information typically includes:
(1) Date of service initiation.
(2) The type of TDRSS services desired (e.g., multiple access,
tracking, etc.), and the frequency and duration of each service.
(3) Orbit or trajectory parameters and tracking data requirements.
(4) Spacecraft events significant to tracking, telemetry or command
requirements.
(5) Communications systems specifics, including location of antennas
and other related information dealing with user tracking, command, and
data systems.
(6) Special test requirements, data flows, and simulations, etc.
(7) Identification of terrestrial data transport requirements,
interface points, and delivery locations, including latency and line
loss recovery.
(e) To provide for effective planning, reference Appendix A, Typical
New User Activity Timeline.

<r05>
Sec.  1215.110  User cancellation of all services.

The user has the right to terminate its service contract with NASA
at any time. A user who exercises this right after contracting for
service shall pay the charge agreed upon for services previously
rendered, and the cost incurred by the Government for support of pre-
launch activities, services, and mission documentation not included in
that charge. The user will remain responsible for the charges for any
services actually provided.


<r05>
Sec.  1215.111  User postponement of service.

The user may postpone the initiation of contracted service (e.g.,
user launch date) by delivery of written notification to NASA
Headquarters, Code OX. Any delay in the contracted start of service date
may affect the quantity of service to be provided due to commitments to
other support requirements. Therefore, the validity of previous
estimates of predicted support availability may no longer be applicable.

[56 FR 28049, June 19, 1991]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.112  User/NASA contractual arrangement.

No service shall be provided without an approved agreement.

[77 FR 6953, Feb. 10, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.113  User charges.

(a) The user shall reimburse NASA the sum of the charges for
standard and mission-unique services. Charges will be based on the
service rates applicable at the time of service.
(b) For standard services, the user shall be charged only for
services rendered, except that if a total cancellation of service
occurs, the user shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of
Sec.  1215.110.

[[Page 102]]

(1) Standard services which are scheduled, and then cancelled by the
user less than 72 hours prior to the start of that scheduled service
period, will be charged as if the scheduled service actually occurred.
(2) The time scheduled by the user project shall include the slew
time, set up and/or configuration time, TDRSS contact time, and all
other conditions for which TDRSS services were allocated to the user.
(3) Charges will be accumulated by the minute, based on the
computerized schedule/configuration messages which physically set up
TDRSS equipment at the start of a support period and free the equipment
for other users at the end of a support period.
(c) The user shall reimburse NASA for the costs of any mission-
unique services provided by NASA.

[77 FR 6953, Feb. 10, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.114  Service rates.

(a) Rates for TDRSS services will be established by the DAA for
SCaN.
(b) Per-minute rates will reflect TDRSS total return on investment
and operational and maintenance costs.
(c) The rate per minute by service and type of user is available on
the following Web site: https://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/
programs/Space_network.cfm.
(d) The per-minute charge for TDRSS service is computed by
multiplying the charge per minute for the appropriate service by the
number of minutes utilized.

[77 FR 6953, Feb. 10, 2012]


<r05>
Sec.  1215.115  Payment and billing.

(a) The procedure for billing and payment of standard TDRSS services
is as follows:
(1) NASA shall be reimbursed by customers in connection with the use
of Government property and services provided under an approved
reimbursable agreement. Advance payment for services is required.
Advance payments shall be scheduled to keep pace with the rate at which
NASA anticipates incurring costs. NASA will provide a Customer Budget/
Estimate (CBE) for services rendered nominally 60-90 days in advance, or
as otherwise agreed, of the first anticipated property use or required
service date for each mission. The full cost of the mission shall be
paid by the customer not later than 30 days prior to the first
anticipated property use or required service date.
(2) In some cases, an advance partial payment will be required six--
nine months prior to the first anticipated property use or required
service date in order for advance planning work and/or travel to take
place. The amount of this partial payment and its receipt shall be
negotiated on an as-needed basis. Adjustments to the amounts prepaid
will be made to the succeeding billings as the actual services are
rendered.
(3) If the customer fails to make payment by the payment due date,
NASA may terminate the agreement and any subagreements for breach of
agreement after notice to the customer is given of this breach and
failure to cure such breach within a time period established by NASA.
(b) Late payments by the user will require the user to pay a late
payment charge.

<r05>
Sec.  1216.301  Applicability.

This subpart applies to all organizational elements of NASA.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.302  Responsibilities.

(a) The NASA Senior Environmental Official (SEO) (as defined in
Appendix A to this subpart) is responsible for overseeing and guiding
NASA's integration of NEPA into the Agency's planning and decision
making. The SEO, with the assistance of the Office of the General
Counsel (OGC), is responsible for developing NASA NEPA regulations and
maintaining up-to-date Agency-wide NEPA guidance that fully integrates
NEPA analysis into Agency

[[Page 106]]

planning and decision-making processes. The SEO shall monitor this
process to ensure that these regulations and the associated Agency
guidance are achieving their purposes. In addition, the NASA SEO is
responsible for coordinating with other Federal agencies and the CEQ and
consolidating and transmitting NASA's comments on EISs and other NEPA
documentation prepared by other Federal agencies:
(1) The NASA Headquarters/Environmental Management Division (HQ/EMD)
is delegated the SEO's overall responsibility of implementing NEPA
functions and guiding NASA's integration of NEPA into the Agency's
planning and decision making for all NASA activities. The HQ/EMD
provides advice and consultation to all NASA entities in implementing
their assigned responsibilities under NEPA. Interested persons can
obtain information on the status of EISs and other elements of the NEPA
process by contacting the NASA NEPA Manager at HQ/EMD identified at
http://www.nasa.gov/agency/nepa/NEPATeam.html.
(2) Each NASA Center has an environmental management office that
guides and supports the working-level functions of the NEPA process,
such as evaluating proposed actions; developing, reviewing, and
approving required documentation; and advising project managers.
(b) The Responsible Official shall ensure that planning and decision
making for each proposed Agency action complies with these regulations
and with Agency NEPA policy and guidance provided by the SEO, HQ/EMD,
and the Center's environmental management office. For facility programs
and projects, the Responsible Official is the individual responsible for
establishing, developing, and maintaining the institutional capabilities
required for the execution of programs and projects (e.g., Center
Director, facility manager). For other programs and projects, (e.g.,
space flight programs/projects, R&amp;D programs/projects) the Responsible
Official is the NASA official responsible for the formulation and
implementation of the program or project (e.g., The Associate
Administrator for Science Mission Directorate, Center Director).
(c) NASA must comply with this subpart when considering issuance of
a permit, lease, easement, or grant to a non-Federal party and may seek
such non-Federal party's assistance in obtaining necessary information
and completing the NEPA process. The Responsible Official(s) for such
action(s), in consultation with HQ/EMD and/or the Center's environmental
management office, will determine the type of environmental information
needed from the non-Federal party and the extent of the non-Federal
party's participation in the necessary NEPA process.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.303  NEPA process in NASA planning and decision making.

(a) NEPA requires the systematic examination of the environmental
consequences of implementing a proposed Agency action. Full integration
of the NEPA process with NASA project and program planning improves
Agency decisions and ensures that:
(1) Planning and decision making support NASA's strategic plan
commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship and comply
with applicable environmental statutes, regulations, and policies.
(2) The public is appropriately engaged in the decision-making
process.
(3) Procedural risks and delays are minimized.
(b) Determining the appropriate level of NEPA review and
documentation for a proposed NASA action will depend upon the scope of
the action and the context and intensity of the reasonably foreseeable
environmental impacts.
(c) The environmental impacts of a proposed Agency action must be
considered, along with technical, economic, and other factors that are
reasonably foreseeable, beginning in the early planning stage of a
proposed action. NASA will take no action which would have an adverse
environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives
prior to completion of its NEPA review.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.304  Categorical exclusions.

(a) Categorical Exclusions (CatExs) are categories of Agency actions
with no individually or cumulatively significant impact on the human
environment and for which neither an EA nor

[[Page 107]]

an EIS is required. The use of a CatEx is intended to reduce paperwork,
improve Government efficiency, and eliminate delays in the initiation
and completion of proposed actions having no significant impact.
(b) A proposed action may be categorically excluded if the action
fits within a category of actions eligible for exclusion (such
categories are listed in paragraph (d) of this section)), and the
proposed action does not involve any extraordinary circumstances as
described in paragraph (c) of this section:
(c) Extraordinary circumstances that will preclude the use of CatExs
occur when the proposed action:
(1) Has a reasonable likelihood of having (individually or
cumulatively) significant impacts on public health, safety, or the
environment.
(2) Imposes uncertain or unique environmental risks.
(3) Is of significantly greater scope or size than is normal for
this category of action.
(4) Has a reasonable likelihood of violating Federal, federally
recognized Indian tribe, State, and/or local law or requirements imposed
for the protection of the environment.
(5) Involves impacts on the quality of the environment that are
likely to be environmentally controversial.
(6) May adversely affect environmentally sensitive resources, such
as, but not limited to, federally listed threatened or endangered
species, their designated critical habitat, wilderness areas,
floodplains, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, coastal zones, wild and
scenic rivers, and significant fish or wildlife habitat, unless the
impact has been resolved through another environmental review process;
e.g., the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).
(7) May adversely affect known national natural landmarks, or
cultural or historic resources, including, but not limited to, property
listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places,
unless the impact has been resolved through another environmental review
process; e.g., the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
(d) Specific NASA actions meeting the criteria for being
categorically excluded from the requirements for EAs and EISs are as
follows:
(1) Administrative Activities including:
(i) Personnel actions, organizational changes, and procurement of
routine goods and services.
(ii) Issuance of procedural rules, manuals, directives, and
requirements.
(iii) Program budget proposals, disbursements, and transfer or
reprogramming of funds.
(iv) Preparation of documents, including design and feasibility
studies, analytical supply and demand studies, reports and
recommendations, master and strategic plans, and other advisory
documents.
(v) Information-gathering exercises, such as inventories, audits,
studies, and field studies, including water sampling, cultural resources
surveys, biological surveys, geologic surveys, modeling or simulations,
and routine data collection and analysis activities.
(vi) Preparation and dissemination of information, including
document mailings, publications, classroom materials, conferences,

discussion with the CEQ.

[[Page 109]]


<r05>
Sec.  1216.305  Actions requiring environmental assessments.

(a) The Responsible Official will prepare an EA when a proposed
action cannot be categorically excluded, and the proposed action is not
expected to result in impacts that require analysis in an EIS. The
Responsible Official will consider the scope of the action and the
context and intensity of any environmental impacts when determining
whether to prepare an EA.
(b) Typical NASA actions normally requiring an EA include:
(1) Specific spacecraft development and space flight projects/
programs (as defined in Appendix A to this subpart).
(2) Actions altering the ongoing operations at a NASA Center which
could lead directly, indirectly, or cumulatively to substantial natural
or physical environmental impacts.
(3) Construction or modifications of facilities which are not minor.
(4) Proposed actions that are expected to result in significant
changes to established land use.
(5) A space flight project/program that would return
extraterrestrial samples to Earth from solar system bodies (such as
asteroids, comets, planets, dwarf planets, and planetary moons), which
would likely receive an Unrestricted Earth Return categorization (as
defined in Appendix A to this subpart) from NASA's Planetary Protection
Office (PPO) or the NASA Planetary Protection Subcommittee prior to the
return of samples to the Earth.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.306  Actions normally requiring an EIS.

(a) NASA will prepare an EIS for actions with the potential to
significantly impact the quality of the human environment, including
actions for which an EA analysis demonstrates that significant impacts
will potentially occur which will not be reduced or eliminated by
changes to the proposed action or mitigation of its potentially
significant impacts.
(b) Typical NASA actions normally requiring an EIS include:
(1) Development and operation of new launch vehicles or space
transportation systems.
(2) [Reserved]
(c) Development and operation of a space flight project/program
which would launch and operate a nuclear reactor or radioisotope power
systems and devices using a total quantity of radioactive material
greater than the quantity for which the NASA Nuclear Flight Safety
Assurance Manager may grant nuclear safety launch approval (i.e., a
total quantity of radioactive material for which the A2 Mission Multiple
(see definitions in Appendix A to this subpart) is greater than 10)).
(d) Development and operation of a space flight project/program
which would return samples to Earth from solar system bodies (such as
asteroids, comets, planets, dwarf planets, and planetary moons), which
would likely receive a Restricted Earth Return categorization (as
defined in Appendix A to this subpart) from the NASA Planetary
Protection Office or the NASA Planetary Protection Subcommittee.
(e) Substantial modification of a NASA facility's master plan in a
manner expected to result in significant effect(s) on the quality of the
human environment.
(f) Substantial construction projects expected to result in
significant effect(s) on the quality of the human environment, when such
construction and its effects are not within the scope of an existing
master plan and EIS.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.307  Programmatic EAs, and EISs, and tiering.

NASA encourages the analysis of actions at the programmatic level
for those programs similar in nature or broad in scope. Programmatic
NEPA analyses may take place in the form of an EA or EIS. These
documents allow ``tiering'' of NEPA documentation for subsequent or
specific actions.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.308  Supplemental EAs and EISs.

As detailed in CEQ regulations, supplemental documentation may be
required for previous EAs or EISs (see 40 CFR 1502.9). If changed
circumstances require preparation of a supplemental EA or EIS, such
document will be prepared following the same general process as the
original EA or EIS. No new scoping is required for a supplemental EIS;
however, NASA may choose to conduct scoping.

[[Page 110]]


<r05>
Sec.  1216.309  Mitigation and monitoring.

When the analysis proceeds to an EA or EIS and mitigation measures
are selected to avoid or reduce environmental impacts, such mitigation
measures will be identified in the EA/FONSI or the EIS Record of
Decision (ROD). NASA will implement mitigation measures (including
adaptive management strategies, where appropriate) consistent with
applicable FONSIs and/or RODs and will monitor their implementation and
effectiveness. The Responsible Official will ensure that funding
requests for such mitigation measures are included in the program or
project budget.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.310  Classified actions.

(a) Classification does not relieve NASA of the requirement to
assess, document, and consider the environmental impacts of a proposed
action.
(b) When classified information can reasonably be separated from
other information and a meaningful environmental analysis can be
produced, unclassified documents will be prepared and processed in
accordance with these regulations. Classified portions will be kept
separate and provided to properly cleared reviewers and decision makers
in the form of a properly classified document that meets the
requirements of these regulations to the extent permitted, given such
classification.


<r05>
Sec.  1216.311  Emergency responses.

(a) When the Responsible Official determines that an emergency
exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed actions before
preparing a NEPA analysis and any required documentation, in accordance
with the provisions in Sec. Sec.  1216.305 and 1216.307 of this subpart,
then the following provisions apply:
(1) The Responsible Official may take urgently needed actions that
are necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency needed
to mitigate harm to life, property, or resources. When taking such
actions, the Responsible Official shall, to the extent practical,
mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental impacts.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) At the earliest practicable time, the Responsible Official shall
also notify the SEO of the emergency situation and the action(s) taken.
The SEO will determine the appropriate NEPA action associated with the
urgent actions taken as a result of the emergency. If the urgent actions
will reasonably result in significant environmental impacts, the SEO
will consult with the CEQ to ensure compliance with 40 CFR 1506.11 as
soon as is reasonable.
(c) If the Responsible Official proposes emergency actions which
continue beyond the urgent actions taken as a result of the emergency,
and these actions are not categorically excluded, the Responsible
Official will consult with the SEO to determine the appropriate level of
NEPA compliance. If continuation of the emergency actions will
reasonably result in significant environmental impacts, the SEO will
consult with the CEQ to ensure compliance with 40 CFR 1506.11 as soon as
is reasonable.

<r05>
Sec.  1217.100  Scope.

This part sets forth policy and procedures with respect to the use
of the NASA's authority to certify to the U.S. Commissioner of Customs
duty-free entry of articles into the United States for the use of NASA
or for implementation of a NASA international program, including
articles that will be launched into space, spare parts for such
articles, ground support equipment, or uniquely associated equipment for
use in connection with a NASA international program or launch service
agreement. This part also sets forth NASA's procedures with respect to
the use of its authority to bring foreign-owned articles and articles
from space into the customs territory of the United States, and
describes the nonimport status of such articles.


<r05>
Sec.  1217.101  Applicability.

This part applies to qualifying articles entered or withdrawn from
warehouse for consumption in the customs territory of the United States,
and to articles brought into the customs territory of the United States
by NASA from space or from foreign country as part of the NASA
international program.


<r05>
Sec.  1217.102  Background.

In order to encourage and facilitate the use of NASA's launch
services for the exploration and use of space, section 116 of Public Law
97-446 provided for the duty-free entry into the United States of
certain articles imported by NASA for its space-related activities or
articles imported by another person or entity for the purpose of meeting
its obligations under a launch services agreement with NASA. Such
articles were certified by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs for duty-
free entry to be launched into space or space parts or necessary and
uniquely associated support equipment for use in connection with a
launch into space. This exemption from duty was provided for in
Subheading 9808.00.80, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). Also, HTSUS, Chapter VIII, U.S. note 1,
pursuant to the same law, provided that return of articles by NASA from
space to the United States would not be considered an importation, and
similarly not be subject to a duty.
As a result of the Uruguay Round agreements of the 1994 General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this authority was revised and expanded
in scope. It now provides that imports of articles for NASA's use and
articles imported to implement NASA's international programs, including
articles to be launched into space, parts thereof,

[[Page 112]]

ground support equipment, and uniquely associated equipment for use in
connection with NASA's international programs and launch service
agreements would be eligible for duty-free customs entry upon
certification by NASA to the Commissioner of Customs. The revised
authorities also provided, in U.S. note 1 to subchapter VIII of chapter
98 of the HTSUS, that articles brought into the customs territory of the
United States by NASA from space or from a foreign country as part of a
NASA's international programs would not be considered imports or subject
to customs entry requirements.

(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that
may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to
human subjects of research.
(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign
countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to
protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy.
In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that
the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are
at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or
agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in
lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when
otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or
agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in
the Federal Register or will be otherwise published as provided in
department or agency procedures.
(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may
waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy
to specific research activities or classes of research activities

Sec.  1230.102  Definitions for purposes of this policy.

(a) Certification means the official notification by the institution
to the supporting Federal department or agency component, in accordance
with the requirements of this policy, that a research project or
activity involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an
IRB in accordance with an approved assurance.
(b) Clinical trial means a research study in which one or more human
subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which
may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of the
interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.
(c) Department or agency head means the head of any Federal
department or agency, for example, the Secretary of HHS, and any other
officer or employee of any Federal department or agency to whom the
authority provided by these regulations to the department or agency head
has been delegated.
(d) Federal department or agency refers to a federal department or
agency (the department or agency itself rather than its bureaus, offices
or divisions) that takes appropriate administrative action to make this
policy applicable to the research involving human subjects it conducts,
supports, or otherwise regulates (e.g., the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the Central
Intelligence Agency).
(e)(1) Human subject means a living individual about whom an
investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:
(i) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or
interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the
information or biospecimens; or (ii) Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes,
or generates identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens.
(2) Intervention includes both physical procedures by which
information or

[[Page 128]]

biospecimens are gathered (e.g., venipuncture) and manipulations of the
subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research
purposes.
(3) Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact
between investigator and subject.
(4) Private information includes information about behavior that
occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no
observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been
provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual
can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record).
(5) Identifiable private information is private information for
which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by
the investigator or associated with the information.
(6) An identifiable biospecimen is a biospecimen for which the
identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the
investigator or associated with the biospecimen.
(7) Federal departments or agencies implementing this policy shall:
(i) Upon consultation with appropriate experts (including experts in
data matching and re-identification), reexamine the meaning of
``identifiable private information,'' as defined in paragraph (e)(5) of
this section, and ``identifiable biospecimen,'' as defined in paragraph
(e)(6) of this section. This reexamination shall take place within 1
year and regularly thereafter (at least every 4 years). This process
will be conducted by collaboration among the Federal departments and
agencies implementing this policy. If appropriate and permitted by law,
such Federal departments and agencies may alter the interpretation of
these terms, including through the use of guidance.
(ii) Upon consultation with appropriate experts, assess whether
there are analytic technologies or techniques that should be considered
by investigators to generate ``identifiable private information,'' as
defined in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, or an ``identifiable
biospecimen,'' as defined in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. This
assessment shall take place within 1 year and regularly thereafter (at
least every 4 years). This process will be conducted by collaboration
among the Federal departments and agencies implementing this policy. Any
such technologies or techniques will be included on a list of
technologies or techniques that produce identifiable private information
or identifiable biospecimens. This list will be published in the Federal
Register after notice and an opportunity for public comment. The
Secretary, HHS, shall maintain the list on a publicly accessible Web
site.
(f) Institution means any public or private entity, or department or
agency (including federal, state, and other agencies).
(g) IRB means an institutional review board established in accord
with and for the purposes expressed in this policy.
(h) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the
research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within
the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and
federal requirements.
(i) Legally authorized representative means an individual or
judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on
behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the
procedure(s) involved in the research. If there is no applicable law
addressing this issue, legally authorized representative means an
individual recognized by institutional policy as acceptable for
providing consent in the nonresearch context on behalf of the
prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s)
involved in the research.
(j) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
(k) Public health authority means an agency or authority of the
United States, a state, a territory, a political subdivision of a state
or territory, an Indian tribe, or a foreign government, or a person or
entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such
public agency, including the

[[Page 129]]

employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or persons
or entities to whom it has granted authority, that is responsible for
public health matters as part of its official mandate.
(l) Research means a systematic investigation, including research
development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute
to generalizable knowledge. Activities that meet this definition
constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are
conducted or supported under a program that is considered research for
other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may
include research activities. For purposes of this part, the following
activities are deemed not to be research:
(1) Scholarly and journalistic activities (e.g., oral history,
journalism, biography, literary criticism, legal research, and
historical scholarship), including the collection and use of
information, that focus directly on the specific individuals about whom
the information is collected.
(2) Public health surveillance activities, including the collection
and testing of information or biospecimens, conducted, supported,
requested, ordered, required, or authorized by a public health
authority. Such activities are limited to those necessary to allow a
public health authority to identify, monitor, assess, or investigate
potential public health signals, onsets of disease outbreaks, or
conditions of public health importance (including trends, signals, risk
factors, patterns in diseases, or increases in injuries from using
consumer products). Such activities include those associated with
providing timely situational awareness and priority setting during the
course of an event or crisis that threatens public health (including
natural or man-made disasters).
(3) Collection and analysis of information, biospecimens, or records
by or for a criminal justice agency for activities authorized by law or
court order solely for criminal justice or criminal investigative
purposes.

national security missions.
(m) Written, or in writing, for purposes of this part, refers to
writing on a tangible medium (e.g., paper) or in an electronic format.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.103  Assuring compliance with this policy--research conducted
or supported by any Federal department or agency.

(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this
policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under
Sec.  1230.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal
department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to
the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements
of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance,
individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a
current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file
with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor
office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the
existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring
submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by
this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made
to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor
office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support
research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an
assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as
provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to
the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and
approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by Sec.
1230.103(d)).
(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to
act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the
obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and
manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which
any assurance shall remain effective or

[[Page 130]]

otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.
(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a
Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under Sec.
1230.101(i) or exempted under Sec.  1230.104. For such research,
institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by
the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the
IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal
department or agency component supporting the research. Under no
condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to
receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and
approved by the IRB.
(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this
policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place
pursuant to Sec.  1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8))
that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted
by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and
the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's
reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the
responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance
with the requirements of this policy (e.g., in a written agreement
between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an
institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of
responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not
affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research
protocol).

<r05>
Sec.  1230.104  Exempt research.

(a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency
heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human
subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of
this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except
that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section
and as specified in each category.
(b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the
requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption
categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46,
subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:
(1) Subpart B. Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied
to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are
met.
(2) Subpart C. The exemptions at this section do not apply to
research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a
broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.
(3) Subpart D. The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6),
(7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to
subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs
(d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to
subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public
behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities
being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied
to research subject to subpart D.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the
following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this
policy:
(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted
educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational
practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity
to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who
provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special
education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of
or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or
classroom management methods.
(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational
tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures,
interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including
visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria
is met:
(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such
a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be
ascertained,

[[Page 131]]

directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the
research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or
civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing,
employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in
such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be
ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and
an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required
by Sec.  1230.111(a)(7).
(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in
conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject
through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or
audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the
intervention and information collection and at least one of the
following criteria is met:
(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such
a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be
ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the
research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or
civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing,
employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such
a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be
ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and
an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required
by Sec.  1230.111(a)(7).
(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral
interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically
invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the
subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will
find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such
criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would
include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve
puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to
allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and
someone else.
(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the
nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable
unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective
agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the
subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled
regarding the nature or purposes of the research.
(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary
research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:
(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens are publicly available;
(ii) Information, which may include information about biospecimens,
is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of
the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through
identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact
the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identify subjects;
(iii) The research involves only information collection and analysis
involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when
that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E,
for the purposes of ``health care operations'' or ``research'' as those
terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for ``public health activities
and purposes'' as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b); or
(iv) The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a Federal
department or agency using government-generated or government-collected
information obtained for nonresearch activities, if the research
generates identifiable private information that is or will be maintained
on information technology that is subject to and in compliance with
section 208(b) of the E-Government Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. 3501 note, if
all of the

[[Page 132]]

identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part
of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the
Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and, if applicable, the information
used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
(5) Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or
supported by a Federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the
approval of department or agency heads (or the approval of the heads of
bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority
to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are
designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public
benefit or service programs, including procedures for obtaining benefits
or services under those programs, possible changes in or alternatives to
those programs or procedures, or possible changes in methods or levels
of payment for benefits or services under those programs. Such projects
include, but are not limited to, internal studies by Federal employees,
and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative
agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise
mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A
of the Social Security Act, as amended.
(i) Each Federal department or agency conducting or supporting the
research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly
accessible Federal Web site or in such other manner as the department or
agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration
projects that the Federal department or agency conducts or supports
under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be
published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human
subjects.
(ii) [Reserved]
(6) Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance
studies:
(i) If wholesome foods without additives are consumed, or
(ii) If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or
below the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical
or environmental contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by
the Food and Drug Administration or approved by the Environmental
Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
(7) Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad
consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private
information or identifiable biospecimens for potential secondary
research use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the
determinations required by Sec.  1230.111(a)(8).
(8) Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research
involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following criteria are
met:
(i) Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary
research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens was obtained in accordance with Sec.  1230.116(a)(1)
through (4), (a)(6), and (d);
(ii) Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of
consent was obtained in accordance with Sec.  1230.117;
(iii) An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the
determination required by Sec.  1230.111(a)(7) and makes the
determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of
the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and
(iv) The investigator does not include returning individual research
results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not
prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return
individual research results.

Sec.  1230.107  IRB membership.

(a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be
sufficiently qualified through

[[Page 133]]

the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence),
and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural
backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to
promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights
and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the
acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments
(including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and
standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore
include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly
reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable
to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals
with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally
disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of
one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in
working with these categories of subjects.
(b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary
concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary
concerns are in nonscientific areas.
(c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
(d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
(e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with
competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that
require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB.
These individuals may not vote with the IRB.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.108  IRB functions and operations.

(a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB
shall:
(1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the
IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;
(2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members
identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications
of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to
describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB
deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each
member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time
employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or
unpaid consultant;
(3) Establish and follow written procedures for:
(i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for
reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the
institution;
(ii) Determining which projects require review more often than
annually and which projects need verification from sources other than
the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous
IRB review; and
(iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a
research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the
research activity in accordance with the terms of the IRB approval until
any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except
when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
(4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt
reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the
department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research
Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office
within the appropriate Federal department or agency of
(i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others
or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the
requirements or determinations of the IRB; and
(ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.
(b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described
in Sec.  1230.110), an IRB must review proposed

[[Page 134]]

research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the
IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns
are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it
shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the
meeting.

(a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research
activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities
under Sec.  1230.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of
exemption (under Sec.  1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7),
and (8)).
(b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or
legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of
informed consent is in accordance with Sec.  1230.116. The IRB may
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in
Sec.  1230.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and
welfare of subjects.
(c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may
waive documentation in accordance with Sec.  1230.117.
(d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing

Sec.  1230.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of
research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes
in approved research.

(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary
will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as
appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and
agencies and after publication in the Federal Register for public
comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human
Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.
(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the
following:
(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in
paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the
study involves more than minimal risk;
(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period
for which approval is authorized; or
(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of
exemption

[[Page 135]]

under Sec.  1230.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).
(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried
out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers
designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In
reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the
authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the
research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in
accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in Sec.
1230.108(b).
(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have
been approved under the procedure.
(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate,
or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the
expedited review procedure.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB
shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:
(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research
design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and
(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being
performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that
may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits,
the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result
from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying
knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible effects of the
research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall
within the purview of its responsibility.
(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the
setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves
a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue
influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired
decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged
persons.
(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and
to the extent required by, Sec.  1230.116.
(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or
appropriately waived in accordance with Sec.  1230.117.
(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.

privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of
Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and
agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in
assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of
subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(ii) [Reserved]
(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by
Sec.  1230.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at
paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the
following determinations:
(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research
use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is
obtained in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  1230.116(a)(1)-
(4), (a)(6), and (d);
(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of
documentation is appropriate, in accordance with Sec.  1230.117; and

Sec.  1230.112  Review by Institution

Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may
be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by
officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve
the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.113  Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.

An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported
promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and
the department or agency head.

Sec.  1230.114  Cooperative Research.

(a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this
policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of
cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying
with this policy.
(b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged
in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that
portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The
reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency
supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead
institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or
agency supporting the research.
(2) The following research is not subject to this provision:
(i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is
required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing
body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or
(ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting
or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a
single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.
(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an
institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a
joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make
similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.115  IRB Records.

(a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the
following:

evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample
consent forms, progress reports submitted by investigators, and reports
of injuries to subjects.
(2) Minutes of IRB meetings, which shall be in sufficient detail to
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research;
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their
resolution.
(3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale
for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would not
require continuing review as described in Sec.  1230.109(f)(1).

required by Sec.  1230.116(c)(5).
(8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under
Sec.  1230.110(b)(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review
list described in Sec.  1230.110(a) is more than minimal risk.
(9) Documentation specifying the responsibilities that an
institution and an organization operating an IRB each will undertake to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, as described in
Sec.  1230.103(e).
(b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at
least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall
be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The

of this section. General waiver or alteration of informed consent is
described in paragraph (f) of this section. Except as provided elsewhere
in this policy:
(1) Before involving a human subject in research covered by this
policy, an investigator shall obtain the legally effective informed
consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized
representative.
(2) An investigator shall seek informed consent only under
circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the legally
authorized representative sufficient opportunity to discuss and consider
whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of
coercion or undue influence.
(3) The information that is given to the subject or the legally
authorized representative shall be in language understandable to the
subject or the legally authorized representative.

(5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph
(d) of this section:
(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused
presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a
prospective subject or legally authorized representative in
understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate
in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and
presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.
(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in
sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and
presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts,
but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized
representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not
want to participate.
(6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through
which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to
waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases
or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or
its agents from liability for negligence.

(5) Unless the subject or legally authorized representative will be
provided details about specific research studies, a statement that they
will not be informed of the details of any specific research studies
that might be conducted using the subject's identifiable private
information or identifiable biospecimens, including the purposes of the
research, and that they might have chosen not to consent to some of
those specific research studies;
(6) Unless it is known that clinically relevant research results,
including individual research results, will be disclosed to the subject
in all circumstances, a statement that such results may not be disclosed
to the subject; and
(7) An explanation of whom to contact for answers to questions about
the subject's rights and about storage and use of the subject's

(e) Waiver or alteration of consent in research involving public
benefit and service programs conducted by or subject to the approval of
state or local officials--(1) Waiver. An IRB may waive the requirement
to obtain informed consent for research under paragraphs (a) through (c)
of this section, provided the IRB satisfies the requirements of
paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If an individual was asked to provide
broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use
of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens in
accordance with the requirements at paragraph (d) of this section, and
refused to consent, an IRB cannot waive consent for the storage,
maintenance, or secondary research use of the identifiable private
information or identifiable biospecimens.
(2) Alteration. An IRB may approve a consent procedure that omits
some, or alters some or all, of the elements of informed consent set
forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided the IRB
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. An IRB
may not omit or alter any of the requirements described in paragraph (a)
of this section. If a broad consent procedure is used, an IRB may not
omit or alter any of the elements required under paragraph (d) of this
section.

[[Page 140]]

(3) Requirements for waiver and alteration. In order for an IRB to
waive or alter consent as described in this subsection, the IRB must
find and document that:
(i) The research or demonstration project is to be conducted by or
subject to the approval of state or local government officials and is
designed to study, evaluate, or otherwise examine:
(A) Public benefit or service programs;
(B) Procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those
programs;
(C) Possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or
procedures; or
(D) Possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or
services under those programs; and
(ii) The research could not practicably be carried out without the
waiver or alteration.
(f) General waiver or alteration of consent--(1) Waiver. An IRB may
waive the requirement to obtain informed consent for research under
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, provided the IRB satisfies
the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. If an individual
was asked to provide broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and
secondary research use of identifiable private information or
identifiable biospecimens in accordance with the requirements at
paragraph (d) of this section, and refused to consent, an IRB cannot
waive consent for the storage, maintenance, or secondary research use of
the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.
(2) Alteration. An IRB may approve a consent procedure that omits
some, or alters some or all, of the elements of informed consent set
forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section provided the IRB
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section. An IRB
may not omit or alter any of the requirements described in paragraph (a)
of this section. If a broad consent procedure is used, an IRB may not
omit or alter any of the elements required under paragraph (d) of this
section.
(3) Requirements for waiver and alteration. In order for an IRB to
waive or alter consent as described in this subsection, the IRB must
find and document that:
(i) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
(ii) The research could not practicably be carried out without the
requested waiver or alteration;
(iii) If the research involves using identifiable private
information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not
practicably be carried out without using such information or
biospecimens in an identifiable format;
(iv) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights
and welfare of the subjects; and
(v) Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized
representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information
after participation.
(g) Screening, recruiting, or determining eligibility. An IRB may
approve a research proposal in which an investigator will obtain
information or biospecimens for the purpose of screening, recruiting, or
determining the eligibility of prospective subjects without the informed
consent of the prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized
representative, if either of the following conditions are met:
(1) The investigator will obtain information through oral or written
communication with the prospective subject or legally authorized
representative, or
(2) The investigator will obtain identifiable private information or
identifiable biospecimens by accessing records or stored identifiable
biospecimens.
(h) Posting of clinical trial consent form. (1) For each clinical
trial conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, one IRB-
approved informed consent form used to enroll subjects must be posted by
the awardee or the Federal department or agency component conducting the
trial on a publicly available Federal Web site that will be established
as a repository for such informed consent forms.
(2) If the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the
clinical trial determines that certain information should not be made
publicly available on a Federal Web site (e.g. confidential commercial
information), such Federal department or agency

[[Page 141]]

may permit or require redactions to the information posted.
(3) The informed consent form must be posted on the Federal Web site
after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60
days after the last study visit by any subject, as required by the
protocol.
(i) Preemption. The informed consent requirements in this policy are
not intended to preempt any applicable Federal, state, or local laws
(including tribal laws passed by the official governing body of an
American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that require additional
information to be disclosed in order for informed consent to be legally
effective.
(j) Emergency medical care. Nothing in this policy is intended to
limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care, to
the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal,
state, or local law (including tribal law passed by the official
governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe).

<r05>
Sec.  1230.117  Documentation of informed consent.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed
consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent
form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format)
by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A
written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent
form.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the
informed consent form may be either of the following:
(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of
Sec.  1230.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the
subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read
the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form
may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized
representative.
(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the
elements of informed consent required by Sec.  1230.116 have been
presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized
representative, and that the key information required by Sec.
1230.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other
information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written
summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized
representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to
the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the
subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the
witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and
the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary.
A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's
legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short
form.
(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to
obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it
finds any of the following:
(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would
be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential
harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or
legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject
wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the
subject's wishes will govern;
(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to
subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is
normally required outside of the research context; or
(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are
members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms
is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of
harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative
mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the
IRB may require the investigator to provide

[[Page 142]]

subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement
regarding the research.

<r05>
Sec.  1230.118  Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for
involvement of human subjects.

Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or
contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the
knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support,
but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or
proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants
when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility;
research training grants in which the activities involving subjects
remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement
will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or
purification of compounds. Except for research waived under Sec.
1230.101(i) or exempted under Sec.  1230.104, no human subjects may be
involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has
been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and
certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department
or agency component supporting the research.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.119  Research undertaken without the intention of involving
human subjects.

Except for research waived under Sec.  1230.101(i) or exempted under
Sec.  1230.104, in the event research is undertaken without the
intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to
involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be
reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a
certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or
agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to
the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.120  Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals
for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.

(a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and
proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department
or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department
or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency
head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into
consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection
against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the
subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be
gained.
(b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head
may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into
negotiations to develop an approvable one.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.121  [Reserved]


<r05>
Sec.  1230.122  Use of Federal funds.

be expended for research involving human subjects unless the
requirements of this policy have been satisfied.


<r05>
Sec.  1230.123  Early termination of research support: Evaluation of
applications and proposals.

(a) The department or agency head may require that Federal
department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended
in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the
department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to
comply with the terms of this policy.
(b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications
or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may
take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and
program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject
to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and
whether the applicant or the person or persons who

[[Page 143]]

would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects
of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency
head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection
of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research
was subject to federal regulation).


<r05>
Sec.  1230.124  Conditions.

With respect to any research project or any class of research
projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the
supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions
prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the
department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the
protection of human subjects.

(2) Information required. Each claim for medical monitoring,
diagnosis, and treatment under this program will be in writing and
include, at a minimum:
(i) Statement of eligibility describing the employment and
spaceflight history that justifies medical monitoring, diagnosis, and
treatment under this program;
(ii) History and diagnosis of medical or psychological condition;
(iii) Medical documentation in support of the claim. Healthcare
providers must be licensed and permitted to practice under state law and
not be on the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) List of
Excluded Individuals and Entities, found at: https://healthdata.gov/
dataset/list-excluded-individuals-and-entities;
(iv) Documentation of the decisions and/or payments made by the
primary payer (i.e., other U.S. Government agencies and/or private
health insurer) regarding the claim;
(v) Justification for determination that the psychological or
medical condition is associated with spaceflight;
(vi) Expenses for which they are seeking reimbursement, to include
documentation of all out-of-pocket costs; and
(vii) The signature of the eligible individual or their authorized
representative.
(3) Responsibility for perfecting claim. It is the responsibility of
the eligible individual, authorized representative, or the authorized
provider acting on behalf of the eligible individual to perfect a claim
for submission. NASA will assist eligible individuals with claims
submission, but is not authorized to prepare a claim on behalf of the
eligible individual.


<r05>
Sec.  1241.35  Claims review and decisions.

(a) NASA will establish the TREAT Astronauts Act Board (TAAB) to
review claims for medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment under
this program. This review is independent of any review conducted by
primary payers.
(b) The TAAB will review each claim submitted by the eligible
individual, in consultation with specialists, as appropriate. A typical
case will be reviewed within 30 calendar days, but cases that are more
complex may take additional time.
(c) The TAAB will make a recommendation to the Administrator or
designee for each claim stating whether the condition is determined to
be spaceflight associated.
(d) For those eligible individuals who have had other exposures in
addition to those experienced during their career as active U.S.
Government astronauts or payload specialists, the TAAB will consider
that history when making its recommendation.
(e) The NASA Administrator or designee will review each claim and
associated TAAB recommendation to determine whether the claim should be
approved or denied. A typical case can be reviewed within 30 calendar
days, but cases that are more complex may take additional time.
(f) The decision will be provided to the eligible individual within
seven calendar days of the final decision by the NASA Administrator or
designee. Decisions not in favor of the eligible individual will include
information on how to request reconsideration.
(g) An eligible individual or their authorized representative may
request reconsideration of the decision at any time if new information
is obtained that enhances the claim. Reconsideration requests can be
made to the JSC Flight Medicine Clinic.
(h) Requests for reconsideration are reviewed by the TAAB and
decisions made by the Administrator or designee, following the same
process described in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.


<r05>
Sec.  1241.40  Payment of approved claims.

(a) The NASA Administrator or designee is responsible for ensuring
that

[[Page 153]]

medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment to eligible individuals
under this program is paid only to the extent described in this part.
(b) Payment for medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment is
applied secondarily to primary payers and may include the remaining out-
of-pocket costs from primary payer coverage.

consistent with the Federal Travel Regulations.
(d) NASA may provide conditional payments for medical monitoring,
diagnosis, and treatment that is obligated to be paid by the U.S.
Government or other primary payers prior to a final decision by NASA in
accordance with Sec.  1241.35. Such requests for conditional payments
can be made to JSC Flight Medicine Clinic. Such payments are permitted
when payment for such medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment has
either not been made or will not be made promptly.
(1) NASA may seek to recover costs associated with conditional
payments from the U.S. Government, private health insurance company, or
other primary payer as allowable by law.
(2) If the claim is denied in accordance with Sec.  1241.35, NASA
may seek to recover such conditional payments from the eligible
individual in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37.


<r05>

Subpart 1_Patent Waiver Regulations

Authority: 51 U.S.C. 20135, 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.

Source: 52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.100  Scope.

This subpart prescribes regulations for the waiver of rights of the
Government of the United States to inventions made under NASA contract
in conformity with section 20135 of the National Aeronautics and Space
Act (51 U.S.C. Chapter 201).

[80 FR 19197, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.101  Applicability.

The provisions of the subpart apply to all inventions made or which
may be made under conditions enabling the Administrator to determine
that the rights therein reside in the Government of the United States
under section 20135(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act, 51
U.S.C. 20135(b)(1). The provisions do not apply to inventions made under
any contract, grant, or cooperative agreement with a nonprofit
organization or small business firm that are afforded the disposition of
rights as provided in 35 U.S.C. 200-204 (Pub. L. 96-517, 94 Stat. 3019,
3020, 3022 and 3023; and Pub. L. 98-620, 98 Stat. 3364-3367).

[80 FR 19197, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.102  Definitions and terms.

As used in this subpart:
(a) Contract means any actual or proposed contract, agreement,
understanding, or other arrangement with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) or another Government agency on NASA's
behalf, including any assignment, substitution of parties, or
subcontract executed or entered into thereunder, and including NASA
grants awarded under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 1891-1893.
(b) Contractor means the party who has undertaken to perform work
under a contract or subcontract.
(c) Invention means any, new and useful process, machine,
manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
thereof, or any variety of plant, which is or may be patentable under
the Patent Laws of the United States of America or any foreign country.
(d) Class of inventions means inventions directed to a particular
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a
narrowly drawn, focused area of technology.
(e) Made, when used in relation to any invention, means the
conception or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
(f) Practical application means to manufacture in the case of a
composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method,
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case,
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being
utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by law or
Government regulations available to the public on reasonable terms.
(g) Board means the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board
established by the Administrator of NASA within the Administration under
section 305(f) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as
amended (42 U.S.C. 2457(f)).
(h) Chairperson means Chairperson of the NASA Inventions and
Contributions Board.
(i) Petitioner means a contractor or prospective contractor who
requests that the Administrator waive rights in an invention or class of
inventions made or which may be made under a NASA contract. In the case
of an identified invention, the petitioner may be the inventor(s).
(j) Government agency includes any executive department, independent
commission, board, office, agency, administration, authority, Government
corporation, or other Government establishment of the executive branch
of the Government of the United States of America.
(k) Administrator means the Administrator of the National
Aeronautics and

[[Page 155]]

Space Administration or the Administrator's duly authorized
representative.

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19198, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.103  Policy.

(a) In implementing the provisions of section 20135(g) of the
National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. Chapter 201), and in
determining when the interests of the United States would be served by
waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in an
invention or class of inventions made in the performance of work under
NASA contracts, the Administrator will be guided by the objectives set
forth in the National Aeronautics and Space Act, by the basic policy of
the Presidential Memorandum and Statement of Government Patent Policy to
the Heads of the Executive Departments and agencies dated February 18,
1983, by the goals and objectives of its current Authorization Act,
Strategic Plan, and other pertinent National policies or laws, such as
the National Space Policy of the United States of America. Any such
waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the
Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the
interests of the United States. Among the most important goals are to
provide incentives to foster inventiveness and encourage the reporting
of inventions made under NASA contracts, to provide for the widest
practicable dissemination of new technology resulting from NASA
programs, and to promote early utilization, expeditious development, and
continued availability of this new technology for commercial purposes
and the public benefit. In applying this regulation, both the need for
incentives to draw forth private initiatives and the need to promote
healthy competition in industry must be weighed.
(b) Several different situations arise when waiver of all or any
part of the rights of the United States with respect to an invention or
class of invention may be requested and are prescribed in Sec. Sec.
1245.104 through 1245.106. Under Sec.  1245.104, advance waiver of any
or all of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention
or class of inventions which may be made under a contract may be
requested prior to the execution of the contract, or within 30 days
after execution of the contract. Waiver of rights to an identified
invention made and reported under a contract are to be requested under
Sec.  1245.105, and may be requested under this provision even though a
request under Sec.  1245.104 was not made, or if made, was not granted.
Waiver of foreign rights under Sec.  1245.106 may be requested
concurrently with domestic rights under Sec.  1245.104 or Sec.
1245.105, or may be made independently.
(c) With respect to inventions which may be or are made or conceived
in the course of or under contracts for research, development or
demonstration work awarded by NASA on behalf of the Department of Energy
(DOE) or in support of a DOE program, on a reimbursable basis pursuant
to agreement between DOE and NASA, the waiver policy, regulations, and
procedures of DOE will be applied. NASA will normally grant waiver of
rights to inventions made under contracts awarded by NASA on behalf of,
or in support of, programs funded by another Government agency, unless
the funding agency recommends and justifies denial of the waiver. See
Sec. Sec.  1245.110(c) and 1245.111(b).

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19197, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.104  Advance waivers.

(a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of
domestic rights of the United States with respect to any invention or
class of inventions which may be made under a contract.
(b) The NASA Inventions and Contributions Board normally will
recommend grant of a request for advance waiver of domestic rights
submitted prior to execution of contract or within 30 days after
execution of the contract unless the Board finds that the interests of
the United States will be better served by restricting or denying all or
part of the requested rights in one or more of the following situations:
(1) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does
not have a place of business in the United

[[Page 156]]

States or is subject to the control of a foreign government;
(2) When a determination has been made by Government authority which
is authorized by statute or Executive order to conduct foreign
intelligence or counter-intelligence activities that the restriction or
denial of the requested rights to any inventions made in the performance
of work under the contract is necessary to protect the security of such
activities; or
(3) Where the Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such
that restriction or denial of the requested rights will better promote
one or more of the following objectives:
(i) Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally
supported research and development;
(ii) Encouraging maximum participation of industry in federally-
supported research and development;
(iii) Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote free
competition and enterprise;
(iv) Promoting the commercialization and public availability of
inventions made in the United States by United States industry and
labor; and
(v) Ensuring that the Government retains sufficient rights in
federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and
protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.
(c)(1) An advance waiver, when granted, will be subject to the
reservations set forth in Sec.  1245.107. Normally, the reservations of
Sec.  1245.107(a), License to the Government, and Sec.  1245.107(b),
March-in rights, will apply. However, should one or more of the
situations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3), of this
section exist, rather than denying the advance waiver request, the Board
may recommend granting to the contractor only part of the requested
rights, to the extent necessary to address the particular situation,
consistent with the policy and goals of Sec.  1245.103. In that event,
the waiver grant will be subject to additional reservations as provided
for in Sec.  1245.107(c).
(2) To meet the National Aeronautics and Space Act standard of ``any
invention or class of inventions,'' for advance waivers, the petition
shall identify the invention(s) and/or class(es) of inventions that the
Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver
of rights is being requested. Therefore, the petition must be directed
to a specific invention(s) or to inventions directed to a particular
process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a
narrowly drawn, focused area(s) of technology.
(3) An advance waiver, when granted, will apply only to inventions
reported to NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and a
designation made within 6 months of the time of reporting (or a
reasonable time thereafter permitted for good cause shown) that the
contractor elects title to the invention and intends to file or has
filed a U.S. patent application. Such election will be made by
notification in writing to the patent representative designated in the
contract. Title to all other inventions made under the contract are
subject to section 20135(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space
Act, 51 U.S.C. 20135(b)(1). The granting of the advance waiver does not
otherwise relieve a contractor of any of the invention identification or
reporting requirements set forth in the applicable patent rights clause
in the contract.
(4) The advance waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in any
patent application filed on the reported invention, including any
subsequent divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the
claims of the subsequent application do not substantially change the
scope of the reported invention.
(d) When a petition for waiver is submitted under paragraph (b) of
this section, prior to contract execution, it will be processed
expeditiously so that a decision on the petition may be reached prior to
execution of the contract. However, if there is insufficient time or
insufficient information is presented, or for other reasons which do not
permit a recommendation to be made without unduly delaying execution of
the contract, the Board will inform the contracting officer that no
recommendation can be made prior to contract execution and the reasons
therefor. The contracting officer will then notify the petitioner of the
Board's action.

[[Page 157]]

(e) A waiver granted pursuant to a petition submitted under this
section shall extend to any contract changes, modifications, or
supplemental agreements, so long as the purpose of the contract or the
scope of work to be performed is not substantially changed.

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19198, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.105  Waiver after reporting inventions.

(a) The provisions of this section apply to petitions for waiver of
domestic rights to identified inventions which have been reported to
NASA and to which a waiver of rights has not been granted pursuant to
Sec.  1245.104.
(b)(1) When an individual identified invention has been reported to
NASA under the applicable terms of the contract and waiver of rights has
not been granted under Sec.  1245.104, the Board normally will recommend
grant of a request for waiver of domestic rights to such invention if
the request is received within 8 months of first disclosure to NASA (or
such longer period that the Board may permit for good cause shown),
unless the Board finds that one or more of the situations set forth in
Sec.  1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v) exist. When granted, the waiver will
be subject to the reservations set forth in Sec.  1245.107 in the same
manner as discussed in Sec.  1245.104(c)(1).
(2) The waiver shall extend to the invention claimed in the patent
application filed on the reported invention, including any subsequent
divisional or continuation application thereof, provided the claims of
the subsequent application do not substantially change the scope of the
reported invention.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.106  Waiver of foreign rights.

(a) The Board will consider the waiver of foreign rights in any
designated country concurrently with the waiver of domestic rights when
so requested under Sec.  1245.104 or Sec.  1245.105.
(b) The Board will also consider a separate request for foreign
rights for an individual identified invention in any designated country
if a request was not made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or
for countries not designated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The Board will normally recommend the waiver of foreign rights
be granted under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section in any
designated country unless:
(1) The Board finds that exceptional circumstances exist, such that
restriction or denial of the requested foreign rights will better
promote one or more of the objectives set forth in Sec.
1245.104(b)(3)(i) through (v); or
(2) The Board finds that the economic interests of the United States
will not be served thereby; or unless
(3) In the case of an individual identified invention under
paragraph (b) of this section, NASA has determined, prior to the
request, to file a patent application in the designated country.
(d) If, subsequent to the granting of the petition for foreign
rights, the petitioner requests and designates additional countries in
which it wishes to secure patents, the Chairperson may recommend such
request, in whole or in part, without further action by the Board.

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19199, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.107  Reservations.

(a) License to the Government. Any invention for which waiver of
domestic or foreign rights has been granted under this subpart shall be
subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable,
nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of
the invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States
or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the
United States.
(b) March-in rights. For any invention for which waiver of rights
has been granted under this subpart, NASA has the same right as set
forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210, with the procedures set forth in Sec.
1245.117 and 37 CFR 401.6, to require the contractor, an assignee, or
exclusive licensee of the invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially
exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible
applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the
circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee
refuses such a request, NASA

[[Page 158]]

has the right to grant such a license itself if NASA determines that:
(1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time,
effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in
such field of use;
(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs
which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or their
licensees;
(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not
reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by the
``Preference for United States industry'' has not been obtained or
waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any
invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
(c) Additional reservations. In the event one or more of the
situations set forth in Sec.  1245.104 (b)(1) through (b)(3) exist, the
Board may determine to recommend partial grant of the waiver request
(rather than denial) by making the grant subject to additional
reservations (than those set forth in (a) and (b) of this section) to
the extent necessary to address the particular situation. Such
additional reservations may include, but not be limited to, field-of-use
or terrestrial-use limitations, or additions to the march-in rights.

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19199, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.108  License to contractor.

(a) Each contractor reporting an invention is granted a revocable,
nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in
any country on the invention and in any resulting patent in which the
Government acquires title. The license extends to the contractor's
domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate
structure of which the contractor is a party and includes the right to
grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was
legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The
license and right is transferable only with the approval of the
Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of
the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
(b) The contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by
the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious
practical application of the invention pursuant to an application for an
exclusive license submitted in accordance with the Licensing of
Government-Owned Inventions (37 CFR part 404). This license will not be
revoked in that field of use and/or the geographical areas in which the
contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the
benefits of the invention available to the public on reasonable terms.
The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the
discretion of the Administrator to the extent the contractor, its
licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to
achieve practical application in that foreign country.
(c) Before revocation or modification of the license, the contractor
will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to
revoke or modify the license, and the contractor will be allowed 30 days
(or any other time as may be allowed by the Administrator for good cause
shown by the contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license
should not be revoked or modified. The contractor shall have the right
to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404,
any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.

[52 FR 43748, Nov. 16, 1987, as amended at 80 FR 19199, Apr. 10, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.109  Assignment of title to NASA.

(a) The instrument of waiver set forth in Sec.  1245.115(c) shall be
voided by NASA with respect to the domestic title to any invention for
which a patent application has not been filed within 1 year (or a
reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from notification to
NASA of election of title, as required by Sec.  1245.104(c)(2), for an
advanced waiver pursuant to Sec.  1245.104, or within 1 year from the
granting of a waiver for an individual invention granted pursuant to
Sec.  1245.105.

[[Page 159]]

(b) The instrument of waiver set forth in Sec.  1245.115(c) shall be
voided by NASA with respect to title in any foreign country for which
waiver has been granted pursuant to Sec.  1245.106, if a patent
application has not been filed in that country (or in the European
Patent Office or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and that country
designated) within either 10 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for
good cause shown) from the date a corresponding U.S. patent application
has been filed or 6 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good
cause shown) from the date a license is granted by the Commissioner of
Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such
filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
(c) In any country in which the waiver recipient decides not to
continue prosecution of any application, to pay maintenance fees on, or
defend in reexamination or opposition proceedings on a patent on a
waived invention, the waiver recipient shall notify the patent
representative within sufficient time for NASA to continue prosecution,
pay the maintenance fee or defend the reexamination or opposition, and
upon written request, convey title to NASA and execute all papers
necessary for NASA to proceed with the appropriate action.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.110  Content of petitions.

(a) Each request for waiver of domestic or foreign rights under
Sec.  1245.104, Sec.  1245.105, or Sec.  1245.106 shall be by petition

(1) An identification of the petitioner, its place of business, and
address;
(2) If the petitioner is represented by counsel, the name, address,
and telephone number of the counsel;
(3) A citation to the section (Sec.  1245.104, Sec.  1245.105, or
Sec.  1245.106) under which the petition is submitted, the nature and
extent of the rights requested, and a positive statement that waiver of
rights under the cited section is being requested;
(4) If the petitioner is an employee inventor of the contractor, a
statement from the contractor that the contractor does not object to
this petition.
(5) Information identifying the proposed contract or resulting
contract, if any;

<r05>
Sec.  1245.117  March-in and waiver revocation procedures.

(a) The exercise of march-in procedures shall be in conformance with
35 U.S.C. 203 and the applicable provisions of 37 CFR 401.6, entitled
``Exercise of march-in rights for inventions made by nonprofit
organizations and small business firms.''

Subpart 2_Claims for Patent and Copyright Infringement

Authority: 51 U.S.C. 20112-20113; 22 U.S.C. 2356; 35 U.S.C. 181-188
and 286; and 28 U.S.C. 1498.

Source: 77 FR 14687, Mar. 13, 2012, unless otherwise noted.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.200  Purpose.

The purpose of this subpart is to set forth policies and procedures
for the filing and disposition of claims of infringement of privately
owned rights in patented inventions or copyrighted works asserted
against NASA.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.201  Objectives.

Whenever a claim of infringement of privately owned rights in
patented inventions or copyrighted works is asserted against NASA, all
necessary steps shall be taken to investigate and to administratively
settle, deny, or otherwise dispose of such claim prior to suit against
the United States. The General Counsel, or designee, is authorized to
investigate, settle, deny, or otherwise dispose of all claims of patent
and copyright infringement, pursuant to the above-cited statutory
authority.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.202  Contents of communication initiating claim.

(a) Requirements for claim. A patent or copyright infringement claim
for compensation, asserted against the United States as represented by
NASA under any of the applicable statutes cited above, must be actually
communicated to and received by an organization, office, or within a
NASA Center. Claims must be in writing and must include the following:
(1) An allegation of infringement.
(2) A request for compensation, either expressed or implied.
(3) A citation to the patent(s) or copyright(s) alleged to be
infringed.
(4) In the case of a patent infringement claim, a sufficient
designation to permit identification of the accused subject matter (e.g.
article(s) or process(es)) alleged to infringe the patent(s), giving the
commercial designation, if known to the claimant, or, in the case of a
copyright infringement claim, the accused subject matter (e.g. act(s) or
work(s)) alleged to infringe the copyright.
(5) In the case of a patent infringement claim, a designation of at
least one claim of each patent alleged to be infringed or, in the case
of a copyright infringement claim, a copy of each work alleged to be
infringed.
(6) As an alternative to paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section,
certification that the claimant has made a bona fide attempt to
determine the accused subject matter, which is alleged to infringe the
patent(s), or the accused subject matter alleged to infringe the
copyright(s), but was unable to do so, giving reasons and stating a
reasonable basis for the claimant's belief that the patent(s) or
copyright(s) is being infringed.
(b) Additional information for patent infringement claims. In
addition to the information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the
following material and information generally are necessary in the course
of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are encouraged
to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to permit
rapid processing and resolution of the claim.
(1) A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all
claims of the patent(s) alleged to be infringed.
(2) Identification of all procurements known to the claimants that
involve the accused item(s) or process(es), including the identity of
the vendor(s) or contractor(s) and the Government acquisition activity
or activities.
(3) A detailed identification and description of the accused
article(s) or process(es) used or acquired by the Government,
particularly where the article(s) or process(es) relate to a
component(s) or subcomponent(s) of an item acquired, and an element-by-
element comparison of representative claim(s) with the accused
article(s) or process(es). If available, the identification and
description should include documentation and drawings to illustrate the
accused article(s) or process(es) in sufficient detail to enable
determining whether the claim(s) of the asserted patent(s) read on the
accused article(s) or process(es).

[[Page 164]]

(4) Names and addresses of all past and present licensees under the
patent(s) and copies of all license agreements and releases involving
the patent(s). In addition, an identification of all assignees of the
patent(s).
(5) A list of all persons to whom notices of infringement have been
sent, including all departments and agencies of the Government, and a
statement of the status or ultimate disposition of each.
(6) A brief description of all litigation involving the patent(s)
which was initiated at any time prior to the claim being filed and their
present status. This includes any defenses or counterclaims made and
positions maintained by opposing parties regarding invalidity of the
patent(s).
(7) A description of Government employment or military service, if
any, by the inventor(s) or patent owner(s) including a statement from
the inventor(s) or patent owner(s) certifying whether the invention
claimed in the patents was conceived or reduced to practice, in part or
in whole, during Government employment and whether such inventor(s) or
owner(s) occupied any position from which such inventor(s) or owner(s)
was capable of ordering, influencing, or inducing use of the invention
by the Government.
(8) A list of all contract(s) between the Government and
inventor(s), patent owner(s), or anyone in privity with the patent
owner(s), under which work relating to the patented subject matter was
performed.
(9) Evidence of title to the asserted patent(s) or other right to
make the claim.
(10) A copy of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
file history of each patent, if it is available to the claimant.
Indicate whether the patent has been the subject of any interference
proceedings, certification of correction request, reexamination, or
reissue proceedings at the USPTO, or lapsed for failure to pay any
maintenance fee. In addition, the status of all corresponding foreign
patents and patent applications and full copies of the same.
(11) Pertinent prior art known to the claimant not contained in the
USPTO file, for example, publications and foreign prior art. In addition
to the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the
investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused
article(s) or process(es) or to a specific acquisition (e.g. identified
contract(s)), it may speed disposition of the claim. Claimants are also
encouraged to provide information on any ancillary matters that may have
a bearing on validity or infringement.
(c) Denial for refusal to provide information. In the course of
investigating a claim, it may become necessary for NASA to request
information in the control and custody of the claimant that is relevant
to the disposition of the claim. Failure of the claimant to respond to a
request for such information shall be sufficient reason alone for
denying a claim.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.203  Incomplete notice of infringement.

(a) If a communication alleging patent infringement or copyright
infringement is received that does not meet the requirements set forth
in Sec.  1245.202(a), the sender shall be advised in writing by the
Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property:
(1) That the claim for infringement has not been satisfactorily
presented; and
(2) Of the elements necessary to establish a claim.
(b) A communication, in which no infringement is alleged in
accordance with Sec.  1245.202(a), such as a mere proffer of a license,
shall not be considered a claim for infringement.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.204  Indirect notice of infringement.

A communication by a patent or copyright owner to addressees other
than those specified in Sec.  1245.202(a), such as NASA contractors,
including contractors operating Government-owned facilities, alleging
that acts of infringement have occurred in the performance of a
Government contract, grant, or other arrangement, shall not be
considered a claim within the meaning of Sec.  1245.202(a) until such
communication meets the requirements specified therein.

[[Page 165]]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.205  Processing of administrative claims.

(a) Filing and forwarding of claims. All communications regarding
claims should be addressed to: Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property,
Office of the General Counsel, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001. If any communication relating
to a claim or possible claim of patent or copyright infringement is
received by an agency, organization, office, or field installation
within NASA, it shall be forwarded to the Agency Counsel for
Intellectual Property.
(b) Disposition and notification. The General Counsel, or designee,
shall investigate and administratively settle, deny, or otherwise
dispose of each claim. When a claim is denied, the Agency shall so
notify the claimant or the claimant's authorized representative and
provide the claimant with the reasons for denying the claim. Disclosure
of information shall be subject to applicable statutes, regulations, and
directives pertaining to security, access to official records, and the
rights of others.
(c) Termination of claims. If, while an administrative claim for
patent or copyright infringement is pending against NASA, the claimant
brings suit for patent or copyright infringement against the United
States in the Court of Federal Claims based on the same facts or
transactions as the administrative claim, the administrative claim shall
thereupon be automatically dismissed, with no further action being
required of NASA.

<r05>
Sec.  1245.301  Inventions under NASA contracts.

(a) Pursuant to Sec.  1245.113, NASA has facilitated the filing of
foreign patent applications by contractors by providing for the granting
of a waiver of title to a contractor to any identified invention in
countries other than the United States in the event the Administrator of
NASA does not desire to file a patent application covering the invention
in such countries. However, any such waiver is subject to the
reservation by the Administrator of the license required to be retained
by NASA under 51 U.S.C. 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space
Act, as amended.
(b) Conversely, where the principal rights in an invention made
under a NASA contract remain in the contractor by virtue of waiver,
Sec.  1245.19(a)(5) provides that the contractor, upon written request,
will convey to the Administrator of NASA the entire right, title, and
interest in the invention in any foreign country in which the contractor
has elected not to file a patent application.
(c) With respect to inventions in which NASA has acquired and
retained the principal rights, NASA will file patent applications in
countries other than the United States on inventions selected in
accordance with the criteria set forth in Sec.  1245.303.

[30 FR 1844, Feb. 10, 1965, as amended at 80 FR 42029, July 16, 2015]


<r05>
Sec.  1245.302  Inventions by NASA employees.

(a) The foreign rights of NASA and of the NASA employee making an
invention are determinable in accordance with Executive Orders 9865 and
10096 and Government Patent Board Administrative Order No. 6 issued
pursuant thereto.
(b) Where NASA acquires an assignment of the domestic rights in an
invention made by a NASA employee, NASA will also obtain an option to
acquire the foreign rights, including the right to file foreign patent
applications on the invention.
(c) Where NASA is entitled to only a governmental license in the
invention, the principal foreign rights in the invention are retained by
the employee

[[Page 166]]

unless he agrees in writing to assign such rights to NASA.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.303  Criteria.

The following categories of inventions will be considered for the
filing of patent applications by NASA in countries other than the United
States:
(a) Inventions which may be utilized abroad in governmental programs
of the United States.
(b) Inventions which may be exploited abroad in the public interest
by license to U.S. nationals or others.
(c) Inventions which may be utilized in applications type
satellites, such as communications and meteorological satellites.
(d) Inventions considered to be basic discoveries or of major
significance in an art.
(e) Inventions in fields which directly concern the public health or
public welfare.


<r05>
Sec.  1245.304  Procedures.

(a) The patent counsel at each NASA field installation will review
all invention disclosures at the time of docketing and will expedite the
processing and preparation of a U.S. patent application, if justified,
on those inventions which appear to fall within the criteria set forth
in Sec.  1245.303. The patent counsel will make a recommendation as to
whether or not foreign patent coverage appears justified at the time of
assigning a priority evaluation to a disclosed invention.
(b) Preparation and filing of patent applications in foreign
countries will be subject to approval of the Assistant General Counsel
for Patent Matters, NASA Headquarters.
(c) The Office of Assistant General Counsel for Patent Matters will
budget for and administer the filing of all patent applications in

<r05>
Sec.  1250.103  Discrimination prohibited.


<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-1  General.

No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color
or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any
program to which this part applies.


<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-2  Specific discriminatory acts prohibited.

(a) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or
through contractual or other arrangements, on ground of race, color, or
national origin:
(1) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit
provided under the program;
(2) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an
individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner,
from that provided to others under the program;
(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient
or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of
excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting
them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation
applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the
purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.
(4) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in
any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or
other benefit under the program;
(5) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any
advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service,
financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
(6) Treat an individual differently from others in determining
whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility,
membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet
in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit
provided under the program;

[[Page 169]]

(7) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program
through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an
opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under
the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as
an employee but only to the extent set forth in Sec.  1250.103-3).
(b) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial
aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any
such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in
which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will
be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be
afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not,
directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria
or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting
individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national
origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing
accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respects individuals
of a particular race, color, or national origin.
(c) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other
benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance
shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit
provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal
financial assistance.
(d) A recipient may not take action that is calculated to bring
about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly.
(e) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination
in this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in
Sec.  1250.103-1. This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of
race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove
or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have
restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race,
color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practices or
usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to
exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of,
or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to
which this regulation applies the applicant or recipient has an
obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the
consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to
accomplish the purpose of the Act.

[30 FR 301, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17936, July 5, 1973; 68 FR
51350, Aug. 26, 2003]


<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-3  Employment practices.

(a) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to
a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a
recipient may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements
subject an individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or
national origin in its employment practices under such program
(including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or
termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other
forms of compensation, and use of facilities), including programs where
a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is (1) to assist
such individuals through employment to meet expenses incident to the
commencement or continuation of their education or training, or (2) to
provide work experience which contributes to the education or training
of such individuals.
(b) Employment opportunities provided in connection with any of the
types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A, which
opportunities are limited, or for which preference is given, to
students, fellows, or other persons in training for the same or related
employments, are programs of the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) and
(2) of this section.
(c) The requirements applicable to construction employment under any
such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Executive Order
11246 or any Executive order which supersedes it.
(d) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is
not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race,
color, or national origin in the employment

[[Page 170]]

practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation
tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude
individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to
subject them to discrimination under any program to which this
regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section
shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other
persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure
equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of,
beneficiaries.

[30 FR 301, Jan. 9, 1965, as amended at 38 FR 17936, July 5, 1973; 68 FR
51350, Aug. 26, 2003]


<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-4  Illustrative applications.

(a) In training grant services discrimination is forbidden in the
selection or eligibility of individuals to be trained and in their
treatment by the grantee during their training. In any case where
selection is made from a predetermined group, such as the students in an
institution, the group must have been selected without discrimination.
(b) In a research or training grant to a university for activities
to be conducted in a graduate school, discrimination in the admission
and treatment of students in the graduate school is prohibited and the
prohibition extends to the entire university.
(c) Discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees
includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or
trainees in the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating,
recreational, or other facilities of the grantee or other recipient.
(d) In a research or training grant, discrimination is prohibited
with respect to the availability of any educational activity and any
provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to
individuals incident to the grant.
(e) Upon transfers of real or personal property for research or
educational uses, discrimination is forbidden to the same extent as in
the case of grants for the construction of facilities or the provision
of equipment for like purposes.
(f) In some situations even though past discriminatory practices
have been abandoned, the consequences of such practices continue to
impede the full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of
the applicant or recipient under Sec.  1250.105 to provide information
as to the availability of the program or activity, and the rights of
beneficiaries under this regulation, have failed to overcome these
consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient
to take additional steps to make the benefits fully available to racial
and nationality groups previously subjected to discrimination. This
action might take the form, for example, of special arrangements for
obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups
previously subjected to discrimination are adequately served.
(g) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used
discriminatory policies, the services and benefits of the program or
activity it administers may not in fact be equally available to some
racial or nationality groups. In such circumstances an applicant or
recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or
national origin to make the benefits of its program more widely
available to such groups, not then being adequately served. For example,
where a university is not adequately serving members of a particular
racial or nationality group, it may establish special recruitment
policies to make its program better known and more readily available to
such group, and take other steps to provide that group with more
adequate service.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-5  Special benefits.

An individual shall not be deemed subjected to discrimination by
reason of his exclusion from the benefits limited by Federal law to
individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin different
from his.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.103-6  Medical emergencies.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. Sec.  1250.103 to 1250.103-5,
a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have
failed to comply with Sec.  1250.103-1, if immediate provision of a
service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his
death or serious impairment of his health, and such service or other
benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution
which refuses or fails to comply with Sec.  1250.103-1.


<r05>
Sec.  1250.104  Assurances.

(a) General requirement. Every application for Federal financial
assistance to which this part applies, and every application for Federal
financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its
approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant
to the application, contain, be accompanied by, or identify and make
reference to, an assurance that the program will be conducted or the
facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or
pursuant to this part. If the assurance is not made a part of the
application, the application shall identify the assurance which is
applicable to the application. One assurance shall suffice for all
applications of an applicant if the assurance complies with the
conditions made applicable by this part to each such application for
Federal financial assistance. Every assurance shall include provisions
which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
(b) Duration of assurances. The period of time to be covered by the
assurances required under this Sec.  1250.104 shall be as follows:
(1) Real property. In the case of an application for Federal
financial assistance for providing real property or structures thereon,
the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or in the case of a
subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the
real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal
financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the
provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) Personal property. In the case of an application for Federal
financial assistance for providing personal property, the assurance
shall obligate the recipient for the period during which he retains
ownership or possession of the property.
(3) Other kinds of Federal financial assistance. In the case of an
application for any other kind of Federal financial assistance, the
assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which
Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application.
(c) Assurances for research, training, or educational programs. (1)
In the case of application by an institution of higher education or any
other organization for Federal financial assistance for a program or
activity which involves participation by students, fellows or trainees,
including but not limited to assistance for research, training, or the
provision of facilities, the assurance required by this Sec.  1250.104
shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating
to the treatment of students or other participants.
(2) The assurances from such an applicant shall be applicable to the
entire organization of the applicant.
(d) Assurances for construction of facilities. In the case of
assistance for the construction of a facility, or part thereof, the
assurance shall extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated
in connection therewith. In grants to assist in the construction of
facilities for the provision of research, training, or educational
services, assurances will be required that services will be provided
without discrimination, to the same extent that discrimination would be
forbidden as a condition of grants for the support of such services.
Thus, as a condition of grants for the construction of academic,
research or other facilities at institutions of higher education,
assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the
admission or treatment of students. Also, see paragraph (c) of this
section for the requirement as to the applicability of the assurance to
the applicant's organization.
(e) Instrument effecting or recording transfers of real property.
The instrument effecting or recording the transfer, shall contain a
covenant running

[[Page 172]]

with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the
real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial
assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of
similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved,
but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the
recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent
transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the
Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled
with a right to be reserved by NASA to revert title to the property in
the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the
responsible NASA official, such a condition and right of reverter is
appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and
to the nature of the grant and the grantee.
(f) Assurances for transfer of surplus real property. Transfers of
surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator
of General Services (41 CFR 101-6.2).
(g) Form of assurances. The responsible NASA officials shall specify
the form of assurances required by this Sec.  1250.104 and the extent to
which like assurances will be required by subgrantees, contractors and
subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other
participants in the program.
(h) Requests for proposals. Any request for proposals issued by NASA
which relates to covered financial assistance listed in appendix A shall
have set forth therein or have attached thereto the assurance prescribed
in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, and shall require that
the proposer either include the assurance as a part of his signed
proposal or identify and refer to an assurance already signed and
submitted by the proposer.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.105  Compliance information.

(a) Cooperation and assistance. Each responsible NASA official shall
to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in
obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and
guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
(b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and
submit to the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee timely,
complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form
and containing such information, as the Principal Compliance Officer or
his designee may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain
whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In
the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial
assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also
submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be
necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations
under this part.
(c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit
access by the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee during normal
business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources
of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain
compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient
is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or
person and that agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to
furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report
and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.
(d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient
shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other
interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this
part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient
receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information
available to them in such manner, as the Principal Compliance Officer
finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protection against
discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.106  Conduct of investigations.

(a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible NASA official or
his designee

[[Page 173]]

shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine
whether they are complying with this part.
(b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific
class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by
this part may by himself or by a representative file with the Principal
Compliance Officer or his designee a written complaint. A complaint must
be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the Principal
Compliance Officer or his designee.
(c) Investigations. The Principal Compliance Officer or his designee
will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report,
complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to
comply with this part. The investigation should include, where
appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the
recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with
this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to
whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.
(d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this
part, the Principal Compliance Officer or his designee will so inform
the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever
possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved
by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in Sec.
1250.107.
(2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the responsible NASA official or his
designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in
writing.
(e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or
other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against
any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or
privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he
has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner
in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The
identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent
necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct
of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising
thereunder.


<r05>
Sec.  1250.107  Procedure for effecting compliance.

(a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure
to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened
noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with
this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal
to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other
means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not
limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a
recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any
rights of the United States under any law of the United States
(including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other
contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State
or local law.
(b) Noncompliance with Sec.  1250.104. If an applicant fails or
refuses to furnish an assurance required under Sec.  1250.104 or
otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or
pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in
accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. NASA
shall not be obligated to provide assistance in such a case during the
pendency of the administrative proceedings under such subsection except
that NASA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such
proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an
application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.
(c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal
financial assistance. No order suspending, terminating or refusing to
grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective
until (1) the responsible NASA official has advised the applicant or
recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance
cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express
finding on the

[[Page 174]]

record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or
recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this
part, (3) the action has been approved by the Administrator pursuant to
Sec.  1250.109(e), and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the
Administrator has filed with the committee of the House and the
committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program
involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for
such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or
to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the
particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or
recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited
in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such
noncompliance has been so found.
(d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by
any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the Principal
Compliance Officer has determined that compliance cannot be secured by
voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of
its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance
and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such
notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least
10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or
other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action
as may be appropriate.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.108  Hearings.

(a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing
is required by Sec.  1250.107(c), reasonable notice shall be given by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected
applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or
recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision
under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the
matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either
(1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice
within which the applicant or recipient may request of the Principal
Compliance Officer that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2)
advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been
set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so
fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The
complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the
hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit
written information and argument for the record. The failure of an
applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to
appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be
a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and
Sec.  1250.107(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision
on the basis of such information as is available.
(b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at NASA
Headquarters in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the Principal
Compliance Officer unless he determines that the convenience of the
applicant or recipient or of NASA requires that another place be
selected. Hearings shall be held before the Administrator, or, at his
discretion, before a hearing examiner designated in conformity with 5
U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act).
(c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the
applicant or recipient and NASA shall have the right to be represented
by counsel.
(d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and
any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with
5 U.S.C. 554-557 (section 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and
in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not
inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing,
giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of
this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs,
requests for findings, and other related matters. Both NASA and the
applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all

[[Page 175]]

relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or
as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or
during the hearing.
(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings
conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to
assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject
testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably
necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may
exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All
documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be
open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to
refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A
transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the
substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be
based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
(e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or
related facts are asserted to constitute non-compliance with this part
with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other
means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which
this part applies, or non-compliance with this part and the regulations
of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title
VI of the Act, the Administrator may, by agreement with such other
departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of

<r05>
Sec.  1250.109  Decisions and notices.

(a) Decision by person other than the NASA Principal Compliance
Officer. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, such hearing
examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or
certify the entire record including his recommended findings and
proposed decision to the Principal Compliance Officer for a final
decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be
mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made
by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days
of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the
Principal Compliance Officer his exceptions to the initial decision with
his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Principal
Compliance Officer may on his own motion, within 45 days after the
initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he
will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such
notice of review the Principal Compliance Officer shall review the
initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the
reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of
review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the
Principal Compliance Officer.
(b) Decisions on record or review by the NASA Principal Compliance
Officer. Whenever a record is certified to the Principal Compliance
Officer for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing examiner
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the Administrator
conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given
reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written
statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the
Principal Compliance Officer shall be given in writing to the applicant
or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
(c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a
hearing is waived pursuant to Sec.  1250.108, a decision shall be made
by the Principal Compliance Officer on the record and a copy of such
decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to
the complainant, if any.
(d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or the
Principal Compliance Officer shall set forth his ruling on each finding,
conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement
or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with

[[Page 176]]

which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
(e) Approval by administrator. Any final decision of the NASA
Principal Compliance Officer which provides for the suspension or
termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial
assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this
part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Administrator, who
may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any
sanction imposed.
(f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension
or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial
assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and
may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are
consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this
part including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial
assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended
to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in
default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this
part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and
until it corrects its non-compliance and satisfies the Principal
Compliance Officer that it will fully comply with this part.
(g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient
adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this
section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal
financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that
order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with
this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully
comply with this regulation.
(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order
entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time
request the Principal Compliance Officer to restore fully the
eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request
shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or
recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
If the Principal Compliance Officer determines that those requirements
have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
(3) If the Principal Compliance Officer denies any such request, the
applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing,
specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall
thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the
record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the Principal
Compliance Officer. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such
eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the
requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings
under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order
issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.


<r05>
Sec.  1250.111  Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

(a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like
directions heretofore issued by any officer of NASA which impose
requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals
on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to
which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or
termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial
assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for
failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the
extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that
nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any
obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation,
order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of
this Instruction. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to
supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Orders 10925 and 11246 and regulations or instructions

[[Page 177]]

issued thereunder, or (2) any other regulations or instructions, insofar
as such other regulations or instructions prohibit discrimination on the
ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to
which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other
ground.
(b) Forms and instructions. Each responsible NASA official shall
issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and
detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as
applied to financial assistance to which this part applies and for which
he is responsible.
(c) Supervision and coordination. The Administrator may assign to
officials of other departments or agencies of the Government, with the
consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection
with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this
part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in Sec.
1250.109), including the achievement of effective coordination and
maximum uniformity within NASA and within the Executive Branch of the
Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar
programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination
made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or
agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this
subsection shall have the same effect as though such action has been
taken by the responsible official of this agency.

<r05>
Sec.  1250.112  Relationship with other officials.

NASA officials, in performing the functions assigned to them by this
part, are responsible for recognizing the delegations of authority and
responsibility of other NASA officials and for seeing the actions taken
or instructions issued by them are properly coordinated with the offices
and divisions having joint interests.

<r04>
Subpart 1251.1_General Provisions


<r05>
Sec.  1251.100  Purpose and broad coverage.

(a) Purpose. This part effectuates section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, which is designed to eliminate discrimination on the basis
of disability in any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.
(b) Broad scope of coverage. Consistent with the Americans with
Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008's purpose (ADA Amendments Act)
of reinstating a broad scope of protection under the ADA and section
504, the definition of ``disability'' applicable to this part shall be
construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage to the maximum extent
permitted by the terms of this part. The primary object of attention in
cases brought under this part should be whether entities covered under
section 504 have complied with their obligations and whether
discrimination has occurred, not whether the individual meets the
definition of disability. The question of whether an individual meets
the definition of disability under this part should not demand extensive
analysis.

[81 FR 3709, Jan. 22, 2016]

<r05>
Sec.  1251.103  Discrimination prohibited.

(a) General. No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the
basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity which receives Federal financial assistance.
(b) Discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient, in providing
any aid, benefits, or services, may not, directly or through
contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of
disability:
(i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
(ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity
to participate in or benefit from aid, benefit, or service that is not
equal to that afforded others;
(iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid,
benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others;

to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in
the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed
by others receiving an aid, benefit, or service.
(2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be
equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or
level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and individuals
without disabilities, but must

[[Page 181]]

afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the
same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of
achievement, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's
needs.
(3) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that no
individual with disability is denied the benefits of, excluded from
participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination in any
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance because of
the absence of auxiliary aids for individuals with impaired sensory,
manual, or speaking skills.
(4) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or
services provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny
a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate
in such programs or activities that are not separate or different.
(5) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration:
(i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with
disabilities to discrimination of the basis of disability;
(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially
impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or

both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are
agencies of the same State.
(6) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant
for assistance or a recipient may not make selections:
(i) That have the effect of excluding individuals with disabilities
from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to
discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal
financial assistance; or
(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially
impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or
activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.
(7) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided
under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance
includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility
that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased or rented, or
otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial
assistance.
(8) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that
communications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are
available to persons with impaired vision and hearing.
(c) Aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal law. The exclusion
of individuals without disabilities from aid, benefits, or services
limited by Federal statute of Executive order to individuals with
disabilities from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute
or Executive order to a different class of individuals with disabilities
is not prohibited by this part.

<r05>
Sec.  1251.104  Assurances required.

(a) Assurances. An applicant for Federal financial assistance to
which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified
by the Associate Administrator, that the program or activity will be
operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate
these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to NASA.
(b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial
assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real
property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the
recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for
the period during which the real property or structures are used for the
purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide
personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the
period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

[[Page 182]]

(3) In all other cases, the assurance will obligate the recipient
for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
(c) Covenants. (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in
the form of real property or interest in the property from NASA, the
instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant
running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during
which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal
financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the
provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is
purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient
shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(3) of
this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent
transfer of the property.
(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of
real property or interest in the property from NASA, the covenant shall
also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by NASA to
revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant.
If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise
encumber the real property as security for financing construction of
new, or improvement of existing facilities on the property for the
purposes for which the property was transferred, the Associate
Administrator may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to
accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems
appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title
for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains
effective.

[51 FR 26862, July 28, 1986, as amended at 68 FR 51351, Aug. 26, 2003;

<r05>
Sec.  1251.105  Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.

(a) Remedial action. (1) If the Associate Administrator finds that a
recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of disability
in violation of section 504 or this part, the recipient shall take such
remedial action as the Associate Administrator deems necessary to
overcome the effects to the discrimination.
(2) Where a recipient is found to have discriminated against persons
on the basis of disability in violation of section 504 or this part and
where another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has
discriminated, the Associate Administrator, where appropriate, may
require either or both recipients to take remedial action.
(3) The Associate Administrator may, where necessary to overcome the
effects of discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part,
require a recipient to take remedial action:
(i) With respect to individuals with disabilities who are no longer
participants in the recipient's program or activity but who were
participants in the program or activity when such discrimination
occurred; or
(ii) With respect to individuals with disabilities who would have
been participants in the program or activity had the discrimination not
occurred; or
(iii) With respect to individuals with disabilities presently in the
program or activity, but not receiving full benefits or equal and
integrated treatment within the program or activity.
(b) Voluntary action. A recipient may take steps, in addition to any
action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of
conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's
program or activity by qualified individuals with disabilities.
(c) Self-evaluation. (1) A recipient shall, within 1 year of the
effective date of this part; or within 1 year of first becoming a
recipient:
(i) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including
individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals
with disabilities, its current policies and practices and the effects
thereof that do not or may not meet the requirements of this part;
(ii) Modify, after consultation with interested persons, including
individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals

</r05><r05>
Sec.  1251.109  Effect of State or local law or other requirements
and effect of employment opportunities.

(a) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or
alleviated by the existence of any state or local law or other
requirement that, on the basis of disability, imposes prohibitions or
limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities

(a) This part does not require a recipient to permit an individual
to participate in or benefit from the services, programs, or activities
of that recipient when that individual poses a direct threat to the
health or safety of others.
(b) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to
the health or safety of others, a recipient must make an individualized
assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical
knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: The
nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the
potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable
accommodations in policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of
auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.

[81 FR 3711, Jan. 22, 2016]


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1251.111  Reasonable accommodation.

A recipient shall make reasonable accommodations in policies,
practices, or procedures when such accommodations are necessary to avoid

services where necessary to afford qualified individuals with
disabilities, including applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and
members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy
the benefits of, a program or activity of the recipient.

nature.
(2) Where the recipient communicates with applicants and
beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons
(TTY's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to
communicate with persons who are deaf or hard of hearing or have speech
impairments.
(c) This section does not require the recipient to take any action
that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative
burdens. In those circumstances where the recipient believes that the
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the
recipient has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  1251.112
would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance
would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the chief
executive officer of the recipient or his or her designee after
considering all of the recipient's resources available for use in the
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this

[[Page 185]]

section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the
recipient shall take any other action that would not result in such an
alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the
maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the
benefits and services of the program or activity.

employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant
or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or
speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or

(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from
conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided

opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to

Sec.  1251.549  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  1251.550, no qualified
individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's facilities are
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied
the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by
the agency.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1251.550  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

(a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This
paragraph does not--
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the
Agency to take any action that would threaten or destroy the historic
significance of historic properties.
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of
proving that compliance with Sec.  1251.550(a) would result in such
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be
accompanied by

[[Page 193]]

a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an
action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with
disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or
activity.
(b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily
accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section.
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified
individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting
appropriate.
(2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of
Sec.  1251.550(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals
with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic
property is not required because of Sec.  1251.550(a)(2) or (3),
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made
accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into
or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made
accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as
possible.
(d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with
disabilities or organizations representing individuals with
disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan
by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition
plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a
minimum--
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals
with disabilities;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the
facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during
each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the
plan.

Sec.  1251.551  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed,
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by
individuals with disabilities. The definitions, requirements,

[[Page 194]]

(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal
entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where
necessary to afford an individual with disabilities an equal opportunity
to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity
conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the
individual with disabilities.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices,
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal
nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate
with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and
facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary
entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  1251.560 would
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum
extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and
services of the program or activity.

according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1640 pursuant to section 501 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).

for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may
extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 195]]

(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government
entity.
(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to
and usable by individuals with disabilities.
(g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
(1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
(3) A notice of the right to appeal.
(h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or

Sec.  1252.100  What is the purpose of NASA's age discrimination
regulations?

The purpose of these regulations is to set out NASA's policies and

permit federally assisted programs or activities and recipients of
Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other
than age which meet the requirements of the Act and the governmentwide
regulations.

(ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
(iii) Describes intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-
related terms.

assistance.
(c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b)
of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.201  Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination.

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the terms normal
operation and statutory objective shall have the following meaning:
(1) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity
without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its
objectives.
(2) Statutory objective means any purpose of a program or activity
expressly stated in any Federal statute, state statute or local statute
or ordinance adopted by any elected, general purpose legislative body.
(b) Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or
activity. A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise
prohibited by Sec.  1252.200 if the action reasonably takes into account
age as a factor necessary to the normal operation of the achievement of
any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably
takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or
the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:
(1) Age is used as a measure of approximation of one or more other
characteristics; and
(2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in
order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue,
or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and
(3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or
approximated by the use of age; and
(4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly
on an individual basis.
(c) Reasonable factors other than age. A recipient is permitted to
take an action otherwise prohibited by

[[Page 199]]

Sec.  1252.200 which is based on a factor other than age, even though
that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different
ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the
factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal
operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a
statutory objective.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.202  Burden of proof.

The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls
within the exceptions outlined in Sec.  1252.201 (b) and (c) is on the
recipient of Federal financial assistance.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.203  Special benefits for children and the elderly.

If a recipient operating a program or activity provides special
benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions
shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program
or activity, notwithstanding the provision of Sec.  1252.10.

employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written
self-evaluation, in a manner specified by the responsible Agency
official, of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance from NASA to assess the
recipient's compliance with the Act.
(2) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the
NASA regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.303  Information requirements.

(a) Keep records in a form that contains information which NASA
determines may be necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is
complying with the Act and these regulations.
(b) Provide to NASA, upon request, information and reports which
NASA determines are necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is

against a recipient. The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to
determine whether a violation of these regulations has occurred.
(b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation
of the Act or these regulations, NASA will attempt to secure the
recipient's voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance
cannot be achieved, NASA will arrange for enforcement as described in

[[Page 200]]


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.401  Complaints.

the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of
discrimination. However, for good cause shown, NASA may extend this time
limit.
(b) NASA will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints
wherever possible, including taking the following measures:
(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement,
which identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first
had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action
or practice complained of, and assigned by the complainant.
(2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the
complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.
(3) Widely disseminating information regarding the obligations of
recipients under the Act and these regulations.

jurisdiction of these regulations, and will state the reason(s) why it
is outside the jurisdiction of these regulations.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.402  Mediation.

(a) Referral of complaints for mediation. NASA will refer to the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service all complaints that:
(1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and these regulations;
and
(2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.
(b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the
mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make
an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. There must be at
least one meeting with the mediator before NASA will accept a judgment
that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the
complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.
(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the
mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the
complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the
agreement to NASA. NASA will take no further action on the complaint
unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the
agreement. However, NASA retains the right to monitor the recipient's
compliance with the agreement.
(d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all
information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator
shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or
otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the
mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation
agency.
(e) NASA will use the mediation process for a maximum of 60 days
after receiving a complaint.
(f) Mediation ends if:
(1) 60 days elapse from the time NASA receives the complaint; or
(2) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, an agreement is reached;
or
(3) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines
that an agreement cannot be reached.
(g) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to NASA.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.403  Investigation.

(a) Informal inquiry. (1) NASA will investigate complaints that are
unresolved after mediation or are reopened because of a violation of a
mediation agreement.
(2) As part of the initial inquiry, NASA will use informal fact
finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the
complainant and

[[Page 201]]

recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, settle the complaint
on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. NASA may seek the
assistance of any involved State agency.
(3) NASA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the
parties and an authorized official at NASA.
(4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other
enforcement effort of NASA, including compliance reviews and
investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.
(5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a
recipient.
(b) Formal investigation. If NASA cannot resolve the complaint
through informal means it will develop formal findings through further
investigations of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a
violation of these regulations, NASA will attempt to obtain voluntary
compliance. If NASA cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin
enforcement as described in Sec.  1252.405.

[50 FR 13311, Apr. 4, 1985, as amended at 68 FR 51352, Aug. 26, 2003]

against any person who:
(a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or these
regulations; or
(b) Cooperates in any mediation, inquiry, hearing, or other part of
NASA's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.405  Compliance procedure.

(a) NASA may enforce the Act and these regulations through:
(1) Termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from
NASA under the program or activity involved where the recipient has
violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the
recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an
opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law
judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation, or prior to a
hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial
assistance from NASA.
(2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:
(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce
any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created
by the Act or these regulations.
(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or
local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a
violation of the Act or these regulations.
(b) NASA will limit any termination under Sec.  1252.405(a)(1) to
the particular program or activity NASA finds in violations of these
regulations. NASA will not base any part of a termination on a finding
with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not
receive Federal financial assistance from NASA.
(c) NASA will take no action under paragraph (a) until:
(1) The Administrator has advised the recipient of its failure to
comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that
voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
(2) 30 days have elapsed after the Administrator has sent a written
report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees
of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity
involved. The Administrator will file a report whenever any action is
taken under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) NASA also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance
from NASA to a recipient when a hearing under Sec.  1252.405(a)(1) is
initiated.
(1) New Federal financial assistance from NASA includes all
assistance for which NASA requires an application or approval, including
renewal or continuation of existing activities during the deferral
period. New Federal financial assistance from NASA does not include
assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under Sec.
1252.405(a)(1).
(2) NASA will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received
a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec.  1252.405(a)(1).
NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing
has begun within that time or the time for beginning the

[[Page 202]]

hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the
Administrator. NASA will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days
after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding
against the recipient.

</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.408  Remedial action by recipients.

(a) Where NASA finds a recipient has discriminated on the basis of
age, the recipient shall take any remedial action that NASA may require
to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient
exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, NASA may
require both recipients to take remedial action.
(b) Even in the absence of discrimination, a recipient may take
affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted
in limited participation in the recipients program or activity on the
basis of age.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.409  Alternate funds disbursal procedure.

(a) When NASA withholds funds from a recipient under these
regulations, the Administrator may disburse the withheld funds directly
to an alternate recipient.

demonstrate:
(1) The ability to comply with these regulations; and
(2) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute
authorizing the Federal financial assistance.

</r05><r05>
Sec.  1252.410  Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

(a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion
of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are
exhausted if:
(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint
and NASA has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
(2) NASA issues any findings in favor of the recipient.
(b) If NASA fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a
finding in favor of the recipient, NASA will:

(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil
action for injunctive relief; and
(3) Inform the complainant:
(i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in a United
States district court for the district in which the recipient is located
or transacts business;
(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right
to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's
fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint.
(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give
30 days notice by registered mail to the Administrator, the Attorney
General of the United States, and
(iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the act;
the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the
action; and, whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event
the complainant prevails; and
(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged
violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending
action in any court of the United States.

Recipients shall maintain on file for at least three years following
completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c) of this
section, and shall provide to the designated agency official upon

from

[[Page 206]]

the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency
official, that each education program or activity operated by the
applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply
will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An
assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be
satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or
recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take
whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with Sec.
1253.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or
to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior

Sec.  1253.120  Transfers of property.

If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in
whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that
operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the
fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer
properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor
and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the
provisions of Sec. Sec.  1253.205 through 1253.235(a).


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1253.125  Effect of other requirements.

(a) Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by
these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter,
obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive
Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive
Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive
Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive
Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order

Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil

(29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.
(b) Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The
obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or
alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would
render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of
any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any
occupation or profession.
(c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The
obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or
alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic
or other league, or association that would render any applicant or
student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or
participation of any applicant or student, on

[[Page 207]]

the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a
recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.


</r05><r05>
Sec.  1253.130  Effect of employment opportunities.

The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not
obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any
occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one
sex than for members of the other sex.

regulations. The recipient shall notify all its students and employees
of the name, office address, and telephone number of the employee or
employees appointed pursuant to this paragraph.

(a) Notification of policy. (1) Each recipient shall implement
specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and
employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school
students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and
employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding
collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient,
that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational
programs or activities that it operates, and that it is required by
Title IX and these Title IX regulations not to discriminate in such a
manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in
such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to
apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured
them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at
least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or
activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto
unless Sec. Sec.  1253.300 through 1253.310 do not apply to the
recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and
these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the
employee designated pursuant to Sec.  1253.135, or to the designated
agency official.
(2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by
paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or
of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient,
whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:
(i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by
student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such
recipient; and
(ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every
student and employee of such recipient.
(b) Publications. (1) Each recipient shall prominently include a
statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in
each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form that it makes
available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this
section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment
of students or employees.
(2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the
type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by
text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students,
or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is
permitted by these Title IX regulations.
(c) Distribution. Each recipient shall distribute without
discrimination on

[[Page 208]]

the basis of sex each publication described in paragraph (b)(1) of this
section, and shall apprise each of its admission and employment
recruitment representatives of the policy of nondiscrimination described

Sec.  1253.420  Access to schools operated by LEAs.

A recipient that is a local educational agency shall not, on the
basis of sex, exclude any person from admission to:

Sec.  1253.425  Counseling and use of appraisal and counseling materials.

(a) Counseling. A recipient shall not discriminate against any
person on the basis of sex in the counseling or guidance of students or
applicants for admission.
(b) Use of appraisal and counseling materials. A recipient that uses
testing or other materials for appraising or counseling students shall
not use different materials for students on the basis of their sex or
use materials that permit or require different treatment of students on
such basis unless such different materials cover the same occupations
and interest areas and the use of such different materials is shown to
be essential to eliminate sex bias. Recipients shall develop and use
internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate
on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other
instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members
of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the
recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that
such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument
or its application.
(c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a
particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of
individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is
necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of
discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials
or by counselors.

Sec.  1253.430  Financial assistance.

(a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
section, in providing financial assistance to any of its students, a
recipient shall not:
(1) On the basis of sex, provide different amounts or types of such
assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance that is of any
particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise
discriminate;
(2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of
facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency,
organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such
recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex;
or
(3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning
eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex
differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or
parental status.
(b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A
recipient may administer or assist in the administration of
scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance
established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or
similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that
require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified
therein; Provided, that the overall effect of the award of such sex-
restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial
assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
(2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use
procedures under which:
(i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the
basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability
of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
(ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other
form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
(iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was
selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the

assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
(c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards
athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable
opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to

employment available to any of its students:

person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment

accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of
its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or
provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would
violate Sec. Sec.  1253.500 through 1253.550 if it were provided to
employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient
from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different
proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family

concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital
status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.

discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its
education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular
activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false
pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the
student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the
program or activity of the recipient.
(2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the
certification of a physician that the student is physically and
emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a
certification is required of all students for other physical or
emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or
activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is
completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is
comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
(4) Subject to Sec.  1253.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy,
childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery
therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other

recipient's educational program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy
for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise
qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat
pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and
recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long
a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's
physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to
the status that she held when the leave began.

Sec.  1253.450  Athletics.

(a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from
another person, or otherwise be discriminated

[[Page 216]]

against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural
athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any
such athletics separately on such basis.
(b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph
(a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams
for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon
competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However,
where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for
members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of
the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have
previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to
try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact
sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports
include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and
other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily
contact.
(c) Equal opportunity. (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall
provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In
determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated
agency official will consider, among other factors:
(i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition
effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both
sexes;
(ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;
(iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;
(iv) Travel and per diem allowance;
(v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
(vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
(vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive
facilities;
(viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
(ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
(x) Publicity.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal
aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures
for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate
teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the
designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary
funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for
members of each sex.
(d) Adjustment period. A recipient that operates or sponsors
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the
elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from
September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors
interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the
secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this
section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three
years from September 29, 2000.

have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be
unavailable.

Sec.  1253.510  Recruitment.

(a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not
discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of
employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently

recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so
as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
(b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or
exclusively at entities that furnish as applicants only or predominantly
members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on
