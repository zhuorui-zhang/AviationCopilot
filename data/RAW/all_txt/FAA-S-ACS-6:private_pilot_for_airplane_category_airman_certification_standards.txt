# Foreword  

The U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Safety Standards,  Regulatory Support Division, Airman Testing Standards Branch, has published the Private Pilot for Airplane  Category Airman Certification Standards (ACS) to communicate the aeronautical knowledge, risk management,  and flight proficiency standards for private pilot certification in the airplane category, single-engine land and sea;  and multiengine land and sea classes.  

This ACS is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov .  

Comments regarding this ACS may be emailed to  acsptsinquiries@faa.gov .  

Material in FAA-S-ACS-6C supersedes FAA-S-ACS-6B, Private Pilot – Airplane Airman Certification Standards,  Change 1.  

The FAA created FAA-G-ACS-2, Airman Certification Standards Companion Guide for Pilots, to provide guidance  considered relevant and useful to the community. The number of appendices in the ACS was reduced and much  of the non-regulatory material was moved to the Airman Certification Standards Companion Guide for Pilots.  Applicants, instructors, and evaluators should consult this companion guide to familiarize themselves with ACS  procedures. FAA-G-ACS-2 is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov .

# Introduction  

# Airman Certification Standards Concept  

The goal of the airman certification process is to ensure the applicant possesses the knowledge, ability to manage risks,  and skill consistent with the privileges of the certificate or rating being exercised, in order to act as pilot-in-command (PIC).  

Safe operations in today’s National Airspace System (NAS) require the integration of aeronautical knowledge, risk  management, and flight proficiency standards. To accomplish these goals, the FAA drew upon the expertise of organizations  and individuals across the aviation and training community to develop the ACS. The ACS integrates the elements of  knowledge, risk management, and skill required for each airman certificate or rating. It thus forms a more comprehensive  standard for what an applicant must know, consider, and do to demonstrate proficiency to pass the tests required for  issuance of the applicable airman certificate or rating.

# Appendix 1: Practical Test Roles, Responsibilities, and Outcomes  

# Eligibility Requirements for a Private Pilot Certificate  

The prerequisite requirements and general eligibility for a practical test and the specific requirements for the original issuance  of a Private Pilot Certificate in the airplane category can be found in 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.39(a) and 61.103.  

In accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.39, the applicant must pass the airman knowledge test before taking the  practical test, if applicable to the certificate or rating sought.  

N ote:	 An applicant seeking to add an additional category or class to an existing certificate must comply with 14 CFR  section 61.63, as applicable.  

# Private Pilot Airplane Knowledge Test Table  

For an initial Private Pilot Certificate, applicants must pass the knowledge test listed in the table below as a prerequisite for  the practical test.  

![](images/669437db253b3106de0528d50f6267795f9a15fa10df851840a812ac360b1d11.jpg)  

# Use of the ACS During a Practical Test  

The practical test is conducted in accordance with the ACS and FAA regulations that are current as of the date of the test.  

The Areas of Operation in this ACS align with the Areas of Operation found in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.107(b). Each  Area of Operation includes Tasks appropriate to that Area of Operation. Each Task contains an Objective stating what  the applicant must know, consider, and/or do. The ACS then lists the aeronautical knowledge, risk management, and skill  elements relevant to the specific Task, along with the conditions and standards for acceptable performance. The ACS uses  Notes to emphasize special considerations.  

During the ground and flight portion of the practical test, the FAA expects evaluators to assess the applicant's mastery  of the topic in accordance with the level of learning most appropriate for the specified Task. The oral questioning will  continue throughout the entire practical test. For some topics, the evaluator will ask the applicant to describe or explain.  For other items, the evaluator will assess the applicant's understanding by providing a scenario that requires the applicant  to appropriately apply and/or correlate knowledge, experience, and information to the circumstances of the given scenario.  The flight portion of the practical test requires the applicant to demonstrate knowledge, risk management, flight proficiency,  and operational skill in accordance with the ACS.  

The elements within each Task in this ACS are coded according to a scheme that includes four components. For example,  PA.I.C.K2:  

PA = Applicable ACS  $|=$   Area of Operation C = Task  $\mathsf{K}\mathsf{Q}=$  Task element (in this example, Knowledge 2)  

There is no requirement for an evaluator to test every knowledge and risk management element in a Task; rather the evaluator  has discretion to sample as needed to ensure the applicant’s mastery of that Task. The required minimum elements to be  tested from each applicable Task include:  

•	 any elements in which the applicant was shown to be deficient on the knowledge test, as applicable; •	 at least one knowledge element; •	 at least one risk management element; and •	 all skill elements unless otherwise noted.  

N ote:	 The Airman Knowledge Test Report (AKTR) lists ACS codes that correlate to a specific Task element for a given  Area of Operation for any incorrect responses on the knowledge test.  

Knowledge and risk management elements are primarily evaluated during the knowledge testing phase of the airman  certification process. The evaluator administering the practical test has the discretion to combine Tasks/elements as  appropriate to testing scenarios.  

Unless otherwise noted in the Task, the evaluator must test each item in the skills section by observing the applicant perform  each one. As safety of flight conditions permit, the evaluator should use questions during flight to test knowledge and risk  management elements not evident in the demonstrated skills. To the greatest extent practicable, evaluators should test the  applicant’s ability to apply and correlate information and use rote questions only when they are appropriate for the material  being tested.  

If the Task includes a knowledge or risk element with sub-elements, the evaluator may choose the primary element and  select at least one sub-element to satisfy the requirement. Selection of the sub-element satisfies the requirement for one  element unless otherwise noted.  

For example, an evaluator who chooses PA.I.H.K1 may select a sub-element such as PA.I.H.K1e to satisfy the requirement  to select one knowledge element.  

The References for each Task indicate the source material for Task elements. For example, in the Task element “Acceptable  weather products and resources required for preflight planning, current and forecast weather for departure, en route, and  arrival phases of flight such as:” (PA.I.C.K2), the applicant should be prepared for questions on any weather product  presented in the references for that Task.  

The FAA encourages applicants and instructors to use the ACS when preparing for the airman knowledge tests and practical  tests. Evaluators must conduct the practical test in accordance with the current ACS and FAA regulations pursuant to 14  CFR part 61, section 61.43. If an applicant is entitled to credit for Areas of Operation previously passed as indicated on a  Notice of Disapproval of Application or Letter of Discontinuance, evaluators shall use the ACS currently in effect on the date  of the test.  

The ground portion of the practical test allows the evaluator to determine whether the applicant is sufficiently prepared to  advance to the flight portion of the practical test. The applicant must pass the ground portion of the practical test before  beginning the flight portion. The oral questioning will continue throughout the entire practical test.  

# Combined Private/Instrument Test  

Applicants for a combined Private Pilot Certificate with Instrument Rating, in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section  61.65(a) and (g), must pass all areas designated in the Private Pilot for Airplane ACS and the Instrument Rating – Airplane  ACS. Evaluators need not duplicate Tasks. For example, only one preflight demonstration would be required; however, the  Preflight Task from the Instrument Rating – Airplane ACS would be more extensive than the Preflight Task from the Private  Pilot for Airplane ACS to ensure readiness for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight. Applicants for a combined test must  present the applicable test reports.  

A combined certificate and rating evaluation should be treated as one practical test, requiring only one application and  resulting in only one temporary certificate, disapproval notice, or letter of discontinuance, as applicable. Failure of any Task  will result in a failure of the entire test and application. Therefore, even if the deficient maneuver was instrument related and  the performance of all visual flight rules (VFR) Tasks was determined to be satisfactory, the applicant will receive a notice  of disapproval.  

# Instructor Responsibilities  

The instructor trains and qualifies the applicant to meet the established standards for knowledge, risk management, and skill  elements in all Tasks appropriate to the certificate and rating sought. The instructor should use this ACS and its references  when preparing the applicant to take the practical test and when retraining the applicant to proficiency in any subject(s)  missed on the knowledge test.  

# Evaluator Responsibilities  

An evaluator includes the following:  

•	 Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI);  •	 Pilot examiner (other than administrative pilot examiners);  •	 Training center evaluator (TCE);  •	 Chief instructor, assistant chief instructor, or check instructor of pilot school holding examining authority; or  

•	 Instrument Flight Instructor (CFII) conducting an instrument proficiency check (IPC).  

The evaluator who conducts the practical test verifies the applicant has met the aeronautical experience requirements  specified for a certificate or rating before administering the test. During the practical test, the evaluator determines whether  the applicant meets the established standards of aeronautical knowledge, risk management, and skills for the Tasks in the  appropriate ACS.  

The evaluator must develop a plan of action (POA) that includes all required Areas of Operation and Tasks and administer  each practical test in English. The POA must include scenario(s) that evaluate as many of the required Areas of Operation  and Tasks as possible. As a scenario unfolds during the test, the evaluator will introduce problems and simulate emergencies  that test the applicant’s ability. The evaluator has the discretion to modify the POA to accommodate unexpected situations  as they arise or suspend and later resume a scenario to assess certain Tasks.  

Prior to and throughout the evaluation, the evaluator ensures the applicant meets the FAA Aviation English Language  Standard (AELS). An applicant must be able to communicate in English in a discernible and understandable manner with  air traffic control (ATC), pilots, and others involved in preparing an aircraft for flight and operating an aircraft in flight.  This communication may or may not involve radio communications. An applicant for an FAA certificate or rating issued in  accordance with 14 CFR parts 61, 63, 65, or 107 who cannot hear or speak due to a medical deficiency may be eligible for  an FAA certificate with specific operational limitations.  

If the applicant’s ability to meet the FAA AELS comes into question before starting the practical test, the evaluator will not  begin the practical test. An evaluator other than an ASI will check the box, “Referred to FSO for Aviation English Language  Standard Determination,” located on the bottom of page 2 of the applicant’s FAA Form 8710-1, Airman Certificate and/ or Rating Application, or FAA Form 8710-11, Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application - Sport Pilot, as applicable. The  evaluator will refer the applicant to the appropriate Flight Standards Office (FSO).  

If the applicant’s ability to meet the FAA AELS comes into question after the practical test begins, an evaluator who other  than an ASI will discontinue the practical test and check the box, “Referred to FSO for Aviation English Language Standard  Determination,” on the application. The evaluator will also issue FAA Form 8060-5, Notice of Disapproval of Application,  with the comment “Does Not Demonstrate FAA AELS” in addition to any unsatisfactory Task(s). The evaluator will refer the  applicant to the appropriate FSO. ASIs conducting the practical test may assess an applicant’s English language proficiency  in accordance with FAA Order 8900.1.  

In either case, the evaluator must complete and submit the application file through normal application procedures and  evaluators other than an ASI notify the appropriate FSO of the referral.  

If the ability of an FAA certificated airman comes into question prior to or during a required regulatory check (e.g., proficiency  check) the evaluator other than an ASI will not continue the check or provide an endorsement indicating completion. The  evaluator will refer the airman to the jurisdictional FAA field office for further determination of ability to meet the FAA AELS.  

For additional information, reference AC 60-28, FAA English Language Standard for an FAA Certificate issued under 14  CFR parts 61, 63, 65, and 107, as amended.  

The abbreviation(s) within parentheses immediately following a Task refers to the category and/or class airplane appropriate  to that Task. The absence of a class indicates the Task is for all classes. The meaning of each abbreviation is as follows:  

•	 ASEL—Airplane – Single-Engine Land •	 ASES—Airplane – Single-Engine Sea •	 AMEL—Airplane – Multiengine Land •	 AMES—Airplane – Multiengine Sea  

N ote:	 Note: When administering a test, the Tasks appropriate to the class airplane (ASEL, ASES, AMEL, or AMES)  used for the test must be included in the plan of action.  

# Possible Outcomes of the Test  

A practical test has three possible outcomes: (1) Temporary Airman Certificate (satisfactory), (2) Notice of Disapproval of  Application (unsatisfactory), or (3) Letter of Discontinuance.  

If the evaluator determines that a Task is incomplete, or the outcome is uncertain, the evaluator must require the applicant  to repeat that Task, or portions of that Task. This provision does not mean that instruction, practice, or the repetition of an  unsatisfactory Task is permitted during the practical test.  

# Satisfactory Performance  

Refer to 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43, for satisfactory performance requirements.  

Satisfactory performance will result in the issuance of a temporary certificate.  

# Unsatisfactory Performance  

If, in the judgment of the evaluator, the applicant does not meet the standards for any Task, the applicant fails the Task  and associated Area of Operation and the evaluator issues a Notice of Disapproval of Application. The evaluator lists the  Area(s) of Operation in which the applicant did not meet the standard, any Area(s) of Operation not tested, and the number  of practical test failures. The evaluator should also list the Tasks failed or Tasks not tested within any unsatisfactory or  partially completed Area(s) of Operation. 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(c)-(f) provides additional unsatisfactory performance  requirements and parameters.  

Typical areas of unsatisfactory performance and grounds for disqualification include:  

•	 Any action or lack of action by the applicant that requires corrective intervention by the evaluator to maintain safe  flight. •	 Failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques to clear the area before and while performing  maneuvers. •	 Consistently exceeding tolerances stated in the skill elements of the Task. •	 Failure to take prompt corrective action when tolerances are exceeded. •	 Failure to exercise risk management.  

The evaluator or the applicant may end the test if the applicant fails a Task. The evaluator may continue the test only with  the consent of the applicant. The applicant receives credit only for those Areas of Operation and the associated Tasks  performed satisfactorily.  

# Letter of Discontinuance  

Refer to 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(e)(2) for conditions to issue a letter of discontinuance.  

If discontinuing a practical test for reasons other than unsatisfactory performance (e.g., equipment failure, weather, illness),  the evaluator must return all test paperwork to the applicant. The evaluator must prepare, sign, and issue a Letter of  Discontinuance that lists those Areas of Operation the applicant successfully completed and the time period remaining to  complete the test to receive credit for previously completed Areas of Operation. The evaluator should advise the applicant to  present the Letter of Discontinuance to the evaluator when the practical test resumes in order to receive credit for the items  successfully completed. The Letter of Discontinuance becomes part of the applicant's certification file.  

# Time Limit and Credit after a Discontinued Practical Test  

Refer to 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.39(f) and 61.43(f) after issuance of a Letter of Discontinuance or Notice of Disapproval  of Application.  

# Additional Rating Task Table  

For an applicant who holds at least a Private Pilot Certificate and seeks an additional airplane category and/or class rating at  the private pilot level, the evaluator must evaluate that applicant in the Areas of Operation and Tasks listed in the Additional  Rating Task Table. The evaluator may evaluate the applicant’s competence in the remaining Areas of Operation and Tasks.  

If the applicant holds two or more category or class ratings at the private level, and the ratings table indicates different Task  requirements, the “least restrictive” entry applies. For example, if “All” and “None” are indicated for one Area of Operation,  the “None” entry applies. If the table indicates “B” and “B, C” the “B” entry applies.  

# Addition of an Airplane Single-Engine Land Rating to an Existing Private Pilot Certificate  

The table below indicates the required Tasks for each Area of Operation tested in accordance with this ACS.

\*Tasks C and D requirements do not apply to applicants who do not hold an instrument rating or who have previously  demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine airplane.  

# Addition of an Airplane Multiengine Sea Rating to an existing Private Pilot Certificate  

The table below indicates the required Tasks for each Area of Operation tested in accordance with this ACS.  

![](images/8f5d00b7207cfef1433e7869b845e8c0c92a42bdd17b130e61a0fdda1acc501b.jpg)

N ote:	 An applicant who holds a private airplane multiengine land rating without a center thrust limitation need not supply  a seaplane with propeller feathering capability when testing to add a private airplane multiengine sea rating.  

# Removal of the “Airplane Multiengine VFR Only” Limitation  

The removal of the “Airplane Multiengine VFR Only” limitation, at the private pilot certificate level, requires an applicant  to satisfactorily perform the following Area of Operation and Tasks from the Private Pilot for Airplane Category ACS in a  multiengine airplane that has a manufacturer’s published minimum control speed   $({\mathsf V}_{\mathsf{M C}})$  .  

X. Multiengine Operations Task C:	Engine Failure During Flight (by Reference to Instruments) (AMEL, AMES) Task D:	Instrument Approach and Landing with an Inoperative Engine (Simulated) (by Reference to  Instruments) (AMEL, AMES)  

# Removal of the “Limited to Center Thrust” Limitation  

Applicants who complete the practical test for the AMEL rating in an aircraft that does not have a manufacturer’s published   ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   receive a certificate with a “Limited to Center Thrust” limitation. When conducting a practical test for the purpose of  removing the “Limited to Center Thrust” limitation, the evaluator must test the applicant on the multiengine Tasks identified  in the table below in a multiengine airplane that has a manufacturer’s published  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   speed. This speed appears on the type  certificate data sheet (TCDS) or in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Removal of the limitation under 14 CFR parts 121,  135, or 142 occurs in accordance with an approved curriculum or training program. An applicant who holds an airplane  instrument rating and has not demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine airplane with a published   ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   shall  complete the additional Tasks listed under Removal of the “Airplane Multiengine VFR Only” Limitation section.  

IX. Emergency Operations Task E:	Engine Failure During Takeoff Before  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   (Simulated) (AMEL, AMES) Task F:	 Engine Failure After Liftoff (Simulated) (AMEL, AMES) Task G:	Approach and Landing with an Inoperative Engine (Simulated) (AMEL, AMES) X. Multiengine Operations Task A:	 Maneuvering with One Engine Inoperative (AMEL, AMES) Task B:	  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   Demonstration (AMEL, AMES)  

# Appendix 2: Safety of Flight  

# General  

Safety of flight must be the prime consideration at all times. The evaluator, applicant, and crew must be continually alert  for other traffic. If performing aspects of a given maneuver, such as emergency procedures, would jeopardize safety, the  evaluator will ask the applicant to simulate that portion of the maneuver. The evaluator will assess the applicant’s use of  visual scanning and collision avoidance procedures throughout the entire test.  

# Stall and Spin Awareness  

During flight training and testing, the applicant and the instructor or evaluator must always recognize and avoid operations  that could lead to an inadvertent stall or spin and inadvertent loss of control.  

# Use of Checklists  

Throughout the practical test, the applicant is evaluated on the use of an appropriate checklist.  

Assessing proper checklist use depends upon the specific Task. In all cases, the evaluator should determine whether the  applicant demonstrates CRM, appropriately divides attention, and uses proper visual scanning. In some situations, reading  the actual checklist may be impractical or unsafe. In such cases, the evaluator should assess the applicant's performance  of published or recommended immediate action “memory” items along with their review of the appropriate checklist once  conditions permit.  

In a single-pilot airplane, the applicant should demonstrate the crew resource management (CRM) principles described  as single-pilot resource management (SRM). Proper use depends on the specific Task being evaluated. If the use of the  checklist while accomplishing elements of an Objective would be either unsafe or impractical in a single-pilot operation, the  applicant should review the checklist after accomplishing the elements.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

A clear understanding of who has control of the aircraft must exist. Prior to flight, the pilots involved should conduct a briefing  that includes reviewing the procedures for exchanging flight controls.  

The FAA recommends a positive three-step process for exchanging flight controls between pilots:  

•	 When one pilot seeks to have the other pilot take control of the aircraft, they will say, “You have the flight  controls.” •	 The second pilot acknowledges immediately by saying, “I have the flight controls.” •	 The first pilot again says, “You have the flight controls,” and visually confirms the exchange.  

Pilots should follow this procedure during any exchange of flight controls, including any occurrence during the practical test.  The FAA also recommends that both pilots use a visual check to verify that the exchange has occurred. Doubt as to who is  flying the aircraft should not occur.  

# Use of Distractions  

Numerous studies indicate that many accidents have occurred when the pilot has been distracted during critical phases  of flight. The evaluator should incorporate realistic distractions during the flight portion of the practical test to evaluate the  pilot’s situational awareness and ability to utilize proper control technique while dividing attention both inside and outside  the flight deck.  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making, Risk Management, Crew Resource Management, and Single-Pilot Resource  Management  

Throughout the practical test, the evaluator must assess the applicant’s ability to use sound aeronautical decision-making  procedures in order to identify hazards and mitigate risk. The evaluator must accomplish this requirement by reference  to the risk management elements of the given Task(s), and by developing scenarios that incorporate and combine Tasks  appropriate to assessing the applicant’s risk management in making safe aeronautical decisions. For example, the evaluator  may develop a scenario that incorporates weather decisions and performance planning.  

In assessing the applicant’s performance, the evaluator should take note of the applicant’s use of CRM and, if appropriate,  SRM. CRM/SRM is the set of competencies that includes situational awareness, communication skills, teamwork, task  allocation, and decision-making within a comprehensive framework of standard operating procedures (SOP). SRM  specifically refers to the management of all resources onboard the aircraft, as well as outside resources available to the  single pilot.  

If an applicant fails to use aeronautical decision-making (ADM), including SRM/CRM, as applicable in any Task, the evaluator  will note that Task as failed. The evaluator will also include the ADM Skill element from the Flight Deck Management Task  on the Notice of Disapproval of Application.  

# Multiengine Considerations  

On multiengine practical tests, where the failure of the most critical engine after liftoff is required, the evaluator must consider  local atmospheric conditions, terrain, and type of aircraft used. The evaluator must not simulate failure of an engine until  attaining an altitude of at least 400 feet AGL and at least minimum single-engine speed   $({\sf V}_{\sf s s E})$  , best single-engine angle-of- climb speed   $(\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{x s E}})$  , or best single-engine rate-of-climb   $({\sf V}_{\sf v s e})$  .  

The applicant must supply an airplane that does not prohibit the demonstration of feathering the propeller in flight. However,  an applicant holding an unrestricted AMEL rating may take a practical test for the addition of an AMES rating in an AMES  without propeller feathering capability. Practical tests conducted in a flight simulation training device (FSTD) can only be  accomplished as part of an approved curriculum or training program pursuant to 14 CFR part 61, section 61.64. Any  limitations or powerplant failure will be noted in that program.  

For safety reasons, when the practical test is conducted in an airplane, the applicant must perform Tasks that require  feathering or shutdown only under conditions and at a position and altitude where it is possible to make a safe landing on  an established airport if there is difficulty in unfeathering the propeller or restarting the engine. The evaluator must select  an entry altitude that will allow the single-engine demonstration Tasks to be completed no lower than 3,000 feet AGL or  the manufacturer’s recommended altitude (whichever is higher). If it is not possible to unfeather the propeller or restart the  engine while airborne, the applicant and the evaluator should treat the situation as an emergency. At altitudes lower than  3,000 feet AGL, engine failure should be simulated by reducing throttle to idle and then establishing zero thrust.  

Engine failure (simulated) during takeoff should be accomplished prior to reaching 50 percent of the calculated  ${\sf V}_{\sf M C}$  

# Single-Engine Considerations  

For safety reasons, the evaluator will not request a simulated powerplant failure in a single-engine airplane unless it is  possible to safely complete a landing.  

# Appendix 3: Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations  

# Aircraft Requirements & Limitations  

If the multiengine airplane used for the practical test does not publish a  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$  , then the “Limited to Center Thrust” limitation  will be added to the certificate issued from this check, unless the applicant has previously demonstrated competence in a  multiengine airplane with a published  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$  .  

If the aircraft has inoperative equipment and can be operated in accordance with 14 CFR part 91, section 91.213,  it must  be determined if any inoperative instruments or equipment are required to complete the practical test. The inoperative  equipment must not interfere with practical test requirements.  

# Equipment Requirements & Limitations  

The aircraft must meet the requirements as outlined in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.45.  

To assist in management of the aircraft during the practical test, the applicant is expected to demonstrate automation  management skills by utilizing installed, available, or airborne equipment such as autopilot, avionics and systems displays,  and/or a flight management system (FMS). The evaluator is expected to test the applicant’s knowledge of the systems that  are available or installed and operative during both the ground and flight portions of the practical test. If the applicant has  trained using a portable electronic flight bag (EFB) to display charts and data and wishes to use the EFB during the practical  test, the applicant is expected to demonstrate appropriate knowledge, risk management, and skill appropriate to its use.  

If the practical test involves maneuvering the aircraft solely by reference to instruments, the applicant is required by 14 CFR  part 61, section 61.45(d)(2) to provide an appropriate view limiting device acceptable to the Administrator. The applicant  and the evaluator should establish a procedure as to when and how this device should be donned and removed and brief  this procedure before the flight. This device must prevent the applicant from having visual reference outside the aircraft,  but it must not restrict the evaluator’s ability to see and avoid other traffic. The use of the device does not apply to specific  elements within a Task when there is a requirement for visual references.  

# Use of Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD)  

Applicants for a pilot certificate or rating can accomplish all or part of a practical test or proficiency check in an FSTD qualified  under 14 CFR part 60, which includes full flight simulators (FFS) or flight training devices (FTD), only when conducted within  an FAA-approved training program. Each operational rule part identifies additional requirements for the approval and use of  FSTDs in an FAA-approved training program.  

# Credit for Pilot Time in an FSTD  

14 CFR part 61 and part 141 specify the minimum experience requirements for each certificate or rating sought. 14 CFR part  61 and the appendices to part 141 specify the maximum amount of FFS or FTD flight training time an applicant can apply  toward those experience requirements.  

# Use of Aviation Training Devices (ATD)  

Applicants for a pilot certificate or rating cannot use an ATD to accomplish a practical test, a 14 CFR part 61, section 61.58  proficiency check, or the flight portion of a 14 CFR part 61, section 61.57 flight review. An ATD is defined in 14 CFR part 61,  section 61.1.  

The FAA’s General Aviation and Commercial Division evaluates and approves ATDs as permitted under 14 CFR part 61,  section 61.4(c) and FAA Order 8900.1. Each ATD is then issued an FAA letter of authorization (LOA) that is valid for 60  calendar months. The LOA for each ATD lists the pilot time credit allowances and associated limitations.  

The Pilot Training and Certification Group public website provides  a list of the FAA-approved ATDs  and the associated  manufacturer.  

# Credit for Pilot Time in an ATD  

14 CFR part 61 and part 141 specify the minimum experience requirements for each certificate or rating sought. 14 CFR  part 61 and the appendices to part 141 specify the maximum amount of ATD flight training time an applicant can apply  toward those experience requirements. The LOA for each FAA-approved ATD lists the pilot time credit allowances and the  associated limitations.  

Evaluators must request an applicant to provide a copy of the manufacturer's LOA when using ATD flight training time credit  to meet the minimum experience requirements for an airman pilot certificate, rating, or privilege.  

# Operational Requirements, Limitations, & Task Information  

# VII. Slow Flight and Stalls  

Task A. Maneuvering During Slow Flight  

Evaluation criteria for this Task should recognize that environmental factors (e.g., turbulence) may result in a momentary  activation of stall warning indicators such as the stall horn. If the applicant recognizes the stall warning indication and  promptly makes an appropriate correction, a momentary activation does not constitute unsatisfactory performance on this  Task. As with other Tasks, unsatisfactory performance would arise from an applicant’s continual deviation from the standard,  lack of correction, and/or lack of recognition.  

Task B. Power-Off Stalls  

Evaluation criteria for a recovery from an approach to stall should not mandate a predetermined value for altitude loss and  should not mandate maintaining altitude during recovery. Proper evaluation criteria should consider the multitude of external  and internal variables that affect the recovery altitude.  

Task C. Power-On Stalls  

In some high-performance airplanes, the power setting may have to be reduced below the ACS guidelines power setting to  prevent pitch attitudes greater than  $30^{\circ}$   nose up. Evaluation criteria for a recovery from an approach to stall does not mandate  a predetermined value for altitude loss and does not mandate maintaining altitude during recovery. Proper evaluation criteria  considers the multitude of external and internal variables that affect the recovery altitude.  

# IX. Emergency Operations  

Task D. Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

For airplanes that include a ballistic parachute, applicants must follow the manufacturer’s procedures for arming and  disarming the system before and after flight. Testing of an applicant’s knowledge regarding how and when to use the system  and how to manage associated risks may include simulation and briefing of procedures but not actual deployment of the  system.  

Task E. Engine Failure During Takeoff Before  $V_{\l_{M C}}$   (Simulated) [Airplane, Multiengine Land (AMEL); Airplane Multiengine  Sea (AMES)]  

Engine failure (simulated) during takeoff should be accomplished prior to reaching 50 percent of the calculated  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$  .  

Task F. Engine Failure After Liftoff (Simulated) (AMEL, AMES)  

The evaluator must not simulate failure of an engine until attaining an altitude of at least 400 feet AGL and at least minimum  single-engine speed   $({\sf V}_{\sf s s E})$  , best single-engine angle-of-climb speed   $(\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{x s E}})$  , or best single-engine rate-of-climb   $({\sf V}_{\sf v s e})$  .  

# X. Multiengine Operations  

Task B.  $V_{_{M C}}$   Demonstration (AMEL, AMES)  

Airplanes with normally aspirated engines will lose power as altitude increases because of the reduced density of the  air entering the induction system of the engine. This loss of power will result in a  ${\mathsf{V}}_{\mathsf{M C}}$   lower than the stall speed at higher  altitudes. Therefore, recovery should be made at the first indication of loss of directional control, stall warning, or buffet. Do  not perform this maneuver by increasing the pitch attitude to a high angle with both engines operating and then reducing  power on the critical engine. This technique is hazardous and may result in loss of airplane control.  

Task C. One Engine Inoperative (Simulated) (solely by Reference to Instruments) During Straight-and-Level Flight and  Turns (AMEL, AMES)  

This Task is not required if an instrument-rated applicant has previously demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine  airplane, or if the applicant does not hold an Instrument Airplane Rating. If an applicant holds both a single- and multiengine  rating on a pilot certificate, but has not demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine aircraft, that airman’s certificate  must bear a limitation indicating that multiengine flight is permitted in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions only.  

Task D. Instrument Approach and Landing with an Inoperative Engine (Simulated) (solely by Reference to Instruments)  (AMEL, AMES)  

This Task is not required if an instrument-rated applicant has previously demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine  airplane, or if the applicant does not hold an Instrument Airplane Rating. If an applicant holds both a single- and multiengine  rating on a pilot certificate, but has not demonstrated instrument proficiency in a multiengine aircraft, that airman’s certificate  must bear a limitation indicating that multiengine flight is permitted in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions only.
