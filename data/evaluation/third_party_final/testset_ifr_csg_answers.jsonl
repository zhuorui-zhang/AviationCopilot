The altimeter and VSI are level and the attitude indicator shows a 2˚ nose up attitude. You also notice a bumpiness that you think could be pre-stall buffet. Does this change your assessment as to which instrument is failed?", "answer": "No. It is most likely just light turbulence. Because the attitude indicator, altimeter and VSI are all in agreement, it is highly unlikely that the error is not with the pitot tube.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Breaking either the VSI or altimeter would create a make-shift static alternate source. Why is it usually better to break the VSI?", "answer": "The VSI is generally less critical of an instrument and cheaper to replace.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why does use of an alternate static source cause slightly higher-than-normal altitude and VSI indications?", "answer": "The cockpit of unpressurized airplanes are not air-tight.

{"question": "You are 15 miles from a large thunderstorm at your twelve o’clock. Should you exercise your emergency authority to avoid it? Why or why not?", "answer": "Not yet. You have time to request a deviation from ATC.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between requesting something from ATC and using your emergency authority?", "answer": "When you use emergency authority you are not necessarily adhering to ATC instructions. You are doing what needs to be done in the interest of safety.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Are there times when you could simultaneously involve ATC and exercise PIC authority?", "answer": "Yes. One example would be initiating an emergency descent (emergency authority) for a ﬁre while asking ATC for vectors to the nearest ﬁeld.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why may a pilot be asked to hold?", "answer": "A pilot may be asked to hold for a variety of reasons, including:\n- Arrival delays\n- Delaying an approach for weather", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why may pilots choose to hold?", "answer": "- To troubleshoot an issue while remaining in the same general area\n- To wait for weather to improve", "id": "ifr_00000"}

{"question": "What kinds of ﬁxes can holds be created on?", "answer": "Any ﬁx, really.\n- GPS fix\n- Intersection of two radials\n- A VOR station\n- A DME fix along a VOR radial\n- A RNAV distance along an RNAV course", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What deﬁnes a particular hold?", "answer": "A hold is deﬁned by four elements:\n- The inbound course\n- The length of the inbound leg\n- The direction of the turn\n- The holding fix", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How can leg lengths be deﬁned?", "answer": "Leg lengths can be deﬁned by time or distance. The exact way distance is measured will depend on whether the hold is deﬁned by DME distance or RNAV distance.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "A holding clearance states “Grumman 123FA, hold southeast on the SAC 150° radial.” What will be the outbound course?", "answer": "150°", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "A holding clearance states “Piper 333FA, hold north on the ABQ 013° radial, left turns.” What will be the outbound and inbound courses?", "answer": "Inbound course 193°, outbound course 013°", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why do pilots calculate reserve time?", "answer": "So that they know how long they can hold, and can inform ATC of their maximum holding time.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of using conservative calculations for holding time?", "answer": "Should you encounter unexpected delays after the hold (e.g. long approach vectors) you will have extra fuel to compensate.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Can a pilot legally land with less than 45 minutes of reserve fuel?", "answer": "Yes.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What kind of circumstances might warrant landing with more than 45 minutes of reserve fuel?", "answer": "A wide variety of circumstances including:\n- Low visibility at the destination airport (more fuel reserve in the event of a missed approach)\n- When approaching to land at an airport with no nearby alternate\n- Any time the pilot feels it’s best in the interest of safety.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "A pilot calculates that they can hold for 20 minutes in a standard 1-minute hold. How many turns in the hold with that correspond to?", "answer": "5 turns.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How do distance-deﬁned holds differ when the distance is deﬁned using GPS vs. DME?", "answer": "GPS holds calculate the distance of the straight line segment. DME holds use the holding ﬁx DME $^+$  the leg distance, which results in a small slant-range error.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What additional challenges might be encountered when holding over a VOR?", "answer": "When approaching the holding ﬁx (VOR) the airplane will enter the cone of confusion. This can, in particular, make it difﬁcult to intercept or correct on an inbound course close to the holding ﬁx.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Can pilots requests holds other than published holds, or request published holds with modiﬁcations?", "answer": "Yes.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the three recommend types of entries?", "answer": "Direct, Parallel, and Teardrop", "id": "ifr_00000"}

{"question": "A pilot is proceeding direct to the holding ﬁx on a heading of  $\\mathbf{085^{\\circ}}$ . The hold has an inbound course of  $\\mathbf{065^{\\circ}}$ . What entry type should they make?", "answer": "Direct", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How many degrees does a pilot offset while making a teardrop entry?", "answer": "30 degrees", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What minimal information is required to determine the type of hold entry?", "answer": "- Direct course to the holding ﬁx\n- Outbound course\n- Turn direction", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why is it important to quickly and easily determine how to enter a hold?", "answer": "Pilots are often asked to hold in relatively high-workload environments. They are likely to be performing other tasks in addition to holding, so they must be able to calculate a hold entry without disregarding other necessary tasks.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of using the ﬁve T’s?", "answer": "To alleviate the possibility of missing a step in the holding process.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Do we always need to use all ﬁve?", "answer": "No, holding based on GPS distances instead of time does not require several of the 5 T's.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Should a pilot adhere to the Five T’s while crossing ﬁxes in the en-route structure (e.g. on an airway or when crossing GPS ﬁxes along a non-airway route)? Why or why not? There is not particular right answer to this question — just think a bit about it!", "answer": "It’s a great idea, but pilots will need to recognize that not all of the steps will be necessary, and in fact sometimes none of them will be (for example, crossing a ﬁx along a straight-line segment of an airway).", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the general steps of holding?", "answer": "Build a mental model and establish situational awareness, slow to holding speed, enter the hold, communicate with ATC, time the hold and repeat.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What information is required to determine the type of hold entry?", "answer": "Your position relative to the holding ﬁx and the course of the hold.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If a turn direct to the outbound course is left and 55°, for a standard hold, what type of entry should be made?", "answer": "Direct.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If a turn direct to the outbound course is right and 180°, for a non-standard hold, what type of entry should be made?", "answer": "Direct entry.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If a teardrop entry is to be used, and the outbound course is  $\\mathbf{155^{\\circ}}$  in a non-standard hold, what will the initial teardrop heading be?", "answer": "185°", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "You are ﬂying at 255 knots at 13,000 feet prior to entering a holding pattern. Will you need to slow before your hold entry? If so, by how much?", "answer": "Yes, by 25 knots.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "You are required to slow by 80 knots before entering a holding pattern. How many minutes before crossing the holding ﬁx must you start slowing?", "answer": "Early enough that you are able to be at your holding speed within 3 minutes of arriving at the holding ﬁx at that holding speed.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of the “shortest turn to the outbound course” technique?", "answer": "The “shortest turn” rule of them is generally correct, but sometimes not in line with the AIM recommendation when the hold entry is near the boundary between a direct and either teardrop or parallel entry.", "id": "ifr_00000"}

{"question": "ATC instructs you to “hold N of the PVF 355° radial 20 DME, right turns. You are over PVF. What is your recommended hold entry?", "answer": "Direct.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "ATC instructs you to “hold N of the PVF 355° radial 20 DME, right turns. You are over PVF. What is your recommended hold entry?", "answer": "Parallel.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of departure procedures?", "answer": "To provide vertical and lateral guidance without visual reference to the outside up to the enroute structure.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between ODPs and SIDs?", "answer": "ODPs exist primary for obstacle clearance, while SIDs do the same, they primarily surround large terminal airports for trafﬁc ﬂow.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why is it so important to brief the departure procedure?", "answer": "Brieﬁng the departure procedure should provide several key pieces of information for solutions pertaining to engine failures and weather on departure and the associated courses of action.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If ATC clears us direct to a ﬁx while we are on a departure procedure, may we accept that clearance?", "answer": "Yes, provided you are in radar coverage.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "When must pilots make position reports upon crossing a compulsory reporting point?", "answer": "When arriving at the compulsory reporting point.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If, along an airway, the MEA changes from 4,000ʹ to 6,000ʹ, what is the latest time a pilot may initiate the climb?", "answer": "At the last ﬁx unless there is a MCA. Then you must start your climb to be at or above the MCA  by that ﬁx.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If a pilot is flying at 120 knots at 13,000ʹ and the MEA changes to 16,000ʹ at the next fix, what is the latest they may initiate a climb, assuming they only climb at the minimum climb gradient?", "answer": "If there is no MCA restriction then you start your climb at the ﬁx.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "A pilot crosses over a VOR on an airway that is defined by the 050° radial from one direction and the 230° radial in the other direction. If they navigated correctly to the station and crossover without readjusting the OBS, will they experience reverse sensing?", "answer": "No.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Are there times when terrain clearance is assured, but navigation reception is not?", "answer": "Yes, when at or above the MOCA or MEA but bellow the MRA. Or at the MOCA and beyond 22 NM from the VOR.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between a precision and non-precision approach?", "answer": "Precision is ground based, has lower weather minimums and always has a glide slope.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the general steps to an ILS approach?", "answer": "Vectored to intercept the LOC or navigate to a published intersection or IAP on the approach where you can intercept the LOC.

{"question": "When is a missed approach commenced on an ILS approach?", "answer": "When reaching the DA while being on the LOC and glide slope.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "If the runway is not in sight, but part of the airport environment is, how does that change the approach?", "answer": "If the runway environment is in sight you are allowed to descend 100’ below minimums.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are the major differences between precision and non-precision approaches?", "answer": "- Precision approaches are ground based and have a glideslope\n- There is a DA/DH instead of a MDA", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What are some types of non-precision approaches, and how are they different from one another?", "answer": "NDB, VOR, LDA, and LOC.\nGPS is satellite-based and may have an artificial glide path. If it's an LPV approach, it likely has lower minimums. NDB approaches are ground-based and require ADF equipment. VOR approaches are ground-based. LDA approaches are similar to a localizer, but offset.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "When is a missed approach commenced on a non-precision approach?", "answer": "At the MAP. Could be identiﬁed by time, distance or station passage. Or when full-scale deletion/ loss of navigation indication or whenever you think it is safer to do so.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the signiﬁcance of the VDP?", "answer": "It allows you to descend bellow the published minimums. When you can see the airport.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How should a pilot execute a missed approach procedure at the VDP?", "answer": "Pilot should maintain alt and wait till reaching the MAP before executing the actual missed approach procedure.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a missed approach procedure?", "answer": "A safe and published procedure to get you back away from the ground when you have conducted an approach but was unable to see the runway.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "You have planned and briefed to ﬂy the ILS approach. Before commencing the approach, ATC informs you that the glideslope is inoperative, but the localizer approach is available. How will a missed approach procedure change if you ﬂy the localizer vs. an ILS?", "answer": "You will ﬂy to the MAP (Missed approach point) instead of the DA/DH (Decision Alt/Decision height) before executing the missed approach. The MAP will also have higher minimums vs the DH.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a visual approach?", "answer": "It allows the pilot to fly using outside visuals as primary navigation and not fly a published approach. You can use this to not have to fly a full published approach and can be quicker to get to your destination. You should still have a approach course loaded up for situational awareness.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Are airplanes conducting visual approaches still on an IFR ﬂight plan?", "answer": "Yes, they are just conducting a visual approach.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "A pilot reports the ﬁeld in sight, with weather conditions at the ﬁeld reported as overcast at 900 feet and 10 miles visibility. May the pilot ﬂy a visual approach?", "answer": "No, you need a reported 1000’ ceiling and 3 SM visibility.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "On departure while being vectored to ABC VOR, you experience a communications failure in instrument conditions. What should you do?", "answer": "Continue the vectored heading to the expected route.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "While ﬂying in instrument conditions in the mountains, you encounter rime icing. The ground is only 2,500 below you and you are at MEA. What options do you have?", "answer": "Turn on de-ice and anti-ice equipment. Turn around. Declare emergency and descend. You may be able to climb. You would need to climb to a altitude that the temperature is approximately -15C (possibly out of the question). Turn on afterburners and get to destination faster.\nIn other words, in most light non-FIKI airplanes, you don’t have many options. Best to not get there in the first place!", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Conditions have deteriorated considerably in your area, and you are accruing clear ice as a result of freezing rain. The nearest airport is 5 minutes away and reporting 200 foot ceilings and 1 and 1/2 visibility. The ILS requires 200 and 1 3/4. The next closest airport is 15 minutes away and reporting 250 foot ceilings and 2sm visibility, with an ILS approach with minimums of  $\\mathbf{200^{\\prime}}$  and 1 1/4sm visibility. What will you do and why?", "answer": "As PIC you need to determine if doing the nearby approach with less visibility in less ﬂight time is safer then ﬂying longer lower visibility minimums. The risks are: Can you continue to ﬂy for 15 minutes with continually accruing ice? Is the weather still deteriorating? Will the weather be worse or better at the next airport?", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "While ﬂying at 7,000 feet, you experience light rime icing. The MEA is 4,000ʹ on your segment of the airway. What might you consider doing?", "answer": "You may, depending on the weather conditions, be able to descent to the MEA and escape the icing. Or, you may be able to climb out of icing conditions, depending on ceiling heights.\nAs PIC you could declare an emergency if you think a particularly situation is more dangerous than going below minimums to land (e.g. running out of fuel, being on fire, etc).", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why is continuing below minimums dangerous? Why may it very occasionally be the right action?", "answer": "You do not know if you will see the ground before it sees you. Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) kills pilots every year.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How can pilots take preemptive action to avoid low-fuel situations?", "answer": "- Have more than the minimum fuel required. “The only time you have too much fuel when you are on ﬁre.”\n- Be decisive in actions that avoid creating low-fuel situations (e.g. holding too long).", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "Why can attempting to act at the highest level of precision be a less-safe option in certain situations?", "answer": "Sometimes the “good-enough” must be embraced for the sake of taking approximately correct action. For example, over-analyzing a diversion decision while on ﬁre is far more dangerous than efﬁciently picking what seems to be the best option and beginning to execute.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
{"question": "How might fear impede your ability to approach an emergency situation from an ideal vantage point?", "answer": "Fear can effect our ability to process information. Problem solving,  decision - making , situational awareness, and related intellectual activities can be impeded.", "id": "ifr_00000"}
