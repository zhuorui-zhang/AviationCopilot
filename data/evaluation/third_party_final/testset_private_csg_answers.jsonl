{"question": "Does a private pilot need to carry a logbook? What about a student pilot?", "answer": "Private Pilot does not, but a student pilot likely will. When a student pilot ﬂies solo he/she receives written endorsements that give them legal permission to operate under certain conditions. Without these endorsements, the student cannot ﬂy solo and these endorsements are almost always in the logbook.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When does your medical certiﬁcate expire?", "answer": "Make sure you know when your medical will expire. For 3rd class medicals, you will need to renew after the 60th calendar month if you are under 40 years of age, and after the 24th calendar month if you are 40 and older. You can consult our “All About Medicals” handout in the Flight Bag for more information.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You arrive to the airport only to realize that you’ve left your logbook at home. As a private pilot, can you still ﬂy?", "answer": "Absolutely. In fact, it is recommended that you don’t carry your logbook when you ﬂy. Keep it somewhere safe.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You recently lost your wallet, but you have a student ID in your backpack. Can you use that to fulﬁll the photo ID requirement?", "answer": "No, the ID must be government issued.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "Your dog just died a few hours before you were scheduled to go ﬂy with a friend. Are you safe to ﬂy?", "answer": "Maybe, and maybe not. The challenging part about psychological factor is that they vary from person to person. Generally speaking, most new pilots should avoid ﬂying immediately after something like that.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You wake up for a 5am ﬂight, have a quick cup of coffee while you review the weather and head out. Your return by noon, only to ﬁnd a friend waiting at the airport clubhouse.

You should consider eating before you go on another ﬂight.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Is the IMSAFE assessment a legal requirement or just good practice?", "answer": "The IMSAFE assessment is mostly good practice, but certain components like the rules regarding medications with adverse affects and alcohol are regulatory as well.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What does ADM stand for?", "answer": "Aeronautical Decision Making", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are some examples where pilots are often called upon to exercise good ADM?", "answer": "Deciding whether to continue into marginal weather or divert", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Can experienced pilots neglect ADM?", "answer": "They can, but should not. If anything, as pilots gain experience ADM should become a more ingrained model as they use it more and more.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You’re ﬂying to a wedding, and are running late. Headwinds were slightly higher than expected, but you’re fairly conﬁdent you’ll have enough fuel. What will you do?", "answer": "We don’t ﬂy “fairly conﬁdent” that we’ll have enough fuel. We either do or don’t and in this case it sounds like we don’t. Take the delay, add fuel.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Now you’re in ﬂight and surprisingly receiving good tailwinds. But your right fuel gauge is decreasing alarmingly fast. What do you do?", "answer": "Something is not right. Check outside to see if you can see any fuel leaking. If you are in a high wing airplane, the fuel cap may be off and you may not realize it. Safer to make a quick stop and check.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Can someone be a good pilot and still exercise poor ADM?", "answer": "That depends entirely on what we think of when we say a “good pilot”.

{"question": "When could a general aviation pilot use CRM?", "answer": "Any time you ﬂy with another pilot is an opportunity to use CRM.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You’re ﬂying with a friend who is also a pilot. He wants to ﬂy into an area of marginal weather and neither of you have an instrument rating. He assures you that his GPS has an amazing terrain feature and it’s so simple that anybody could ﬁgure it out. How do you approach this situation?", "answer": "Try to explain to your friend the risks involved in doing that. Accidents involving spatial disorientation don’t usually result from pilots getting lost in the clouds. They get disoriented as to their pitch and bank, not being used to relying entirely on the instruments for spatial awareness. They then either exceed airframe limitations, causing an in-ﬂight break up or hit the ground.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What resources do you speciﬁcally have to use?", "answer": "Here are just a few of the resources you may have available:\n• ATC\n• Navigation Radios\n• GPS\n• Other Pilots\n• Passengers (have them grab something you need, hold a chart, etc)\n• Autopilot\n• iPad/Cell Phone (i.e. in a lost communications emergency you can call ATC on your phone)", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the problem with relying on  GPS during all of your ﬂights?", "answer": "Over-reliance on GPS can make you complacent at remembering how to navigate other ways, such as using navigation stations or, more importantly for VFR pilots, looking outside.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why should pilots know how to use all systems available to them?", "answer": "Pilots can reduce their workload and increase their ability to accomplish tasks when they know how to use their resources wisely.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You’re ﬂying into a very busy airspace environment and you know that you are task saturated between navigating and coordinating with ATC. You have autopilot available, but you know that pilots who use autopilot often become reliant upon it, so you elect to leave it off.

{"question": "What is the difference between a temperature gauge and an oil temperature gauge?", "answer": "A temperature gauge is required for liquid cooled engines, and an oil temperature gauge is required for air cooled engines. Both gauges are intended to tell you whether your engine is being cooled properly. An overheated engine can seize and stop running. Most training airplanes have air cooled engines and therefore require the oil temperature gauge.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You rent a 1960s Cessna 170, which you notice does not have a working anti-collision light. You inquire to the ﬂight school about this, and they say that it’s not legally required. Are they correct?", "answer": "Yes, they are correct. Anti-collision lights are only required during daylight operations for airplanes certiﬁed after June 1996.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are out for a late afternoon ﬂight, and expect to land just before sundown. You don’t have any of the required night VFR equipment on board. As you return to the airport, you are told that the only runway is closed because an airplane landed gear up. You have 5 minutes until sunset, 30 minutes of fuel and there are several other airports within a 10 minutes ﬂight. What do you do?", "answer": "You should immediately divert to one of the other nearby airports and land. It will put you slightly past sunset, which is technically illegal, but it is far safer that continuing to wait for the ﬁrst airport’s runway to reopen as you burn into the last remaining fuel and while it gets dark.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You have invited a friend to go for a short night ﬂight. It is a cloudless night with a full moon. When you preﬂight the airplane you ﬁnd that the landing light is inoperative. Is it required for your ﬂight?", "answer": "No, it is not required, because the night is not for hire.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What four steps are required to determine if one can legally ﬂy with inoperative equipment?", "answer": "1. Is it required by 91.205? (TOMATOFLAMES, FLAPS)\n2. Is it required by A\n2. Is it required by AD?\n3. Is it required by the TCD\n3. Is it required by the TCDS?\n4. Is it required by the KOEL?", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why would we want to disable/remove inoperative equipment?", "answer": "1. Inoperative equipment could pose a ﬁre risk, depending on the nature of the failure. Flying around with a powered system with a broken wire, for example, is not desirable.\n2. If an airplane is flown by multiple pilots, it is possible the other pilots will fly the\nairplane not realize equipment is broken and either anticipate using it only to realize it\nis broken or use it not realizing it is broken, possibly creating a safety issue.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the TCDS?", "answer": "Type Certiﬁcate Data Sheet - This is paperwork that was furnished when the airplane was certiﬁed and often contains information about required equipment.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are ADs?", "answer": "Airworthiness Directives - These are changes that must be complied with in order to maintain an aircraft’s airworthiness status. They come in two forms: One-time and Recurring ADs. ADs are issued when a manufacturing defect or design error is discovered.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are the proud owner of a small airplane. You ﬁnd out that the manufacturer has issued an AD to reinforce the tail structure. Compliance is required effective immediately. How long do you have until you cannot ﬂy before complying with the AD?", "answer": "Compliance is effective immediately, so you cannot ﬂy until the AD is complied with.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You discover upon preﬂight that your airplane has an inoperative taxi light. It is daylight, and you’ll only be out for about 30 minutes, so you decide to take the airplane and have the local mechanic ﬁx it after you land. Is this legal? More importantly, is there any safety issue associated with this? How does the safety situation change if this is a club airplane that will be ﬂown by other pilots later in the day?", "answer": "No, it isn’t legal. The safety issue is that the broken equipment has not been deactivated. This isn’t a huge risk if you don’t use it, knowing that it is broken, but the next pilot may not realize it is broken.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What equipment is listed on the MEL? Is it broken equipment or working equipment?", "answer": "MELs list equipment that can be broken, and provide details as to how to properly deactivate and placard the broken equipment so that the airplane may still be ﬂown.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What does MEL stand for?", "answer": "Minimum Equipment List", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Your ﬂight club airplane has an MEL. You preﬂight the airplane and ﬁnd that the parking brake is inoperative. You look in the MEL and discover that there is no MEL for the parking brake. The ﬂight club says that because it is not required equipment per 91.205 that you can legally ﬂy it. Are they correct?", "answer": "No. MELs must comply with 91.205, but once an MEL is being used, it must be complied with. If the MEL doesn’t include the parking brake, there is no way to legally operate the airplane.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If speed doubles, what happens to drag?", "answer": "Answering this question depends on your airspeed at the beginning: Parasite drag will increase by $\\mathbf{4x}$ , and induced drag will decrease by 4x. But, the total drag this results in is dependent upon what your speed was initially. If you were very slow, doubling your speed could result in less overall drag. If you were already moderately fast, then it will certainly increase your overall drag.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is un-accelerated ﬂight?", "answer": "Flight when lift is equal to weight and thrust is equal to drag.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are ﬂying at 70 knots, with a parasite drag force of 400lbs. How does parasite drag force change when you increase your speed to 140 knots?", "answer": "Parasite drag will increase by the square, so it will increase by 4x.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "To establish an unaccelerated climb, what is required?", "answer": "Excess thrust.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A 60 degree level turn results in a 2G loadfactor, meaning your airplane is effectively twice as heavy as it would be in unaccelerated ﬂight. How much does lift increase?", "answer": "In order to maintain level ﬂight, lift will have to double as well.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of an airfoil?", "answer": "An airfoil is a surface that generates lift as a ﬂuid ﬂows across it.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does an airfoil produce lift?", "answer": "An airfoil produces lift by causing air to accelerate differently over each side of the surface, creating a pressure differential.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What other components of the airplane are airfoils besides the wings?", "answer": "Propeller", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the boundary layer?", "answer": "The boundary layer is a thin layer of air along the surface of an airfoil that is mostly static.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What happens to pressure as the speed of a ﬂuid increases?", "answer": "Pressure decreases as the speed of a ﬂuid increases.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What happens to the temperature of a ﬂuid as speed increases?", "answer": "Temperature of a ﬂuid decreases with speed.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You notice at an airshow that as a jet pulls tightly in a turn, vapor forms over the wings. Why is this?", "answer": "As the jet pulls tightly it is increasing loadfactor and increasing lift. This increased lift causes air to ﬂow faster over the wings, creating a low pressure and a lower temperature. The vapor forms when the temperature of the air reaches the point where it condenses.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In what way does an airfoil act like a Venturi?", "answer": "A Venturi causes a ﬂuid to accelerate by constricting the area in which it ﬂows. An airfoil moving through the air constricts the direct that air may ﬂow, causing it to accelerate.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Your airplane can takeoff at 50 knots. You are taxiing at 10 knots into the wind when you experience a 45 knot gust. Could your airplane accidentally become airborne?", "answer": "Absolutely. Wheel speed has nothing to do with lift.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You put your Cessna 152 on the world’s largest conveyor belt which moves backward at 50 knots. You apply full power. Will the airplane, which requires 50 knots in order to takeoff, be able to takeoff?", "answer": "Yes. It will take us a while to accelerate to the required speed (and we’ll be traveling backwards initially), since we are effectively taking off with a 50 knot tailwind, but the airplane will still accelerate.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is AOA?", "answer": "The angle of attack is the angle between the chordline of the wing and the relative wind.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does lift change as AOA increases?", "answer": "Lift increases as AOA increases, assuming conﬁguration and airspeed are equal.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is a stall?", "answer": "A stall is a loss of airﬂow over an airfoil as it reaches the critical AOA.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is critical AOA and why is it important?", "answer": "The critical AOA is the AOA that causes a stall. It is ﬁxed for a given airfoil, meaning the airfoil will always stall when that particular AOA is reached.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A propeller is an airfoil. How do we change the propeller AOA?", "answer": "We change the propeller AOA the same way we change the wing AOA: The changing our ﬂight path using the elevators. When our wing has a greater AOA our propeller does as well.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In a level turn your airplane is closer to critical AOA that it is in straight and level ﬂight, assuming the same airspeed. Why is this?", "answer": "In a level turn, load factor increases. In other words, the airplane is heavier than it is in level ﬂight and extra lift is required to maintain level ﬂight. This extra lift usually comes in the form of an increased AOA.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How could an airplane be stalled at a high speed, in a nose down attitude?", "answer": "If enough elevator deﬂection was used, the wings would still stall despite the nose down attitude and high speed. However, this would also cause a lot of undue airframe stress, and possibly exceed airframe limits.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Do all airfoils have an angle of attack or just the wings?", "answer": "All airfoils have an AOA.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Some airplanes have horizontal stabilizers in front of the wings (normally called a canard). Often these designs have are designed so that the canard reaches critical AOA before the wings. What is an advantage of such a design?", "answer": "Canard designs often intend to have the canards stall before the wing, which results in a nose-down movement, reducing the wing AOA and preventing a stall.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You transition from a 80 knot climb to a 115 knot cruise. How has the AOA change as you level off?", "answer": "The AOA decreases during level off.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "During a turn from downwind to ﬁnal, and airplane maintains the same descent rate, airspeed and airplane conﬁguration. What happens to AOA through the turn?", "answer": "AOA increases through the turn and decreases again upon rollout. This is why many low altitude stall/spin accidents occur during low speed turns in the trafﬁc pattern.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If you increase your speed at L/D Max, what happens to your drag?", "answer": "Drag will increase.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "Is the drag created by landing gear sticking out into the air ﬂow considered parasite drag or induced drag?", "answer": "Parasite drag.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What determines an airplane’s best glide airspeed?", "answer": "Vg is determined by ﬁnding the airspeed that has the lowest combined parasite and induced drag proﬁle.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Down low near the ground, wingtip vortices are often broken up by the ground before they can fully induce drag on the wings. What effect might this have for airplanes landing or taking off?", "answer": "Induced drag is reduced near the ground (usually at a height of 1/2 the wingspan), causing an airplane with excess speed to ﬂoat down the runway on landing. One takeoff, it can cause airplanes to become airborne but unable to climb higher until they accelerate. This is known as ground effect.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Slow ﬂight is a maneuver in which the pilot ﬂies the airplane with ﬂaps (and gear if, retractable) in the down position and sustains level ﬂight at a slow airspeed. Often, slow ﬂight requires a large amount of power to maintain level ﬂight and sufﬁcient airspeed. Why is this?", "answer": "High power may be required during slow ﬂight because the airplane has a lot of induced drag as a result of the low airspeed.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What 3 ways can a pilot change lift?", "answer": "Increase speed, increase AOA, change airplane conﬁguration.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does a pilot change the AOA?", "answer": "By using the elevator/stabilator in conjunction with power.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What wing shape generally generates more lift for a given airspeed/AOA? What generates less?", "answer": "A thick cambered wing will generate more lift for a given airspeed and AOA than a thin, symmetrical wing.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why does a higher airspeed create more lift?", "answer": "A higher airspeed increases the airﬂow across the wings. If any lift is being generated, more will be created as airspeed increases.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What ﬂight control most directly is used to change the AOA?", "answer": "The elevator.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "There is a limit to how much lift can be increased by changing the AOA. What is this limit called?", "answer": "Critical AOA.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If an airplane with a symmetrical airfoil has a 0° AOA, what will be its flight path? Will this change with an increase in airspeed?", "answer": "The airplane will descend because a symmetrical airfoil at 0° AOA does not produce lift. An increase in airspeed will not cause lift to be generated. A positive AOA must be established.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Are elevator position and AOA directly linked? Are elevator force and AOA directly linked?", "answer": "Elevator position and AOA and directly linked, but elevator pressure and AOA are not. Maintaining a given AOA will require different levels of force depending on airspeed.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Which ﬂight controls help us pitch? To roll? To yaw?", "answer": "• Pitch: Elevator\n• Roll: Aileron\n• Yaw: Rudder", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If an airplane rolls left, what do the ailerons do?", "answer": "The left aileron comes up and the right aileron goes down.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How do the elevators move to pitch down?", "answer": "The trailing edge of the elevator moves down.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What moves the ﬂight controls? How does movement of the ﬂight controls happen from the pilot moving the stick/yoke?", "answer": "In light training airplanes, ﬂight controls are usually connected to the yoke/stick through cables and pulleys.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A fellow pilot tells you that an airplane cannot be turned without an elevator or equivalent pitch ﬂight control. In what way are they correct?", "answer": "In order to turn an airplane, it must be rolled and then loaded. Roll and pull. If an airplane is simply rolled and not pulled it will lose vertical lift, gradually descent but won’t change heading in any effective manner.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Theoretically speaking, if a ﬂight control was moved too far or too abruptly, could it cause the ﬂight surface to stall? Why do you think this is generally not a concern in light training airplanes?", "answer": "Yes, it could. Usually this is not a major concern in light training airplanes because such adverse tendencies have mostly been avoiding through the design process.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is adverse yaw?", "answer": "Adverse yaw is the yawing force generated from unequal lift and drag produced from using ailerons. It causes a rolled airplane to yaw towards the outside (opposite direction) of a turn.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Once we are established in the turn, do we still experience adverse yaw?", "answer": "No, once the ailerons are neutral as they are in an established turn, we will no longer experience adverse yaw.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does the amount of aileron deﬂection change the magnitude of adverse yaw?", "answer": "An increased aileron deﬂection produces an increased adverse yaw effect.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does airspeed change the magnitude of adverse yaw?", "answer": "A decreased airspeed requires more aileron deﬂection to roll, thus increasing the adverse yaw effect. Adverse yaw is often unnoticeable in cruise, but very apparent at slower speeds.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "At very slow airspeeds, some airplanes are able to slowly turn right by deﬂecting the ailerons in a slight left turn, and vice versa. Why is this?", "answer": "This maneuver is accomplished by deﬂecting the ailerons just enough to create an adverse yaw effect, but never long enough to roll the airplane much. So the wings remain mostly level, but the airplane slowly yaws to the outside of the “turn” as a result of adverse yaw.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is P-factor?", "answer": "P-factor is the unequal thrust generated by a propeller when the airplane is not aligned with it’s ﬂight path and is most noticeable during operations with relatively high AOA. The angle between the descending and ascending blades and the oncoming wind produce more thrust on the descending blade (on the right side of the airplane, from the pilot’s perspective). This causes the airplane to yaw left.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is slipstream?", "answer": "Spiraling slipstream is airﬂow that is pushed back by the propeller, which then spirals around the fuselage and strikes the vertical stabilizer and rudder, pushing the empennage (tail section) right and therefore yawing the nose left.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is torque?", "answer": "Torque is the left turning tendency that is the equal-and-opposite reaction of the propeller and crankshaft rotating right.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What factors (airspeed, power, etc) affect each turning tendency?", "answer": "P-factor increases with power and AOA", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What ﬂight regimes have the highest left turning tendencies?", "answer": "Takeoff roll, rotation, initial climb out and go around.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does a pilot counteract left turning tendencies?", "answer": "By adding right rudder.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Which is likely to require more rudder input, a turn to the left or a turn to the right? Assume starting from a neutral rudder position and all other variables being equal.", "answer": "A turn to the right, because left turning tendencies help coordinate turns to the left.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What ﬂight condition is likely to have the least amount of left turning tendency?", "answer": "Low power descent.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A pilot is practicing slow ﬂight, ﬂying just above stall speed (just below stall AOA). Lacking sufﬁcient rudder correction, the airplane begins a gradual left turn. The pilot corrects by adding right aileron and gently pulling back. The airplane promptly ﬂips over to the left and nose dives. Why?", "answer": "The pilot was not using sufﬁcient rudder pressure to counteract left turning tendencies, which resulting in the gradual left turn. The correct response should have been to add right rudder. Instead, they applied right aileron, and adverse yaw increased the left yawing force. When they pulled back they stalled the wings and the airplane entered the ﬁrst stage of a spin.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is a semi-monocoque design? What about monocoque?", "answer": "A monocoque design is a design where the skin of the structure supports the load. A semi- monocoque design is similar, but includes extra reinforcing structures to held avoid structure failure during high loads.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage to using a frame and thin metal to build an airplane, instead of solid metal?", "answer": "Weight reduction.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why is weight such a critical design factor in airplanes?", "answer": "Airplanes cannot ﬂy unless they can produce at least as much lift as they have weight (and in reality, need to be able to produce signiﬁcantly more). Each additional pound of weight is a pound of lift that must be generated to sustain ﬂight.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are preﬂighting your airplane when you notice a wrinkle in the skin. Your friend, who is the owner, says not to worry about it because it doesn’t change aerodynamics very much. Is there still a reason you might be concerned?", "answer": "It may not change the aerodynamics, but a wrinkle in the skin could indicate a failure of an underlying structure. You should have the airplane checked out by a mechanic before ﬂying.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the primary ﬂight controls?", "answer": "Elevators, Ailerons, Rudder.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the secondary ﬂight controls?", "answer": "Flaps and Trim", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In your airplane, how are the primary ﬂight controls actuated? Cables? Hydraulics?", "answer": "This will obviously vary, but the vast majority of light training airplanes use a cable and pulley system.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In your airplane, how are the ﬂaps actuated?", "answer": "This will vary from airplane to airplane. Some systems are purely mechanical, using a large handle on the ﬂoor between the front seats, while other systems use an electric motor and smaller ﬂap switch to control moving the ﬂaps.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In your airplane, how is trim actuated?", "answer": "Some airplanes have an electric trim, but almost all light training airplanes have a manual trim crank or trim wheel that uses a cable pulley system to trim the airplane.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Just before takeoff, you perform a ﬂight control check. As you move the yoke to the left, the left aileron goes down and the right aileron goes up. Is this correct?", "answer": "No! Your ﬂight controls are reversed, which is obviously dangerous. Mechanics will need to remount the ailerons correctly.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "While performing a ﬂight control check you notice that there is a lot of resistance and a kind of jerky motion as you check the elevator. Is this normal?", "answer": "No. Flight controls deﬁnitely shouldn’t bind or have excessive resistance during control checks. Something could be interfering with the cable movement. Don’t ﬂy until a mechanic thoroughly inspects.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "On your downwind to base turn you add the ﬁrst ﬂap selection and feel the airplane quickly steepen the turn. What may have happened?", "answer": "Flaps have likely descended asymmetrically. In this case the up wing ﬂaps came down more than the down wing ﬂaps.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What provides electrical power to the spark plugs?", "answer": "Magnetos", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What functions can exhaust heat serve?", "answer": "Exhaust air is often passed through a shroud which heats clean, cool air to be used for cabin heat, windshield heat and carburetor heat.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How many magnetos are present in a 6 cylinder engine?", "answer": "Usually 2.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How many spark plugs are present in a 6 cylinder engine? 4 cylinder engine?", "answer": "Usually 2 spark plugs per cylinder, so 12 spark plugs with 6 cylinders and 8 spark plugs with 4 cylinders.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You go ﬂying with a long-time friend who is a car mechanic. Halfway through the ﬂight, your alternator quits. Your friend is worried, thinking that the spark plugs will soon lose power and the engine will quit. What do you tell your friend?", "answer": "Tell him that the spark plus are powered by magnetos, unlike in most cars, and that the loss of the alternator has no bearing whatsoever on the continued operation of the engine.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In your airplane, fresh air passes through an exhaust shroud to provide cabin heating. One day, you turn on the cabin heat as you climb into cooler air, and immediately smell exhaust. What may be happening? What is the major risk? What will you do to mitigate that risk?", "answer": "We likely have a leak in the exhaust shroud, causing exhaust air to mix with clean air. The major risk here is carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause victims to experience decreasing performance and lose consciousness. We should immediately turn off the cabin heat and open vents to clear the exhaust smell. Tell a mechanic after landing.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the major disadvantage to a carbureted system?", "answer": "Carbureted systems are susceptible to carburetor ice, which can decrease engine performance of even cause an engine failure in extreme situations.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What brings fuel from the ﬂoat chamber to the venturi?", "answer": "The low pressure in the Venturi creates a suction force.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What distributes fuel-air mixture to each cylinder after if passes through the venturi?", "answer": "The intake manifold.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Mechanically speaking, how does the mixture control operate?", "answer": "The mixture control causes a valve to open and close in the bottom of the ﬂoat bowl. When the valve is fully closed, fuel cannot ﬂow into the venturi.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What happens to air temperature inside the venturi? Why?", "answer": "Air temperature drops, because pressure drops as the ﬂuid velocity increases.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are ﬂying on a humid day and notice the engine starting to run rough and see a drop in RPM. Suspecting carburetor icing, you turn carburetor heat on. You notice a drop in RPM. Is this normal?", "answer": "Yes. Initial use of carburetor heat will cause a drop in RPM as warmer, less-dense air is introduced. However, this should be followed by a gradual rise in RPM as the ice is melted.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When you suspect an engine problem is related to carburetor ice it is imperative that you turn on the carburetor heat as quickly as possible. Why?", "answer": "Usually carburetor heat is provided by passing cool air through the exhaust shroud. Should the engine fail entirely, the exhaust shroud will lose heat and eventually be unable to provide the heat needed to provide carburetor heat. In this situation, it is very unlikely you’ll be able to restart the engine.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the role of the spider valve?", "answer": "To meter fuel.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of a fuel injected system?", "answer": "Advantages: Fuel injected system are not susceptible to carburetor ice, which is the major advantage. They can also allow for more accurate fuel metering, which can decrease fuel burn and provide for more efﬁcient engine operation.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A pilot goes out to their fuel-injected airplane for a return trip back home after a quick lunch at the airport restaurant. It is a hot summer day. They crank the engine, but cannot get it to start. What is likely the problem? What is the solution?", "answer": "The airplane is likely vapor locked. In order to ﬁx the situation, the pilot should ﬂood the engine just a little bit to push fuel through the lines. Then he/she should start the engine using the corresponding ﬂooded start procedure.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does your airplane have a ﬁxed-pitch or a constant speed propeller?", "answer": "Find out! Most light trainers are ﬁxed pitch, but there are plenty of constant speed trainers as well.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What instrument do we use to measure power in an airplane with a ﬁxed-pitch propeller?", "answer": "The tachometer.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of a ﬁxed-pitch propeller?", "answer": "Fixed pitch propellers are cheaper, simple and have low maintenance costs as a result.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Fixed pitch propellers are set at a speciﬁc pitch to yield a corresponding performance proﬁle. If you wanted a propeller pitched for maximum takeoff performance, would that be a propeller with a low or high pitch?", "answer": "A propeller pitched for maximum takeoff performance would be pitched for low pitch, high RPM.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If you began a dive, would this create a temporary overspeed or underspeed condition on the propeller?", "answer": "This could create a temporary overspeed condition. The system would adjust accordingly to allow more oil to ﬂow into the hub and increase blade angle.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of a constant speed propeller?", "answer": "Constant speed propellers can be adjusted to favor performance or efﬁciency depending on requirements. During takeoff a low pitch, high RPM setting can be used, but in cruise a higher pitch, lower RPM setting can be used for better cruise speed and efﬁciency.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In the event of a loss of oil pressure in a single-engine airplane, it is desirable that the propeller moves to a low pitch, high RPM position. Why is this?", "answer": "In a single engine airplane we want the propeller to windmill (keep turning) so that we can try to restart it. A low pitch, high RPM setting is most conducive to windmilling.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why is it desirable that, in a multi-engine airplane, a loss of oil pressure causes the propeller to move to high pitch, low RPM position? How might the design of the system be changed to reﬂect this?", "answer": "In a multi-engine airplane (2 engine in this scenario), we want to reduce drag as much as possible on a failed engine so that we can get the most performance from our airplane with the single engine we have left. A high pitch blade angle creates less drag. Most multi-engine airplanes have a system in place to then allow the pilot to move the blades fully sideways to the oncoming wind (called “feathered”) to reduce the drag even further.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does your airplane have ﬁxed or retractable gear?", "answer": "Most, but not all, initial trainers are ﬁxed.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between a convention and tricycle conﬁguration?", "answer": "A tricycle conﬁguration has a nose wheel and two main wheels under the wings. A conventional system has two main wheels and a tailwheel.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does your airplane have bungees, springs, oleo struts or a combination of those?", "answer": "Check out your airplane or look in the Operation/Limitations Handbook or Airplane Flight Manual.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are interested in buying an airplane to ﬂy in the back-country, which you are going to base at a dirt strip near your house. You talk to a friend involved in sales and he recommends you look for a tailwheel airplane. Why does he make that recommendation?", "answer": "Tailwheel airplanes are often more suited to landing off airport because they have improved propeller clearance and no nose wheel which can get caught in potholes.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage of an oleo strut compared to a spring or bungee system?", "answer": "Oleo struts are often capable of absorbing more force.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You go out to pre-ﬂight the airplane and ﬁnd dark red/black ﬂuid pooled around the nose gear. What does this probably mean?", "answer": "You have a hydraulic ﬂuid leak in the strut. Usually when this happens, it’s caused by a broken seal in the strut.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does your airplane have oleo struts? If so, which wheel assemblies use oleo struts?", "answer": "Know your airplane!", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You preﬂight a Piper Archer and ﬁnd that the right oleo strut sits several inches higher than the left. You rock the wings a bit and the struts mostly even out. What might cause this issue?", "answer": "Often older airplanes just have oleo struts that get a little sticky. They still do their job well, and are safe, but can stick a bit. If an oleo strut is clearly deﬂated, however, that’s a different story and you should check with a mechanic to make sure you don’t do damage.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You ﬂy formation with a friend in your Piper Warrior which has three oleo struts. Your friend takes photos of your airplane in ﬂight. You later look at the photos and see that your oleo struts are much lower in the photos than they normally are when you preﬂight. Why is this?", "answer": "Oleo struts work by exerting a constant base line of pressure on the system. When the airplane takes off, the strut expands because there is no weight compressing the strut. In fact, if it weren’t for the joint holding the bottom of the strut on, it would simply slide off.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages to a retractable gear system?", "answer": "Retractable gear decreases drag, which reduces fuel burn rate and increases cruise speed and performance.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the disadvantages of a retractable gear system?", "answer": "Retractable gear systems are often expensive, require far more maintenance (and therefore maintenance cost) and are more subject to malfunctions than ﬁxed gear systems.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are some ways that retractable gear can be actuated?", "answer": "Hydraulic-Electric: Electric pump powers hydraulic systems which raise the gear", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In a retractable gear system, what typically holds the gear down?", "answer": "Springs and over center locks.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What mechanisms can hold the gear up in a retractable system?", "answer": "Usually mechanical up locks. However, some systems to require constant hydraulic pressure to hold the gear up.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Would hydraulic pressure ever be used to hold the gear down? Why would this be a bad idea?", "answer": "A system requiring hydraulic pressure to keep the gear down would require a gear up landing in the event of hydraulic pressure loss. Most systems either fail into the down position or don’t fail into either position or the other.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does your airplane have a retractable gear system? If so, how is it actuated?", "answer": "You’re at the club house talking to friends about gear failures. Your friend asserts that if they experienced a landing gear failure that they would make a normal approach and then kill the engine right before touchdown to avoid denting the propeller on landing. Do you think there is merit in doing so?", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You’re at the club house talking to friends about gear failures. Your friend asserts that if they experienced a landing gear failure that they would make a normal approach and then kill the engine right before touchdown to avoid denting the propeller on landing. Do you think there is merit in doing so?", "answer": "This is a very common discussion in general aviation circles. The bottom line, however, is that pilots do not die from intelligent gear up landings. Plenty have died, however, trying to secure their engine on ﬁnal, only to realize that they weren’t in gliding distance from the runway. You are better off destroying the prop and landing safely than risking your life, and your passengers lives, for a hunk of metal.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Another friend says that if they had a gear failure that they would land in the grass alongside the runway instead of landing on the pavement, in an effort to avoid damaging the airplane more than necessary. Why is this a bad idea?", "answer": "This is another common gear-up discussion. Generally speaking pavement is great for gear up landings because it does not cause rapid deceleration. Grass can get bunched together and cause you to ﬂip over. This is one scenario where you’re more likely to keep yourself and your airplane in better shape if you just land it on concrete.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How would you recognize a fuel leak during preﬂight?", "answer": "A fuel leak is often visible by blue staining along the area around the fuel tank or fuel lines. Often a fuel leak can be smelled as well.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Your airplane is certiﬁed for 100LL. You land at an airport and reﬁll it with 80/87 octane. Will the airplane run safely on 80/87?", "answer": "No. Doing so could be potentially harmful to your engine.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What function does oil serve?", "answer": "Oil cools the engine, removes contaminants and lubricates moving parts.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages of a wet sump system?", "answer": "Wet sump systems are simple and cheap.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What main factor dictates the type of oil used in your airplane?", "answer": "Other than the type of engine, the temperature of the air in normal operating conditions is the major consideration. Oil is more viscous in cold temperatures, so in a colder environment, a thinner oil may be desired.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does oil circulate through the engine?", "answer": "Oil is pumped from the bottom of the oil pan through the oil system and then ﬂows back to the oil pan.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In cruise, you notice your oil pressure gauge indicating zero. Oil temperature remains at normal levels. What does this likely indicate?", "answer": "Likely this is a gauge malfunction. Low oil pressure situations are usually accompanied by a rise in oil temperature.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In cruise, you notice your oil pressure gauge decreasing rapidly. Oil temperature, meanwhile, is increasing rapidly. What is this likely indicating?", "answer": "This is indicating a loss of oil pressure, probably due to an oil leak. It is likely the engine will fail shortly and you should quickly ﬁnd a suitable airport to land at, or if not possible, a safe off-airport landing location.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why might a mechanic recommend that you change oil types between summer and winter?", "answer": "To use an oil more suitable to different temperature ranges.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You depart a mountain airstrip and climb at your best-angle climb speed, which is relatively slow, to avoid terrain. You notice that your oil temperature is getting rather high. Why is this, and how could you improve the situation while still avoiding terrain?", "answer": "Oil is usually cooled by airﬂow through the front of the engine cowl. Steep climbs limit airﬂow across the oil cooler, which can lead to warm oil temperatures. Shallow your climb. If shallowing your climb will cause issues with terrain clearance, consider circling in place in a shallower climb until you’ve climbed over the terrain.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are your airplane’s hydraulic systems?", "answer": "The incompressible characteristic of ﬂuids allows us to use hydraulics to:", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Aeration is the condition where air/gas enters a ﬂuid line. Why might this be a major issue in a hydraulic system like brakes?", "answer": "Fluid is generally not very compressible, but air is. Air introduced in a hydraulic line will compress, potentially causing the hydraulic system to fail.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage mechanical actuation as opposed to hydraulic actuation in a system like ﬂight controls? What is the disadvantage?", "answer": "Advantage: Mechanical systems do not require electric motors, hydraulic pumps, in order to operate, and are therefore less likely to fail.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "A master switch usually has two sides. What is each one for?", "answer": "One side connects the battery to the electrical system, and the other side connects the alternator to the electrical system.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "The battery discharges while supplying electrical power to systems. What re-charges the battery?", "answer": "The alternator", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If your engine stopped, would the battery discharge?", "answer": "Yes.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If your alternator failed, would the battery discharge?", "answer": "Yes.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is a bus?", "answer": "A bus is a component that provides electricity to multiple components.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Many airplanes have an avionics master switch. What does this switch do?", "answer": "The avionics master switch isolates the navigation and communication radios. It is usually used to quickly turn off all navigation and communication radios before shutting down the airplane, to prevent damage to systems.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What advantage do circuit breakers have over fuses? What extra risk do they create for uneducated/careless pilots?", "answer": "Unlike fuses, which burn, circuit breakers pop and can therefore be reset. However, circuit breakers can create a dangerous situation if pilots force a popped circuit breaker to stay in. This can create an over temperature situation and even potentially lead to an in ﬂight ﬁre.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Before takeoff, many pilots turn on a light or electric pump and while watching the ammeter. What are they testing in doing this?", "answer": "Turning on an electrical component will show a slight draw on the ammeter. Pilots can watch for this slight draw to detect that the ammeter is in fact operating and not just stuck at a certain value.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In an electrical emergency in busy airspace, how could you limit battery discharge while also maintaining communication with ATC?", "answer": "Transmitting requires far more power than receiving. Although you should not continue into busy airspace with an electrical emergency unless absolutely necessary, you can tell ATC that you have a battery that is draining and that you are going to limit transmissions, but will still be listening on frequency. You should also shed all unnecessary electrical equipment, which may include items like:", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What instrument shows airspeed?", "answer": "Airspeed indicator", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What instrument shows the airplane’s altitude?", "answer": "Altimeter", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What instrument shows the airplane’s heading?", "answer": "Heading indicator, aka Directional Gyro", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Does the DG have a compass inside it?", "answer": "No.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Which instruments are gyroscopic?", "answer": "Attitude Indicator, Directional Gyro, Turn Coordinator", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Which instruments are pitot-static?", "answer": "Airspeed Indicator, Altimeter, VSI", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If your static port becomes clogged, how would instruments will be affected?", "answer": "Airspeed Indicator: Erroneous airspeed readings.\nAltimeter: Needle will stop moving\nVSI: Needle will stop moving.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "The directional gyro and compass essentially provide the pilot with the same information. Why have two different instruments instead of one?", "answer": "The magnetic compass is difﬁcult to use because of various compass errors. The directional gyro is a simple gyro that does not contain a compass and is therefore not subject to these errors. In straight and level ﬂight the compass is more accurate, but the directional gyro is easier to use for most operations.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "On an easterly heading, you transition from a climb to level ﬂight. You notice that the compass momentarily indicates a turn to the left. Is this normal? Why or why not?", "answer": "This is normal. On East/West headings, acceleration may initially cause the compass to indicate a turn North. Similarly a deceleration can cause the compass to indicate a turn South.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How will your instruments indicate if the pitot-tube is blocked, but the drain hole and static ports are open?", "answer": "Airspeed will indicate zero, but the Altimeter and VSI will be accurate.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How will your instruments indicate if the pitot-tube and drain hole clog but the static ports are open?", "answer": "Airspeed will be ﬁxed initially, but will indicate an increase with a climb and a decrease with a descent. This is because the air in the pitot side is now ﬁxed, but the static pressure will change with altitude. Altimeter and VSI will continue to operate normally.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How will your instruments indicate if the pitot-tube and drain hole are open but the static ports clog?", "answer": "Airspeed will be unreliable. Altimeter will freeze at the altitude where the blockage occurred. The VSI will indicate zero.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In ﬂight, you notice something wrong with your instruments: The turn coordinator indicates a turn to the left, while the attitude indicator shows a descending turn to the right. The altimeter and VSI indicate level ﬂight, and the airspeed indicator indicates cruise speed. What has likely occurred?", "answer": "All instruments are in agreement except the attitude indicator. Therefore, the attitude indicator has most likely failed. Ignore it, or cover it up (or, if you’re VFR, just keep looking outside, you don’t need it).", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of a standby frequency in a radio?", "answer": "Standby frequencies allow you to tune the next frequency without leaving the current frequency. This is particularly nice if you go to the next frequency only to ﬁnd that there is nobody there. You can easily switch to your last frequency.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Do communication and navigation radios operate on the same frequency band?", "answer": "No. Communication radios operate from 118.000-136.975 MHz and navigation radios operate from 108.000-117.950 MHz", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "After starting the airplane you turn on the avionics and immediately hear a lot of static. What could be the cause?", "answer": "You may need to adjust the volume or squelch or change frequencies.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "While on the ground you attempt to use Com Radio #2 to pick up the weather, while you monitor ground using Com Radio #1. The signal on Radio #2 comes in broken. What could be the reason for this?", "answer": "Sometimes, the com #2 radio antenna is on the underside of airplanes. This can cause a weaker signal that the Com #1 antenna which is usually on the top. When a weak signal makes it hard to pick up a transmission on #2, it can sometimes help to just switch to #1.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the standard trafﬁc pattern direction?", "answer": "Left", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the segmented circle?", "answer": "The segmented circle tells pilots about trafﬁc patterns that are non-standard (i.e. right trafﬁc).", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When would a pilot use a teardrop entry? What about a forty-ﬁve entry?", "answer": "A tear drop entry would be used to enter the downwind if you are on the side of the airport that doesn’t have the trafﬁc pattern. In other words, when you have to cross over the airport in order to reach the side of the airport with the trafﬁc pattern.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You’re at trafﬁc pattern altitude on an 8 mile $45^{\\circ}$ to the downwind. You make your ﬁrst position report. Immediately after, another airplane calls in on a 7 mile $45^{\\circ}$ . Is there an issue here? How will you react?", "answer": "There is an issue. A report of one mile is a pretty small distance. You should assume that you and the other airplane are practically on top of each until you can get visual contact. Call again on CTAF and tell them your altitude, and ask them what their altitude is. If you are separate vertically, there is little cause for alarm over lateral proximity.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "At a towered airport, you call in and are told to make a left base for runway 32. How will you do this?", "answer": "Proceed directly to the point where you would normally turn from downwind to base (instead of entering the downwind ﬁrst) and continue the approach from that point.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are in cruise when you notice the local weather deteriorating rapidly. You decide to divert to a small non towered airport, which has left trafﬁc for both runways. As you near the airport, you see that there are clouds at trafﬁc pattern altitude along the 45 to the favorable runway. How do you proceed?", "answer": "Although a normal entry would be left trafﬁc, that is not the safest option at the moment. Your priorities are getting on the ground before the weather gets worse, and landing safely. Enter right trafﬁc for the favorable runway (or a base entry or straight-in if that makes more sense) and land.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "On short ﬁnal, another airplanes taxis on to the runway to begin their takeoff roll. They are totally unaware of your presence, and without a radio. You initiate a go around. Why is it critical that you also side step away from the downwind leg?", "answer": "When you side-step you are able to maintain visual contact on the conﬂicting trafﬁc. You are going around at the same time they are taking off. Therefore, it’s important to keep track of each other to mitigate a collision risk.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "You listen to a non-non-towered airport’s automated weather and learn that the winds are favoring runway 9. As you proceed over the airport to make a teardown entry, you look down at the windsock at notice it slightly favoring runway 27. What is likely happening, and how will you proceed? What wind conditions might you expect as you continue approaching the airport.", "answer": "Winds are either very gusty or light and variable. Either way, you can expect shifting winds on approach. Be aware of this, and proceed to one of the runways (whichever you think the winds are most predominantly favoring). Remember that a go around is always an option.", "id": "private_00000"}

Your friend asks you if you could ﬂy over his house this afternoon to cheer up his brother. You agree. What is the lowest you can ﬂy? Can you ﬂy lower than the standard MSA because you have your friend’s permission?", "answer": "In theory you can go lower and even land on someone’s property with their permission, but your friend lives in the suburbs: you cannot go any lower than the standard MSA without violating the MSA limits of his neighbors and their property. At the lowest, you are limited to 500 feet above persons or property, but realistically speaking you should consider the suburbs to be a congested area, which required 1,000 foot clearance.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "Is ATC required to provide pilots with ﬂight following?", "answer": "No. It is voluntary on the part of pilots and controllers.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage of using ﬂight following?", "answer": "There are several:\n• ATC can provide traffic advisories, which can decrease your risk of a close encounter with another aircraft.\n• In an emergency, you are already on frequency with someone who knows the details of your flight and can assist you.\n• You can pass through airspace that would otherwise require separate ATC communications. Examples where is is valuable could include passing through TFRs, passing through the top portion of a Class C airspace, Or navigation between closely spaced Class D airspace without worrying out accidentally skimming the side of one.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "You’re on a 5 mile ﬁnal and ATC clears another aircraft to make a 2 mile base and land, ahead of you. You’re not sure if it’ll be enough spacing. What do you do?", "answer": "You can slow in advance (within reason, of course, DO NOT slow so much that you stall) to give the aircraft more time and increase spacing. If spacing if very close or the other aircraft is still on the runway, ATC will tell you to go around, or you will tell them you are going around.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "As you’re in left downwind to land on runway 25, another airplane calls in, for the ﬁrst time, saying they’re on left downwind to land on runway 07. What do you do?", "answer": "Try to get the other airplane in sight to verify they are in fact on the left downwind for Runway 7. If they are, it is usually best practice to tell them you will wait for them to land and then follow. If winds do favor runway 25 and there are no other airplanes landing runway 7, you can depart the pattern and re-enter, or simple ﬂy a closed pattern at trafﬁc pattern altitude.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "Immediately after takeoff, in a Cessna 172, a pilot calls in saying they are on the crosswind leg for the runway you just departed. Is there a potential trafﬁc conﬂict? What do you do?", "answer": "There is a potential conﬂict. If they are truly in the crosswind leg, they are probably slightly in front of you or directly on top of you. Do not climb too quickly, for risk of climbing into them. Look over your shoulder to try to get a visual on them.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "How does cool air circulate?", "answer": "Downwards and (in the northern hemisphere), clockwise.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why does much of the weather in North America come from the west?", "answer": "Because surface winds tend to ﬂow north from $\\bf{30^{\\circ}N}$ latitude. As they ﬂow northwards, they bend to the right from the Coriolis effect. This produces westerlies.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the Coriolis effect?", "answer": "The Coriolis effect is the shift in wind direction that occurs as a result of increased friction near the earth’s surface and earth’s rotation.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Weather on the west coast of the U.S. usually comes from the West, while weather in Hawaii often comes from the East. Why is this?", "answer": "Weather on the west coast receives westerlies from air flowing away from 30°N latitude, while Hawaii receives easterlies from air flowing away from 30°N latitude (but in the opposite direction).

{"question": "As you approach your local airport, you see small puffy clouds. If you were to ﬂy through one, what would you expect?", "answer": "Light to moderate turbulence, as the clouds are formed by air that is rising faster than the air surrounding it.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Your friend remarks to you that to avoid turbulence on warm summer days, you should avoid ﬂying directly under clouds. Is this reasonable advice? Why or why not?", "answer": "Yes, this is reasonable advice.

{"question": "How can water stay liquid below a freezing temperature?", "answer": "If freezing water does not have a condensation nucleus it will not freeze.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are some methods pilots can use to escape from icing conditions?", "answer": "• Climb: If better conditions are expected up higher (if, for example you know the clouds stop, or there is freezing rain at your altitude, which indicates warmer temperatures above you.)\n• Descend: Temperature usually decreases with altitude, so descending may allow you to get into warmer air.\n• Turn: If you have just started to pick up ice, that means there was no ice behind you. If you can, turn around and go back to the area without icing.\n• Fly Towards Coastal Areas: Large bodies of water regulate temperature, and you may be able to find more favorable temperatures closer to the coast.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Can ice still cause a fuel-injected engine to quit? If so, how?", "answer": "Yes; Ice can still cause the front of the air-intake to be closed off, preventing airﬂow to the engine. Many fuel-injected engines have an alternate air source for this reason.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "How are winds that are light and variable coded?", "answer": "9900", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What factors can affect an airplane’s performance?", "answer": "• Temperature\n• Weight\n• CG Location\n• Air Pressure\n• Wind\n• Pilot Skill\n• Terrain\n• Weather", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why should pilots not plan on getting the exact performance that’s stated in the performance chart?", "answer": "Those numbers are from test ﬂights using highly skilled pilots in brand new airplanes. Not everyone is an exceptional pilot, and certainly older airplanes do not perform quite as they do when they are brand new.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What performance charts are common-use in your airplane?", "answer": "Look at your airplane’s performance charts. Usually you’ll see things like:\n• Takeoff and landing distance (ground roll and over an obstacle)\n• Time, fuel, and distance to climb\n• Cruise power settings / endurance profiles", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are departing you local airport which has a 2,400 foot runway. You calculate your takeoff ground roll required to be 2,100 feet. Do we have enough information to know if this is a safe takeoff? If not, what are we missing?", "answer": "No, ﬁrst you need to consider if there are obstacles that you need to clear. Knowing your ground roll alone is not a sufﬁcient performance consideration unless there are no obstacles to clear after takeoff.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Generally speaking low temperatures are good for performance. What is a performance metric for which low temperatures are not desirable?", "answer": "Cruise performance. A lower temperature in cruise results in lower true airspeed and higher fuel burn.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the equation for moment?", "answer": "Moment = Weight x Arm", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In general terms, how does a pilot solve a weight and balance problem?", "answer": "Find the weight and moment for each item that will be loaded (bags, passengers, fuel, etc) and add the weights to the aircraft’s empty weight and the moment to the aircraft’s empty moment. Then, divide total moment by total weight to ﬁnd the CG.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is moment?", "answer": "Moment is a calculation of the effect that a weight will have, as a result of it’s weight and location in the airplane.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is arm?", "answer": "Arm is the distance from a standard datum line that the weight is located.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the common term for total moment divided by total weight?", "answer": "Center of Gravity (CG).", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why does an aft CG increase performance?", "answer": "An aft CG requires less tail down force in ﬂight to keep the airplane level. As a result, the airplane is effectively lighter, and thus capable of better performance than an airplane with a forward CG.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the disadvantages to an aft CG?", "answer": "Aircraft loaded with an aft CG tend to be less stable, harder to control, and are easier to spin in a stall with poor rudder control.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the advantages to a forward CG?", "answer": "An aircraft loaded with a forward CG will tend to be more stable, easier to control and less likely to spin in a stall with poor rudder control.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the disadvantages to a forward CG?", "answer": "Aircraft with forward CGs have poorer performance than aircraft with aft CGs. They can also be nose heavy and therefore harder to rotate or ﬂare.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Do pilots control the amount of tail down force, separately from the weight and balance of the aircraft?", "answer": "Yes and no. Pilots use the elevator to add or reduce the forces acting on the tail, but they are limited by the aircraft requirements. Generally, airplanes must climb, cruise and descend at certain AOAs, and the elevator is used to set that AOA. Thus, the pilot can change the tail down force, but has almost no freedom in the amount of tail down force used in a particular ﬂight regime. So technically yes, but practically, no.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If a pilot needs to gain the most altitude in a given time, which speed should they climb at?", "answer": "Vy", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If a pilot needs to clear obstacles in a given distance, which speed should they climb at?", "answer": "Vx", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Which speed is higher, Vx or Vy?", "answer": "Vy", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "While out ﬂying, you notice that when you start from cruise ﬂight, you can climb much steeper at 55 knots than you can at 65 knots. 65 knots is your published Vx climb speed. Why is this the case?", "answer": "These speeds assume you are already in an unaccelerated climb. In other words, Vx and Vy are only truly the best angle or best rate of climb airspeed when you hold that speed. If you are faster to begin with you can obviously gain more altitude in a short distance by trading the extra airspeed for altitude.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why might some pilots want to climb a little faster than Vy under normal conditions?", "answer": "Climbing at Vy can cause the engine to run hotter than is preferable since it can limited the airﬂow across the engine. Many pilots, and especially aircraft owners, prefer to ﬂy a little faster than Vy.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is interpolation?", "answer": "Interpolation is a system of averaging or estimating the value between two known number. In a very simple example, if you know that the climb speed at 1000lbs is 100 knots and at 2000lbs the climb speed is 120 knots, we could interpolate that at 1,500lbs the climb speed is 110 knots.\nInterpolating is often required while using performance tables, because tables only have a finite number of known values. Sometimes you may even need to interpolate twice (e.g. between weights and then between temperatures).\nGenerally when interpolating it’s a good idea to err on the side of being conservative. For example, if you have a takeoff distance chart with temperatures at 20 degrees and 30 degrees and the actual temperature is:\n• 21 degrees —> Use 25 (average 20 and 30)\n• 26 degrees —> Use 30\nWe know that hotter temperatures reduce performance, so it’s safer to estimate performance with a slightly higher temperature than actual, instead of the other way around. When you get better performance than you estimated, that’s a nice surprise. When you get worse performance than you estimated, that can kill you.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When interpolating with temperature, is it better to round up or round down?", "answer": "Round up.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When dealing with pressure altitudes, is it better to round up or round down?", "answer": "Round up.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When it comes to headwind, is it better to round up or round down? What about with tailwind?", "answer": "With a headwind, round down. With a tailwind, round up.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Must a pilot reference a takeoff and landing distance chart every time they ﬂy? Why not?", "answer": "A pilot must know their performance before they ﬂy. If you ﬂy under the same conditions, at the same airport, in the same airplane with similar weights, then you know how the airplane will perform and hence you do not need to do calculations each time. Of course, there is no harm in doing so, and any time there is doubt as to what performance can be achieved, the proper calculations must be made.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "At a high density altitude airport, you rotate and try to climb and the airplane doesn’t climb, even though your performance calculations said it should. Why is this, and what should you do?", "answer": "You have probably rotated early. Normally aircraft performance is sufﬁcient that this goes unnoticed by the pilot. In this case, however, it provided sufﬁcient lift to takeoff, but not sufﬁcient to leave ground effect. At the same time, the high pitch has added enough drag that the airplane is now barely accelerating. You need to lower the nose ﬁrst, accelerate and then climb.\nThis is a great reason why performance calculations are so important in high density altitude situations. If you have a short runway, you do not have time to debate whether you need to change technique, accelerate longer, etc. You either need to takeoff or you need to abort the takeoff.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "You are approaching an airport with a 8,000 foot density altitude. On approach, although you are ﬂying at the published ﬁnal approach speed of 65 knots, you feel like you are very fast. Why is this? Do you need to make any correction?", "answer": "You feel fast because you are fast in terms of groundspeed. In the higher density altitude, the same approach speed which you are (correctly) ﬂying, is a higher groundspeed. This is the reason that takeoff and landing distance increases with density altitude.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "In simple terms, how does a VOR work?", "answer": "A VOR works by comparing the receiving time of two signals. One signal is directional, scanning in $\\mathbf{360^{\\circ}}$ over a set period of time. The other is omni-directional, so it goes in all directions at the same time. Our receiving equipment uses the difference in reception time of the ﬁrst signal and the second to calculate our bearing from the station.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What navigational information can a VOR provide?", "answer": "VOR alone just provides azimuth information.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What does the TO/FROM arrow on a VOR instrument indicate?", "answer": "TO/FROM indicates whether the omni-bearing selector (OBS) course, if ﬂown, would take you to the station or away from the station.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between a radial and a bearing? Can they ever be the same?", "answer": "A radial is a line extending away from a station. A bearing is the path to the station. If, for example, you are directly east of a station, you are on the 090° radial. If you fly 090° and track outbound, your bearing away from the station is also 090°. If you fly to the station, your bearing is 270°.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What condition will create reverse sensing?", "answer": "Reverse sensing will occur when there is a disagreement between you OBS course and your intended route. In other words, if you are trying to go TO the station but have a FROM indication, you will have reverse sensing. Similarly, if you are trying to go FROM the station, but a receiving a TO indication, you will have reverse sensing.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the primary danger in reverse sensing?", "answer": "The danger in reverse sensing is that a pilot will turn the wrong direction to intercept a course and end up in a location they were not intending to be. Depending on where they are ﬂying, there could be mountains, busy airspace, etc. that create a major hazard.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What are the steps to tuning a VOR?", "answer": "Find the VOR frequency, tune it, listen to the ident and then tune the OBS selector.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why is it important to hear the morse code identiﬁer on a VOR?", "answer": "This conﬁrms that your VOR receiver is receiving the station you intended it to. Sometimes, stations will fail or go down for maintenance, in which case the morse code identiﬁer will not play.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What will happen if a pilot tries to ﬂy a course with the wrong TO/FROM indication?", "answer": "They will experience reverse sensing and, as they turn towards a course, will ﬁnd that the course seemingly moves further away from them.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why might the airplane’s heading required to hold a radial not be equal to the bearing to or from the station?", "answer": "Wind correction. A radial is a magnetic course, not a magnetic heading. In order to ﬂy a radial you may need to correct left or right for wind.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the cone of confusion?", "answer": "The cone of confusion is the area nearly directly over a VOR where course adjustments become very sensitive. Pilots often make their lives harder than necessary in the cone of confusion because they “chase” the needles, when they are in fact on course, but simply experiencing the cone of confusion. As a general rule of thumb, do not make major course corrections directly over a VOR unless you are intentionally changing course.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "If a pilot crosses over a VOR from east to west, do they need to re-tune the omni-bearing selector to continue outbound from the station?", "answer": "No. They are continuing on the same bearing. The TO/FROM indication will simple reverse.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "When is station passage determined to have occurred?", "answer": "Station passage is deﬁned by a full reversal of the TO/FROM indication.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is DME?", "answer": "DME is distance measuring equipment. It is a system that determines an airplane’s straight-line distance from a station by timing the difference between sent and received signals.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does DME work?", "answer": "The aircraft’s DME equipment sends a signal to the station, which sends a response signal. The time between sent and received signals is used to calculate the distance.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Do all VORs have DME? How do we know if a VOR has DME equipment?", "answer": "No, only VOR/DME and VORTAC. VOR/DME and VORTAC have different symbols on sectional charts.", "id": "private_00000"}

{"question": "What is slant-range error?", "answer": "DME measures the straight line distance from the aircraft to the station. Some of this distance is vertical. The most obvious slant range error is seen when an airplane is directly over the station. In this case, the aircraft’s altitude will be indicated in miles on the DME. For example, an aircraft directly over the station at 6,000 feet would indicate roughly 1nm from the station.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is an NDB?", "answer": "Non-directional beacons are a type of NavAid, who’s signal is received by an automatic direction ﬁnder (ADF).", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What equipment in the airplane is used to track to an NDB?", "answer": "Automatic Direction Finder (ADF).", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage of an NDB over a VOR? What are the disadvantages?", "answer": "And NDB is lower frequency than a VOR, (high frequency or HF, as opposed to very high frequency or VHF) and can therefore be used beyond line of sight. The disadvantage to NDB is that they are more subject to interference, especially from weather.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the difference between ﬁxed-card and moveable card ADFs?", "answer": "Fixed card ADFs have no directional gyro component. They simply indicate 0° as the aircraft’s current heading. In order to find the bearing to a station, the pilot must add the magnetic heading to the relative bearing shown on the fixed card ADF. Moveable card ADFs have a directional gyro component, and therefore will point directly to the magnetic bearing to a station.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why might the best route to a station not be to follow the exact heading on the ADF needle?", "answer": "Pilots that ﬂy the exact heading on the ADF needle don’t compensate for wind and will end up ﬂying an arcing path to the station, as the wind continuously blows them off course. Instead, they should notice the ADF needle drifting, and make a heading correction to adjust for wind, sufﬁcient to prevent the needle from drifting.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How does GPS work?", "answer": "Global Positioning System (GPS) works by measuring the time it takes for signals to pass from a satellite to a receiver. The time it takes the signal to travel, multiplied by the speed of light, equals the distance from receiver to satellite. By combining four or more signals together, the receiver can calculate it’s exact position based purely on its distance from the satellites.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "How many GPS satellites are needed to establish a 3 dimensional position?", "answer": "4.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "What is the advantage of GPS compared to VORs or NDBs?", "answer": "GPS is more accurate, and allows aircraft to travel directly to any point on earth. Instead of needing to ﬂy from navaid to navaid, the GPS can simply determine a direct course to an airport or waypoint or even random coordinates.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why do many GPS systems require contact with 5 satellites in order to function properly?", "answer": "The 5th satellite is used to back up the other 4. With a 4 satellite system, one of the satellites could be inaccurate and it would create an inaccurate position. A 5th satellite provides an additional data point which can detect a system failure if there is any disagreement among the satellites.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Fill in the blanks: Calculating true course requires lining up the plotter’s black line along the ________ and then referencing the true course by moving directly __________.", "answer": "True course. Horizontally.", "id": "private_00000"}
{"question": "Why is Top of Climb and Top of Descent calculated before we pick checkpoints in the middle?", "answer": "We want to make sure that checkpoints along the route of ﬂight are evenly spaced. We won’t know where to make the ﬁrst and last checkpoints until we ﬁgure out where the top of climb and top of descent are.", "id": "private_00000"}
