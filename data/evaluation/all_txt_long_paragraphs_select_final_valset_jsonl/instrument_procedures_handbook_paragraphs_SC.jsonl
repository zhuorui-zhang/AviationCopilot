[Figure 5-14] It is not a real-time image like that produced by an enhanced flight vision system (EFVS). Unlike EFVS, SVS requires a terrain and obstacle database, a precise navigation solution, and a display. The terrain image is based on the use of data from a digital elevation model (DEM) that is stored within the SVS. With SVS, the synthetic terrain/vision image is intended to enhance pilot awareness of spatial position relative to important features in all visibility conditions. This is particularly useful during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff, approach, and landing where important features such as terrain, obstacles, runways, and landmarks may be depicted on the SVS display. [Figure 5-15] During approach operations, the obvious advantages of SVS are that the digital terrain image remains on the pilot’s display regardless of how poor the visibility is outside. An SVS image can be displayed on either a head-down display or head-up display (HUD).

The SVGS display may be implemented on a head down Primary Flight Display, and/or a Head-Up Display (HUD). SVGS includes additional symbology, integrity and performance monitors and annunciations that enable low visibility operations. These additional monitors assure an accurate depiction of the external scene. An SVGS differs from an EFVS in that it does not produce a real-time image of the external scene. SVGS may not be used in lieu of natural vision. SVGS is intended to be used to increase situational awareness on the straight-in final approach segment of published instrument approaches and requires Special Authorization."], "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}
{"id": "instrument_procedures_handbook_SC_000365", "question": "What is a critical consideration when using anti-icing/de-icing equipment during flight?", "option": "Answer1: The equipment should be used before significant ice accumulation to ensure effectiveness Answer2: The equipment can remove all ice accumulation regardless of timing Answer3: The use of anti-icing/de-icing equipment does not affect power availability Answer4: Pilots do not need to consult the aircraft operator’s manual for using anti-icing/de-icing equipment", "answer": "answer1", "reference": ["Anti-icing/de-icing equipment is critical to safety of the flight. If anti-icing/de-icing equipment is not used before sufficient ice has accumulated, it may not be able to remove all ice accumulation. Use of anti-icing/de-icing reduces power availability; therefore, pilots should be familiar with the aircraft operator’s manual for use of anti-icing/de-icing equipment."], "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}

The gate is established along the final approach course one mile from the FAF on the side away from the airport and is no closer than 5 NM from the landing threshold.

In either case, the pilot should proceed direct to the IAF or to the IF/IAF associated with the sector that the aircraft will enter the TAA and join the approach course from that point and if required by that sector (i.e., sector is not labeled “NoPT), complete the HILO course reversal."], "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}

When departing with a SID, ATC expects you to fly the procedure as charted because the procedure design considers obstacle clearance. It is also expected that you will remain vigilant in scanning for traffic when departing in visual conditions. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to notify ATC if your clearance would endanger your safety or the safety of others.

Consideration was given to the wind drift on the dead reckoning entry leg at slower speeds, the turn radius at faster airspeeds, and the ability of the helicopter in strong wind conditions to intercept the inbound course prior to the holding fix. The published minimums are to be used with no visibility reductions allowed.
