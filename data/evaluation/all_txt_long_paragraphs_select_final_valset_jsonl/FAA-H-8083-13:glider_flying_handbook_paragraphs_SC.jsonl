Excessive use of the spoilers/dive brakes during the approach to land can easily lead to oscillations in pitch attitude and airspeed changes. The easiest way to guard against these oscillations is to make smooth adjustments in the spoilers/dive brakes setting whenever spoilers/dive brakes adjustment is necessary. This becomes particularly important during the landing flare just prior to touchdown. A sudden increase in spoilers/dive brakes extension results in a high sink rate and possible hard contact with the runway. This can lead to a rebound into the air, setting the stage for a series of PIOs. As before, the cure is to stabilize the glider, then resume the flare. If the spoilers/ dive brakes are retracted abruptly during the flare, the glider will probably balloon into the air because of the increased lift provided by the wings. Remember, spoiler/dive brakes provide drag and reduce lift. This extra lift and pilot reaction may result in overcontrolling and PIOs. The use of spoiler/ dive brakes should be determined by flight conditions.

Since the best lift in thermals is often found in a narrow cylinder near the core of the thermal, larger diameter circles generally mean the heavy glider is unable to exploit the strong lift of the thermal core, as well as the slower, lightweight glider.

As with roll oscillations, the problem is the failure of the pilot to recognize that the glider is accelerating and has considerable momentum. If the glider veers away from the towplane, rudder application in the appropriate direction helps correct the situation. If the rudder pressure is held too long, the large yaw momentum of the glider wings and fuselage results in overshooting the desired yaw position and veering off in the opposite direction. Overcompensating for large yaw, the pilot applies considerable rudder pressure in the direction opposite from the original rudder pressure. The alarmed pilot now applies considerable rudder pressure in the direction opposite the original rudder pressure. As the glider continues to accelerate, the power of the rudder increases and the lag time decreases. In extreme cases, the glider may veer off the runway and collide with runway border markers, airport lights, parked glider, or other obstacles. The cure for this type of yaw oscillation is anticipating the momentum of the glider wings and fuselage about the vertical axis and reduce rudder pedal pressure when the nose of the glider begins to yaw in the desired direction in response to rudder inputs.

The first priority is to make sure there is a suitable landing area within gliding distance. Then, if possible, try to find lift, even if it is weak, and climb. This buys time and gives a wider view of the area. Next, try to estimate the last known position, the course flown, and any possible differences in wind at altitude. For instance, maybe the headwind is stronger than anticipated and not as far along the course as expected. Try to pinpoint the present position from an estimate of the distance traveled for a given period of time and confirm it with visible landmarks by reference to the sectional chart. For instance, if at point X, averaging about 50 knots, heading north for about 30 minutes should put the glider at point Y. Look again at the sectional chart for landmarks that should be nearby point Y, then search the ground for these landmarks.

The stall speed of a glider can be affected by many factors, including weight, load factor due to maneuvering, and environmental conditions. As the weight of the glider increases, a higher AOA is required to maintain flight at the same airspeed since more lift is required to support the increase in weight. This is why a heavily loaded glider stalls at a higher airspeed than when lightly loaded. The manner in which this weight is distributed also affects stall speed. For example, a forward CG creates a situation that requires the tail to produce a greater downforce to balance the aircraft.
