There are many choices available, ranging from Family Radio Service (FRS) and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios, which are relatively low cost, to the more sophisticated FM business band systems, which can be expensive. The GMRS and FM radios require licensing by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). FRS radios do not. Using cell phones for air-ground communications is a violation of FCC rules. • Igniters—most manufacturers provide at least two sources of ignition on board. The best igniter is the simple welding striker. Nearly all balloons have built- in piezo ignition systems. • Fueling adapter—adapters are required to connect the balloon fuel tanks to the propane source. Pilots should carry their own adapters to ensure the adapters are clean and not worn. Dirty and worn adapters may damage a fuel system. • Compass—compasses are used to track pibals, check map orientations, and navigate the balloon. While almost any good quality compass will do, the best kind to use is probably the sighting compass. • Fire extinguisher—most balloons now come equipped with small fire extinguishers affixed to the basket. If one is present, it will be inspected during the annual inspection. These fire extinguishers are often too small to extinguish grass fires or serious basket fires caused by a propane leak. In the case of a propane-leak fire, turning off a valve usually extinguishes the fire. This is a better use of pilot time than fumbling for a fire extinguisher that might not extinguish the fire. • First aid kit—the location and contents of first aid kits vary.

A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air. Cold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, generally progressing at a rate of 25 to 30 miles per hour (mph). However, extreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at speeds of up to 60 mph. A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that of a warm front. Because it is so dense, it stays close to the ground and acts like a snowplow, sliding under the warmer air and forcing the less dense air aloft.

[Figure 4-10] In the Northern Hemisphere, the warm air at the equator rises upward from the surface, travels northward, and is deflected eastward by the rotation of the Earth. By the time it has traveled one-third of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward. This air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at about $30^{\\circ}$ latitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks toward the surface. Then, it flows southward along the surface back toward the equator. Coriolis force bends the flow to the right, thus creating the northeasterly trade winds that prevail from $30^{\\circ}$ latitude to the equator. Similar forces create circulation cells that encircle the Earth between"], "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}

(See chart of propane and butane partial pressures, Appendix C). T o ensure adequate pressure in cold weather, follow the manufacturer’s recommended method, which will be described in the flight manual. Many manufacturers recommend the use of nitrogen, an inert gas that may be added to the fuel tanks by means of a regulator. This is perhaps the easiest way to pressurize tanks, as it may be done on site, and with little or no prior planning. It does require the use of a nitrogen tank and a two-stage regulator. These items must be available to the pilot before the flight. If the flight is cancelled after pressurization, and the anticipated rise in temperature is expected to be more than $30^{\\circ}$ , the pressure will need to be bled off by using the fixed liquid level gauge."], "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}

If this flow is disturbed, a stable atmosphere will resist any upward or downward displacement. It will tend to return quickly to normal horizontal flow. An unstable atmosphere, on the other hand, will allow these upward and downward disturbances to grow, resulting in rough (turbulent) air. An example is the towering thunderstorm which grows as a result of large and intensive vertical movement or air.

A balloon is said to be “flying light” when the sine wave being described in the air is predominately on the high side of the desired altitude [Figure 7-3, Line B] . Many new or inexperienced pilots tend to fly light, and use the vent line in order to return to the desired altitude; this may create a situation where the pilot gets into a constant overcontrolling exercise and is best avoided. “Flying heavy” can be described as a scenario where the sine wave is predominately on the low side of the desired altitude [Figure 7-3, Line $C J$ ; if the balloon is left alone, it tends to fall. Flying heavy can be hazardous when contour flying. A balloon pilot must use all visual cues available and exercise a “finesse” type of control when contour flying (described later in this chapter)."], "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct"}
