Maintain coordinated flight by applying rudder in the direction of the turn. ⦁ Remember, the ailerons control the roll rate, as well as the angle of bank. The rate at which the aircraft rolls depends on how much aileron deflection is used. How far the aircraft rolls (steepness of the bank) depends on how long the ailerons are deflected, since the aircraft continues to roll as long as the ailerons are deflected. When the desired angle of bank is reached, neutralize the ailerons, and trim as appropriate. ⦁ Lead the roll-out by approximately one-half the number of degrees of the angle of bank.
