The unique design of the WSC aircraft performs the same function through the swept wing design, but also the wing twist and airfoil shape from root to tip assists in the correction about the vertical axis. A simple way to understand the yaw stability is to see that any yawing motion is reduced simply through the increased area of the wing as it rotates about its vertical axis.

When at very low angles or negative angles of attack, the WSC wing is designed so that the wing has positive stability or a nose- up aerodynamic moment. This is accomplished by a number of different systems (washout struts, sprogs and reﬂ ex lines) further explained in chapter 3 that simply keep the trailing edge of the wing up in an emergency low/negative AOA dive situation. As shown in Figure 2-29, the root area of the wing has reﬂ ex which creates a positive pitching moment for the root chord to rotate the nose up towards a level ﬂ ying attitude. At the same time, the tips are at a negative AOA producing lift in the opposite direction as usual, creating a moment to bring the nose/root chord up to a positive AOA to start producing lift and raising the nose to a normal ﬂ ight condition.

The higher the grade of gasoline, the more pressure the fuel can withstand without detonating.
