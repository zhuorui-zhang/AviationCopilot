In some cases, this lack of performance may not allow for a safe departure. In situations where a climb could avoid a weather or terrain hazard, the lack of performance might contribute to an incident or accident. • Payload–Does an aircraft have the capability to carry the passengers, baggage, cargo, and fuel for a planned flight?
